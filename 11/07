Yet, the high dimensionality and\nimprecision of text data, or more generally language as a whole, prove to be\nchallenging when attempting to perform unsupervised document clustering. In\nthis thesis, we present two novel methods for improving unsupervised document\nclustering/classification by theme. The first is to improve document\nrepresentations. We look to exploit \"term neighborhoods\" and \"blur\" semantic\nweight across neighboring terms. These neighborhoods are located in the\nsemantic space afforded by \"word embeddings.\" The second method is for cluster\nrevision, based on what we deem as \"stochastic barcoding\", or \"S- Barcode\"\npatterns. Text data is inherently high dimensional, yet clustering typically\ntakes place in a low dimensional representation space. Our method utilizes\nlower dimension clustering results as initial cluster configurations, and\niteratively revises the configuration in the high dimensional space. We show\nwith experimental results how both of the two methods improve the quality of\ndocument clustering.

Accordingly the conformal transformations'\nissue is discussed by invoking the assumed invariance of the laws of physics --\nin particular the laws of gravity -- under conformal transformations of the\nmetric. It is shown that Brans-Dicke and scalar-tensor theories are not\nwell-suited to address physical equivalence of the conformal frames since the\ncorresponding laws of gravity are not invariant under the conformal\ntransformations or Weyl rescalings. The search for conformal symmetry leads us\nto explore the physical consequences of Weyl-invariant theories of gravity,\nthat represent a natural arena where to discuss on physical equivalence of the\nconformally related representations.

Their spin swirling\ndirection, often termed as the magnetic helicity and defined as either\nleft-handed or right-handed, is uniquely determined by the\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in fixed chirality host crystals. Thus\nfar, there have been relatively few investigations of the DMI in metallic\nmagnets as compared with insulating counterparts.

This makes it impossible to empirically\ntest the structure of noise independently from the structure of preferences.\nHere, we show that the difficulty can be bypassed if data sets are enlarged to\ninclude response times. A simple condition on response time distributions (a\nweaker version of first order stochastic dominance) ensures that choices reveal\npreferences without assumptions on the structure of utility noise. Sharper\nresults are obtained if the analysis is restricted to specific classes of\nmodels. Under symmetric noise, response times allow to uncover preferences for\nchoice pairs outside the data set, and if noise is Fechnerian, even choice\nprobabilities can be forecast out of sample.

One important singularity is identified by the\nvanishing of the total energy, where the wavefunction reduces to the physics of\nscattering in flat space. In this paper, we discuss the behaviour of the\nperturbative wavefunction as its other singularities are approached and the\nrole played by the flat-space scattering, in the simplified context of the\nclass of toy models admitting a first principle definition in terms of\ncosmological polytopes. The problems then translates into the analysis of the\nstructure of its facets, one of which -- the scattering facet -- beautifully\nencodes the flat-space S-matrix. We show that all the boundaries of the\ncosmological polytope encode information about the flat-space physics. In\nparticular, a subset of its facets turns out to have a similar structure as the\nscattering facet, with the vertices which can be grouped together to form lower\ndimensional scattering facets. The other facets admit one (and only one)\ntriangulation in terms of products of lower dimensional scattering facets. As a\nconsequence, the whole perturbative wavefunction can be represented as a sum of\nproduct of flat-space scattering amplitudes. Finally, we turn the table around\nand ask whether the knowledge of the flat-space scattering amplitudes suffices\nto reconstruct the wavefunction of the universe.

Other significant developments include the successful\napplication of composite pulse techniques for accurate dynamical control of the\ncollective spin, enabled by broadband suppression of background magnetic fields\ninside a state-of-the-art magnetic shield. The absence of classical noise has\nallowed us to compare the observed quantum projection noise and squeezing to a\ntheoretical model that properly accounts for both the relevant atomic physics\nand the spatial mode of the collective spin, finding good quantitative\nagreement and thereby validating its use in other contexts. Thus, our work sets\nthe stage for experiments on quantum feedback, deterministic squeezing,\nclosed-loop magnetometry, and new types of quantum simulation based on\ncontinuous QND measurement and feedback.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Nov 2018 17:40:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 2020 23:45:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-01"}

These breather\noscillations emerge spontaneously, and their frequency is determined by the\nsystem parameters. Here we propose and theoretically investigate the\npossibility that these breather oscillations may become subharmonically\nentrained to the periodic perturbation occurring at the resonator round-trip\ntime $T_R$ that arises from out-coupling and pumping. The result of subharmonic\nentrainment is an integer ratio $T_b/T_R=N\\gg1$ between the breather period\n$T_b$ and the round-trip time. We find that in a regime of intermediate\nresonator finesse ($\\mathcal{F}\\sim30-40$), rigid subharmonic entrainment---or\nlocking of the breather oscillation to the round-trip time---occurs and is\nmaintained over a range of system parameters.

Much work has been done in AI over the years at\nlower levels, but a big part of what has been missing involves the high level,\nabstract, general nature of intelligence. We address this gap by developing a\nmodel for general intelligence. To accomplish this, we focus on three basic\naspects of intelligence. First, we must realize the general order and nature of\nintelligence at a high level. Second, we must come to know what these\nrealizations mean with respect to the overall intelligence process. Third, we\nmust describe these realizations as clearly as possible. We propose a\nhierarchical model to help capture and exploit the order within intelligence.\nThe underlying order involves patterns of signals that become organized, stored\nand activated in space and time. These patterns can be described using a\nsimple, general hierarchy, with physical signals at the lowest level,\ninformation in the middle, and abstract signal representations at the top. This\nhigh level perspective provides a big picture that literally helps us see the\nintelligence process, thereby enabling fundamental realizations, a better\nunderstanding and clear descriptions of the intelligence process.

Maximum-Likelihood (MLE)\nmodels trained with teacher forcing have consistently been reported as weak\nbaselines, where poor performance is attributed to exposure bias (Bengio et\nal., 2015; Ranzato et al., 2015); at inference time, the model is fed its own\nprediction instead of a ground-truth token, which can lead to accumulating\nerrors and poor samples. This line of reasoning has led to an outbreak of\nadversarial based approaches for NLG, on the account that GANs do not suffer\nfrom exposure bias. In this work, we make several surprising observations which\ncontradict common beliefs. First, we revisit the canonical evaluation framework\nfor NLG, and point out fundamental flaws with quality-only evaluation: we show\nthat one can outperform such metrics using a simple, well-known temperature\nparameter to artificially reduce the entropy of the model's conditional\ndistributions.

Our approach to this question is operational and leads us\nto also revisit the notion of local inertial frames, arising in operational\nformulations of the equivalence and Mach's principle, both of which can be\ninterpreted in generalized geometries. We extend the notion of inertial\nlaboratory frames by taking serious that all matter inside the lab is\nfundamentally quantum and considering how it may couple to the quantum\ngravitational degrees of freedom generating the ambient effective spacetime\nstructure. This revolves around the question of which structures an agent\ninside the inertial laboratory has available to operationally define the\norientation of their reference frame, an aspect on which both the equivalence\nand Mach's principle are silent. We then contemplate the situation of a\ncompletely inertial laboratory, which, in terms of the quantum matter\nexperiments inside it, is not only isolated from any matter outside it, but\nalso from a direct coupling to effective quantum gravitational degrees of\nfreedom. We formulate this as a local Mach principle (LMP): a local inertial\nlaboratory has to be self-sufficient, so that an agent can only resort to\nrelations among the quantum matter systems inside it to self-generate any\nreference structures relative to which to orient their frame. The\ntransformations between different frame orientations thereby originate in the\nlocal quantum matter structures. Combining this with dispersion relations leads\nto various non-trivial compatibility conditions on the spacetime structures\nencoded by them. This permits us to formulate additional operational\nassumptions under which the LMP singles out Lorentzian metric spacetimes within\ngeneralized geometries defined by dispersion relations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Nov 2018 18:56:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-07"}

We show that (1) the partial spatial separation of the wave\nfunctions of the component Majorana bound states (MBSs) is crucial for the\ncreation and stability of topologically trivial near-zero-energy Andreev bound\nstates, (2) the signs of the spin polarizations of the component MBSs can be\neither the same or opposite, depending on the profile of the inducing\npotential, and (3) the spin polarizations do not play a fundamental role in\ngenerating vastly different coupling strengths to local probes and/or ensuring\nthe robustness of the near-zero-energy ABS. Consequently, in contrast to recent\ntheoretical claims (Vuik et al., arXiv:1806.02801), we find that a robust,\nquantized zero-bias conductance plateau of height 2e^2/h measured in the\ntopologically trivial regime necessarily requires partially separated ABSs\n(ps-ABSs), independent of the relative signs of the spin-polarizations. In\naddition, we show that (4) well-defined energy splitting oscillations involve\nMBSs characterized by exponential tails pointing toward each other, and (5)\nps-ABSs generated by the tunnel barrier itself produce zero-bias conductance\npeaks with a characteristic width that increases strongly with the applied\nmagnetic field. Finally, we propose (6) a quantitative scheme for analyzing the\nstability of Majorana modes based on probability distributions of splitting\nsusceptibilities and show that a ps-ABS mode can be remarkably robust when\njudged based on its signature in a charge tunneling experiment, but, in\nessence, is topologically unprotected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Nov 2018 18:58:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 20:34:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-31"}

One of the most intriguing suggestions\nto resolve the information paradox is due to Bekenstein, who has stressed the\nfact that the low-energy part of the semi-classical black-hole emission\nspectrum is partly blocked by the curvature potential that surrounds the black\nhole. As explicitly shown by Bekenstein, this fact implies that the grey-body\nemission spectrum of a (3+1)-dimensional black hole is considerably less\nentropic than the corresponding radiation spectrum of a perfectly thermal\nblack-body emitter. Using standard ideas from quantum information theory, it\nwas shown by Bekenstein that, in principle, the filtered Hawking radiation\nemitted by a (3+1)-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole may carry with it a\nsubstantial amount of information, the information which was suspected to be\nlost.

In the present paper we analyze the\nsemi-classical entropy emission properties of higher-dimensional black holes.\nIn particular, we provide evidence that the characteristic Hawking quanta of\n$(D+1)$-dimensional Schwarzschild black holes in the large $D\\gg1$ regime are\nalmost unaffected by the spacetime curvature outside the black-hole horizon.\nThis fact implies that, in the large-$D$ regime, the Hawking black-hole\nradiation spectra are almost purely thermal, thus suggesting that the emitted\nquanta cannot carry the amount of information which is required in order to\nresolve the information paradox. Our analysis therefore suggests that the\nelegant information leak scenario suggested by Bekenstein cannot provide a\ngeneric resolution to the intriguing Hawking information paradox.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Nov 2018 19:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}

The\npredictions made by the agent are contingent on a particular way of behaving,\nrepresented as a value function. However, the behavior used to select actions\nand generate the behavior data might be different from the one used to define\nthe predictions, and thus the samples are generated off-policy. The ability to\nlearn behavior-contingent predictions online and off-policy has long been\nadvocated as a key capability of predictive-knowledge learning systems but\nremained an open algorithmic challenge for decades. The issue lies with the\ntemporal difference (TD) learning update at the heart of most prediction\nalgorithms: combining bootstrapping, off-policy sampling and function\napproximation may cause the value estimate to diverge. A breakthrough came with\nthe development of a new objective function that admitted stochastic gradient\ndescent variants of TD. Since then, many sound online off-policy prediction\nalgorithms have been developed, but there has been limited empirical work\ninvestigating the relative merits of all the variants. This paper aims to fill\nthese empirical gaps and provide clarity on the key ideas behind each method.\nWe summarize the large body of literature on off-policy learning, focusing on\n1- methods that use computation linear in the number of features and are\nconvergent under off-policy sampling, and 2- other methods which have proven\nuseful with non-fixed, nonlinear function approximation. We provide an\nempirical study of off-policy prediction methods in two challenging\nmicroworlds.

Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) is a standard tool for\ninference of individual-level pollutant health-effects, and we present a mean\nfield Variational Inference (VI) algorithm for quick inference when only a\nsingle response per individual is recorded. Using simulation studies in the\ncase of informative priors, we show that VI, although fast, produces\nanti-conservative credible intervals of covariate effects and conservative\ncredible intervals for pollutant effects. To correct the coverage probabilities\nof covariate effects, we propose a simple Generalized Least Squares (GLS)\napproach that induces conservative credible intervals. We also explore using\nBKMR with flat priors and find that, while slower than the case with\ninformative priors, this approach yields uncorrected credible intervals for\ncovariate effects with coverage probabilities that are much closer to the\nnominal 95% level. We further note that fitting BKMR by VI provides a\nremarkable improvement in speed over existing MCMC methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Nov 2018 19:56:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-08"}

In real-world\napplications, each node is typically linked to only a small subset of other\nnodes. Hence, practical approaches to problems such as node labeling have to\ncope with the resulting sparse networks. While low-dimensional network\nembeddings offer a promising approach to this problem, most of the current\nnetwork embedding methods focus primarily on single view networks. We introduce\na novel multi-view network embedding (MVNE) algorithm for constructing\nlow-dimensional node embeddings from multi-view networks.

Therefore there is a very tight\ncoupling between the object shape, structural properties, and the precise\nlayout of the elements.\n  We present the first method to create aggregates of elements that are\nstructurally sound and can be manufactured on 3D printers. Rather than having\nto assemble an aggregate shape by painstakingly positioning elements one by\none, users of our method only have to describe the structural purpose of the\ndesired object. This is done by specifying a set of external forces and\nattachment points. The algorithm then automatically optimizes a layout of\nuser-provided elements that answers the specified scenario. The elements can\nhave arbitrary shapes: convex, concave, elongated, and can be allowed to\ndeform.\n  Our approach creates connections between elements through small overlaps\npreserving their appearance, while optimizing for the global rigidity of the\nresulting aggregate.

The modulation is defined by the sampling of a\ntwo-dimensional surface, which provides the lattices with topological\nproperties that are usually attributed to two-dimensional crystals. We show\nthat the cyclic variation of the phase of the stiffness modulation leads to a\nBerry phase accumulation for the Bloch eigenmodes, which is characterized by\ninteger valued Chern numbers for the bands and associated gap labels. The\nresulting non-trivial gaps are spanned by edge modes localized at one of the\nboundaries of the considered 1D lattices. The edge mode location is governed by\nthe phase of the stiffness distribution, whose spatial modulation drives these\nmodes to transition from one edge to the other, through a bulk state that\noccurs when the corresponding dispersion branch touches the bulk bands. This\nproperty enables the implementation of a topological pump that is obtained by\nstacking and coupling a family of modulated 1D lattices along a second spatial\ndimension. The gradual variation of the stiffness phase modulation drives the\nadiabatic transition of the edge states, which transition from their localized\nstate at one boundary, to a bulk mode and, finally, to another localized state\nat the opposite boundary. Similar effects were illustrated under the assumption\nof quasiperiodic modulation of the lattice interactions.

Thus one or more\nongoing processes probably maintain its brightness.

Because of the relatively simple networks\ncontrolling their abundances, molecular ions are usually good probes of the\nunderlying physical conditions including for instance the fraction of gas in\nmolecular form or the fractional ionization. In this paper we focus on three\npossible probes of the molecular hydrogen column density, HCO+, HOC+, and CF+.\nWe presented high sensitivity ALMA absorption data toward a sample of compact\nHII regions and bright QSOs with prominent foreground absorption, in the ground\nstate transitions of the molecular ions HCO+, HOC+, and CF+ and the neutral\nspecies HCN and HNC, and from the excited state transitions of C3H+(4-3) and\n13CS(2-1). These data are compared with Herschel absorption spectra of the\nground state transition of HF and p-H2O. We show that the HCO+, HOC+, and CF+\ncolumn densities are well correlated with each other. HCO+ and HOC+ are tightly\ncorrelated with p-H2O, while they exhibit a different correlation pattern with\nHF depending on whether the absorbing matter is located in the Galactic disk or\nin the central molecular zone. We report new detections of C3H+ confirming that\nthis ion is ubiquitous in the diffuse matter, with an abundance relative to H2\nof ~7E-11.

For general graphs with $k$\nterminal pairs, the flow-cut gap is $O(\\log k)$, and this is tight. But when\ntopological restrictions are placed on the flow network, the situation is far\nless clear. In particular, it has been conjectured that the flow-cut gap in\nplanar networks is $O(1)$, while the known bounds place the gap somewhere\nbetween $2$ (Lee and Raghavendra, 2003) and $O(\\sqrt{\\log k})$ (Rao, 1999).\n  A seminal result of Okamura and Seymour (1981) shows that when all the\nterminals of a planar network lie on a single face, the flow-cut gap is exactly\n$1$. This setting can be generalized by considering planar networks where the\nterminals lie on $\\gamma>1$ faces in some fixed planar drawing. Lee and\nSidiropoulos (2009) proved that the flow-cut gap is bounded by a function of\n$\\gamma$, and Chekuri, Shepherd, and Weibel (2013) showed that the gap is at\nmost $3\\gamma$. We prove that the flow-cut gap is $O(\\log\\gamma)$, by showing\nthat the edge-weighted shortest-path metric induced on the terminals admits a\nstochastic embedding into trees with distortion $O(\\log\\gamma)$, which is\ntight.\n  The preceding results refer to the setting of edge-capacitated networks. For\nvertex-capacitated networks, it can be significantly more challenging to\ncontrol flow-cut gaps. While there is no exact vertex-capacitated version of\nthe Okamura-Seymour Theorem, an approximate version holds; Lee, Mendel, and\nMoharrami (2015) showed that the vertex-capacitated flow-cut gap is $O(1)$ on\nplanar networks whose terminals lie on a single face. We prove that the\nflow-cut gap is $O(\\gamma)$ for vertex-capacitated instances when the terminals\nlie on at most $\\gamma$ faces. In fact, this result holds in the more general\nsetting of submodular vertex capacities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Nov 2018 22:04:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-08"}

Full coverage of the left ventricle (LV),\nfrom base to apex, is a basic criterion for CMR image quality and necessary for\naccurate measurement of cardiac volume and functional assessment. Incomplete\ncoverage of the LV is identified through visual inspection, which is\ntime-consuming and usually done retrospectively in the assessment of large\nimaging cohorts. This paper proposes a novel automatic method for determining\nLV coverage from CMR images by using Fisher-discriminative three-dimensional\n(FD3D) convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In contrast to our previous method\nemploying 2D CNNs, this approach utilizes spatial contextual information in CMR\nvolumes, extracts more representative high-level features and enhances the\ndiscriminative capacity of the baseline 2D CNN learning framework, thus\nachieving superior detection accuracy. A two-stage framework is proposed to\nidentify missing basal and apical slices in measurements of CMR volume. First,\nthe FD3D CNN extracts high-level features from the CMR stacks. These image\nrepresentations are then used to detect the missing basal and apical slices.\nCompared to the traditional 3D CNN strategy, the proposed FD3D CNN minimizes\nwithin-class scatter and maximizes between-class scatter. We performed\nextensive experiments to validate the proposed method on more than 5,000\nindependent volumetric CMR scans from the UK Biobank study, achieving low error\nrates for missing basal/apical slice detection (4.9\\%/4.6\\%).

Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms require solving a\nnonconvex and nonlinear unconstrained optimization problem. Methods for solving\nthe optimization problems in deep RL are restricted to the class of first-order\nalgorithms, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The major drawback of\nthe SGD methods is that they have the undesirable effect of not escaping saddle\npoints and their performance can be seriously obstructed by ill-conditioning.\nFurthermore, SGD methods require exhaustive trial and error to fine-tune many\nlearning parameters. Using second derivative information can result in improved\nconvergence properties, but computing the Hessian matrix for large-scale\nproblems is not practical. Quasi-Newton methods require only first-order\ngradient information, like SGD, but they can construct a low rank approximation\nof the Hessian matrix and result in superlinear convergence. The limited-memory\nBroyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS) approach is one of the most popular\nquasi-Newton methods that construct positive definite Hessian approximations.\nIn this paper, we introduce an efficient optimization method, based on the\nlimited memory BFGS quasi-Newton method using line search strategy -- as an\nalternative to SGD methods.

This\nworkshop bring together researchers applying compositional approaches to\nphysics, NLP, cognitive science, and game theory. Within NLP, a long-standing\naim is to represent how words can combine to form phrases and sentences. Within\nthe framework of distributional semantics, words are represented as vectors in\nvector spaces. The categorical model of Coecke et al. [2010], inspired by\nquantum protocols, has provided a convincing account of compositionality in\nvector space models of NLP. There is furthermore a history of vector space\nmodels in cognitive science. Theories of categorization such as those developed\nby Nosofsky [1986] and Smith et al. [1988] utilise notions of distance between\nfeature vectors. More recently G\\\"ardenfors [2004, 2014] has developed a model\nof concepts in which conceptual spaces provide geometric structures, and\ninformation is represented by points, vectors and regions in vector spaces. The\nsame compositional approach has been applied to this formalism, giving\nconceptual spaces theory a richer model of compositionality than previously\n[Bolt et al., 2018]. Compositional approaches have also been applied in the\nstudy of strategic games and Nash equilibria. In contrast to classical game\ntheory, where games are studied monolithically as one global object,\ncompositional game theory works bottom-up by building large and complex games\nfrom smaller components. Such an approach is inherently difficult since the\ninteraction between games has to be considered. Research into categorical\ncompositional methods for this field have recently begun [Ghani et al., 2018].\nMoreover, the interaction between the three disciplines of cognitive science,\nlinguistics and game theory is a fertile ground for research. Game theory in\ncognitive science is a well-established area [Camerer, 2011]. Similarly game\ntheoretic approaches have been applied in linguistics [J\\\"ager, 2008]. Lastly,\nthe study of linguistics and cognitive science is intimately intertwined\n[Smolensky and Legendre, 2006, Jackendoff, 2007]. Physics supplies\ncompositional approaches via vector spaces and categorical quantum theory,\nallowing the interplay between the three disciplines to be examined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Nov 2018 23:25:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-08"}

Mixtures are also convenient in\ndealing with contaminated sampling models and models with multiple equilibria.\nThis paper shows that finite mixture models are nonparametrically identified\nunder weak assumptions that are plausible in economic applications. The key is\nto utilize the identification power implied by information in covariates\nvariation. First, three identification approaches are presented, under distinct\nand non-nested sets of sufficient conditions. Observable features of data\ninform us which of the three approaches is valid. These results apply to\ngeneral nonparametric switching regressions, as well as to structural\neconometric models, such as auction models with unobserved heterogeneity.\nSecond, some extensions of the identification results are developed. In\nparticular, a mixture regression where the mixing weights depend on the value\nof the regressors in a fully unrestricted manner is shown to be\nnonparametrically identifiable. This means a finite mixture model with\nfunction-valued unobserved heterogeneity can be identified in a cross-section\nsetting, without restricting the dependence pattern between the regressor and\nthe unobserved heterogeneity. In this aspect it is akin to fixed effects panel\ndata models which permit unrestricted correlation between unobserved\nheterogeneity and covariates. Third, the paper shows that fully nonparametric\nestimation of the entire mixture model is possible, by forming a sample\nanalogue of one of the new identification strategies.

However, GNSS-based time synchronization is not well understood for its\nrole in the coordination of various tasks in VANETs. To address this issue,\nthis paper examines the requirements, potential benefits, and feasibility of\nGNSS time synchronization in VANETs. The availability of GNSS time\nsynchronization is characterized by almost 100% in our experiments in high-rise\nurban streets, where the availability of GNSS positioning solutions is only\n80%. Experiments are also conducted to test the accuracy of time\nsynchronization with 1-PPS signals output from consumer grade GNSS receivers.\nThey have shown 30-ns synchronization accuracy between two receivers of\ndifferent models. All these experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of\nGNSS time synchronization for stringent VANET applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Nov 2018 02:58:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-08"}

Taken together, these surveys will achieve an\narray of important scientific goals: measuring the equation of state of dark\nenergy out to z ~ 3 with percent-level precision measurements of the cosmic\nexpansion rate; constraining possible deviations from General Relativity on\ncosmological scales by measuring the growth rate of structure through multiple\nindependent methods; mapping the structure of the Universe on the largest\naccessible scales, thus constraining fundamental properties such as isotropy,\nhomogeneity, and non-Gaussianity; and measuring the HI density and bias out to\nz = 6. These surveys will also provide highly complementary clustering and weak\nlensing measurements that have independent systematic uncertainties to those of\noptical surveys like LSST and Euclid, leading to a multitude of synergies that\ncan improve constraints significantly beyond what optical or radio surveys can\nachieve on their own.

Here we explore a series of metallic charge- and\nspin-density-wave systems that exhibit extremely large positive linear\nmagnetoresistance. By contrast to other linear MR mechanisms, this effect\nremains robust down to miniscule magnetic fields of tens of Oersted at low\ntemperature. We frame an explanation of this phenomenon in a semi-classical\nnarrative for a broad category of materials with partially-gapped Fermi\nsurfaces due to density waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Nov 2018 04:47:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

Without learning\nfrom much richer contexts, these methods are susceptible to the presence of\nsharp road curves, challenging traffic conditions, strong shadows, and severe\nlighting changes. In this paper, we considerably improve the accuracy and\nrobustness of predictions through heterogeneous auxiliary networks feature\nmimicking, a new and effective training method that provides us with much\nricher contextual signals apart from steering direction. Specifically, we train\nour steering angle predictive model by distilling multi-layer knowledge from\nmultiple heterogeneous auxiliary networks that perform related but different\ntasks, e.g., image segmentation or optical flow estimation. As opposed to\nmulti-task learning, our method does not require expensive annotations of\nrelated tasks on the target set. This is made possible by applying contemporary\noff-the-shelf networks on the target set and mimicking their features in\ndifferent layers after transformation. The auxiliary networks are discarded\nafter training without affecting the runtime efficiency of our model. Our\napproach achieves a new state-of-the-art on Udacity and Comma.ai, outperforming\nthe previous best by a large margin of 12.8% and 52.1%, respectively.\nEncouraging results are also shown on Berkeley Deep Drive (BDD) dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Nov 2018 04:47:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-08"}

This\nmethod enables us to provide efficient implementations for approximating\nweighted matchings in the streaming model and in the massively parallel\ncomputation (MPC) model.\n  In the context of streaming with random edge arrivals, our techniques yield a\n$(1/2+c)$-approximation algorithm thus breaking the natural barrier of $1/2$.\nFor multi-pass streaming and the MPC model, we show that any algorithm\ncomputing a $(1-\\delta)$-approximate unweighted matching in bipartite graphs\ncan be translated into an algorithm that computes a\n$(1-\\varepsilon(\\delta))$-approximate maximum weighted matching. Furthermore,\nthis translation incurs only a constant factor (that depends on $\\varepsilon>\n0$) overhead in the complexity. Instantiating this with the current best\nmulti-pass streaming and MPC algorithms for unweighted matchings yields the\nfollowing results for maximum weighted matchings:\n  * A $(1-\\varepsilon)$-approximation streaming algorithm that uses\n$O_\\varepsilon(1)$ passes and $O_\\varepsilon(n\\, \\text{poly} (\\log n))$ memory.\nThis is the first $(1-\\varepsilon)$-approximation streaming algorithm for\nweighted matchings that uses a constant number of passes (only depending on\n$\\varepsilon$).\n  * A $(1 - \\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm in the MPC model that uses\n$O_\\varepsilon(\\log \\log n)$ rounds, $O(m/n)$ machines per round, and\n$O_\\varepsilon(n\\, \\text{poly}(\\log n))$ memory per machine.

Audio Word2Vec previously\nproposed was shown to be able to represent audio segments for spoken words as\nsuch vectors carrying information about the phonetic structures of the signal\nsegments. However, each linguistic unit (word, syllable, phoneme in text form)\ncorresponds to unlimited number of audio segments with vector representations\ninevitably spread over the embedding space, which causes some confusion. It is\ntherefore desired to better cluster the audio embeddings such that those\ncorresponding to the same linguistic unit can be more compactly distributed. In\nthis paper, inspired by Siamese networks, we propose some approaches to achieve\nthe above goal. This includes identifying positive and negative pairs from\nunlabeled data for Siamese style training, disentangling acoustic factors such\nas speaker characteristics from the audio embedding, handling unbalanced data\ndistribution, and having the embedding processes learn from the adjacency\nrelationships among data points. All these can be done in an unsupervised way.\nImproved performance was obtained in preliminary experiments on the LibriSpeech\ndata set, including clustering characteristics analysis and applications of\nspoken term detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Nov 2018 06:18:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-08"}

Based on the observation that buildings in VHSR-RS\nimages are always more distinguishable in geometry than in texture or spectral\ndomain, this paper proposes a geometric building index (GBI) for accurate\nbuilding extraction, by computing the geometric saliency from VHSR-RS images.\nMore precisely, given an image, the geometric saliency is derived from a\nmid-level geometric representations based on meaningful junctions that can\nlocally describe geometrical structures of images.

Detection of the end-diastolic frame (EDF) and, in\ngeneral, cardiac phase detection on each temporal frame of a coronary\nangiography acquisition is of significant importance for the anatomical and\nnon-invasive functional assessment of CAD. This task is generally performed via\nmanual frame selection or semi-automated selection based on simultaneously\nacquired ECG signals - thus introducing the requirement of simultaneous ECG\nrecordings. We evaluate the performance of a purely image based workflow based\non deep neural networks for fully automated cardiac phase and EDF detection on\ncoronary angiographies. A first deep neural network (DNN), trained to detect\ncoronary arteries, is employed to preselect a subset of frames in which\ncoronary arteries are well visible. A second DNN predicts cardiac phase labels\nfor each frame. Only in the training and evaluation phases for the second DNN,\nECG signals are used to provide ground truth labels for each angiographic\nframe. The networks were trained on 17800 coronary angiographies from 3900\npatients and evaluated on 27900 coronary angiographies from 6250 patients. No\nexclusion criteria related to patient state, previous interventions, or\npathology were formulated.

Several sub-group\nanalyses were performed, indicating that the cardiac phase detection\nperformance is largely independent from acquisition angles and the heart rate\nof the patient. The average execution time of cardiac phase detection for one\nangiographic series was on average less than five seconds on a standard\nworkstation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Nov 2018 08:23:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-08"}

With the emergence of online social networks, social\nrecommendation has become a popular research direction. Most of these social\nrecommendation models utilized each user's local neighbors' preferences to\nalleviate the data sparsity issue in CF. However, they only considered the\nlocal neighbors of each user and neglected the process that users' preferences\nare influenced as information diffuses in the social network. Recently, Graph\nConvolutional Networks~(GCN) have shown promising results by modeling the\ninformation diffusion process in graphs that leverage both graph structure and\nnode feature information. To this end, in this paper, we propose an effective\ngraph convolutional neural network based model for social recommendation. Based\non a classical CF model, the key idea of our proposed model is that we borrow\nthe strengths of GCNs to capture how users' preferences are influenced by the\nsocial diffusion process in social networks. The diffusion of users'\npreferences is built on a layer-wise diffusion manner, with the initial user\nembedding as a function of the current user's features and a free base user\nlatent vector that is not contained in the user feature. Similarly, each item's\nlatent vector is also a combination of the item's free latent vector, as well\nas its feature representation. Furthermore, we show that our proposed model is\nflexible when user and item features are not available.

Generally, the modification of\ngate voltage ($V_{\\rm G}$) in EDLT devices produces a direct change on the\ndoping level, whereas the processing temperature ($T_{\\rm G}$) at which $V_{\\rm\nG}$ is applied only assists the tuning process.

Characterizing the origins, types and\ncompetitive strength of different kinds of power may yield a scaffolding for\nunderstanding historical processes and mechanisms for winning or avoiding\nconflicts. Michael Mann distinguished four types of power: political, military,\neconomic, and ideological. We show this framework is justified by four\nmotivations of individuals to transfer decisions to leaders: Desire to be a\nmember of a collective, avoiding harm due to threat, gaining benefit due to\npayment, acquiring a value system. Constructing models of societies based upon\nthese types of power enables distinguishing social systems and describing their\ndynamics. Dynamics include (a) competition between power systems, (b)\ncompetition between powerful individuals, and (c) the dynamics of values within\na powerful individual. A historical trend is the progressive separation of\ntypes of power to distinct groups of individuals. In ancient empires all forms\nof power were concentrated in a single individual, e.g. Caesar during the Pax\nRomana period. In an idealized modern democratic state, the four types of power\nare concentrated in distinct sets of individuals. The progressive separation\nsuggests that in some contexts this confers a \"fitness\" advantage in an\nevolutionary process similar to the selection of biological organisms. However,\nindividual countries may not separate power completely. The influence of wealth\nin politics and regulatory capture is a signature of economic leader dominance,\ne.g. the US. Important roles of political leaders in economics and corruption\nare a signature of the political leader dominance, e.g. China. Ideological\nleaders dominate in theocracies, e.g. Iran. Military leaders dominate in\ndictatorships or where military leaders select leadership, e.g. Egypt.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Nov 2018 14:07:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-08"}

Deformations, and the\ncorresponding change in solid contact area and aperture field, impact rock\nfracture stiffness and permeability thus altering the reservoir properties\nsignificantly. Simulating contact between fractures is numerically difficult as\nthe non-penetration constraints lead to a nonlinear problem and the surface\nmeshes of the solid bodies on the opposing fracture sides may be non-matching.\nFurthermore, the challenging geometry of the arising constraints requires to\nsolve the problem in several iterations, adjusting the constraints in each one.\nHere we present a novel discrete implementation of a dual mortar method and a\nnon-smooth SQP solver, suitable for parallel computing, and apply it to a two\nbody contact problem consisting of realistic rock fracture geometries from the\nGrimsel underground laboratory in Switzerland. The contributions of this\narticle are: 1) a novel, parallel implementation of a dual mortar method and\nnon-smooth SQP method, 2) realistic rock geometries with rough surfaces, and 3)\nnumerical examples, which prove that the dual mortar method is capable of\nreplicating the nonlinear closure behavior of fractures, observed in laboratory\nexperiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Nov 2018 14:48:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2019 14:23:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-06"}

In line\nwith the literature on Interactive Democracy, our model allows the voters to\nactively determine the degree to which the system is direct versus\nrepresentative. However, unlike Liquid Democracy, Flexible Representative\nDemocracy uses strictly non-transitive delegations, making delegation cycles\nimpossible, and maintains a fixed set of accountable, elected representatives.\nWe present FRD and analyze it using a computational approach with issues that\nare binary and symmetric. We compare the outcomes of various voting systems\nusing Direct Democracy with majority voting as an ideal baseline. First, we\ndemonstrate the shortcomings of Representative Democracy in our model.

The occurrence of such features requires a dense\nenvironment with temperatures near $10^6$K, by far exceeding the stellar\neffective temperature. Here we report the discovery of a new hot wind white\ndwarf, GALEXJ014636.8+323615. Astonishingly, we found for the first time rapid\nchanges of the equivalent widths of the UHE features, which are correlated to\nthe rotational period of the star ($P=0.242035$d). We explain this with the\npresence of a wind-fed circumstellar magnetosphere in which magnetically\nconfined wind shocks heat up the material to the high temperatures required for\nthe creation of the UHE lines. The photometric and spectroscopic variability of\nGALEXJ014636.8+323615 can then be understood as consequence of the obliquity of\nthe magnetic axis with respect to the rotation axis of the white dwarf. This is\nthe first time a wind-fed circumstellar magnetosphere around an apparently\nisolated white dwarf has been discovered and finally offers a plausible\nexplanation of the ultra hot wind phenomenon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Nov 2018 15:08:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-08"}

Another considerable fraction of channels does not record any neural\ndata, but external artifacts and noise. Therefore, an automatic identification\nand tracking of channels containing neural data is of great significance and\ncan accelerate the process of analysis, e.g. automatic selection of meaningful\nchannels during offline and online spike sorting. Another important aspect is\nthe selection of meaningful channels during online decoding in brain-computer\ninterface applications, where threshold crossing events are usually for feature\nextraction, even though they do not necessarily correspond to neural events.\nHere, we propose a novel algorithm based on the newly introduced way of feature\nvector extraction and a supervised deep learning method: a universal spike\nclassifier (USC). The USC enables us to address both above-raised issues. The\nUSC uses the standard architecture of convolutional neural networks (Conv net).\nIt takes the batch of the waveforms, instead of a single waveform as an input,\npropagates it through the multilayered structure, and finally classifies it as\na channel containing neural spike data or artifacts.

We work towards an answer to this question for the\nbounded-degree graph model introduced in [Goldreich, Ron, 2002], where the\ninput graphs have maximum degree bounded by a constant $d$. In this model, it\nis known (among other results) that every \\emph{hyperfinite} property is\nconstant-query testable [Newman, Sohler, 2013], where, informally, a graph\nproperty is hyperfinite, if for every $\\delta >0$ every graph in the property\ncan be partitioned into small connected components by removing $\\delta n$\nedges.\n  In this paper we show that hyperfiniteness plays a role in \\emph{every}\ntestable property, i.e. we show that every testable property is either finite\n(which trivially implies hyperfiniteness and testability) or contains an\ninfinite hyperfinite subproperty. A simple consequence of our result is that no\ninfinite graph property that only consists of expander graphs is constant-query\ntestable.\n  Based on the above findings, one could ask if every infinite testable\nnon-hyperfinite property might contain an infinite family of expander (or\nnear-expander) graphs.

We proved that related to the mentioned Coxeter tilings the\ndensity of the densest congruent hyperball packing is $\\approx 0.81335$ that is\n-- by our conjecture -- the upper bound density of the relating non-congruent\nhyperball packings too.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Nov 2018 12:47:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-09"}

Despite successes of multifractal analysis in various\nreal-world applications, current estimation procedures remain essentially\nlimited to providing concave upper-bound estimates, while there is a priori no\nreason for the multifractal spectrum to be a concave function. This work\naddresses this severe practical limitation and proposes a novel formalism for\nmultifractal analysis that enables nonconcave multifractal spectra to be\nestimated in a stable way. The key contributions reside in the development and\ntheoretical study of a generalized multifractal formalism to assess the\nmultiscale statistics of wavelet leaders, and in devising a practical algorithm\nthat permits this formalism to be applied to real-world data, allowing for the\nestimation of nonconcave multifractal spectra. Numerical experiments are\nconducted on several synthetic multifractal processes as well as on a\nreal-world remote-sensing image and demonstrate the benefits of the proposed\nmultifractal formalism over the state of the art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Nov 2018 14:38:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-09"}

In this\nwork, we introduce a complete probabilistic model of the Bitcoin Blockchain. We\nfirst formulate a set of conditional dependencies induced by the Bitcoin\nprotocol at the block level and derive a corresponding fully observed graphical\nmodel of a Bitcoin block. We then extend the model to include hidden entity\nattributes such as the functional category of the associated logical agent and\nderive asymptotic bounds on the privacy properties implied by this model. At\nthe network level, we show evidence of complex transaction-to-transaction\nbehavior and present a relevant discriminative model of the agent categories.\nPerformance of both the block-based graphical model and the network-level\ndiscriminative model is evaluated on a subset of the public Bitcoin Blockchain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Nov 2018 02:35:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-14"}
