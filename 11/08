At the same time, additional information on the\npredictors is available in many applications but left unused.

A key information necessary to unveil\nits microscopic origin is the geometry of the Fermi surface hosting the Cooper\npairs as a function of field-effect doping, which is dictated by the filling of\nthe inequivalent valleys at the K/K$^{\\prime}$ and Q/Q$^{\\prime}$ points of the\nBrillouin Zone. Here, we achieve this by combining Density Functional Theory\ncalculations of the bandstructure with transport measurements on ion-gated\n2H-MoS$_{2}$ nanolayers. We show that, when the number of layers and the amount\nof strain are set to their experimental values, the Fermi level crosses the\nbottom of the high-energy valleys at Q/Q$^{\\prime}$ at doping levels where\ncharacteristic kinks in the transconductance are experimentally detected. We\nalso develop a simple 2D model which is able to quantitatively describe the\nbroadening of the kinks observed upon increasing temperature. We demonstrate\nthat this combined approach can be employed to map the dependence of the Fermi\nsurface of TMD nanolayers on field-effect doping, detect Lifshitz transitions,\nand provide a method to determine the amount of strain and spin-orbit splitting\nbetween sub-bands from electric transport measurements in real devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Nov 2018 16:41:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Jan 2020 13:44:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-27"}

Such\nactions can either be externally directed, such as opening a door, or\ninternally directed, such as writing data to a memory location or strengthening\na synaptic connection. Some internal actions, to which we refer as\ncomputations, potentially help the agent choose better actions. Considering\nthat (external) actions and computations might draw upon the same resources,\nsuch as time and energy, deciding when to act or compute, as well as what to\ncompute, are detrimental to the performance of an agent.\n  In an environment that provides rewards depending on an agent's behavior, an\naction's value is typically defined as the sum of expected long-term rewards\nsucceeding the action (itself a complex quantity that depends on what the agent\ngoes on to do after the action in question). However, defining the value of a\ncomputation is not as straightforward, as computations are only valuable in a\nhigher order way, through the alteration of actions.\n  This thesis offers a principled way of computing the value of a computation\nin a planning setting formalized as a Markov decision process. We present two\ndifferent definitions of computation values: static and dynamic. They address\ntwo extreme cases of the computation budget: affording calculation of zero or\ninfinitely many steps in the future. We show that these values have desirable\nproperties, such as temporal consistency and asymptotic convergence.\n  Furthermore, we propose methods for efficiently computing and approximating\nthe static and dynamic computation values. We describe a sense in which the\npolicies that greedily maximize these values can be optimal. We utilize these\nprinciples to construct Monte Carlo tree search algorithms that outperform most\nof the state-of-the-art in terms of finding higher quality actions given the\nsame simulation resources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Nov 2018 17:39:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-08"}

Mechanical oscillators, despite\ntheir pervasive presence in nature and modern technology, do not generically\nexist in an excited Fock state. In the past few years, careful isolation of\nGHz-frequency nano-scale oscillators has allowed experimenters to prepare such\nstates at milli-Kelvin temperatures. These developments illustrate the tension\nbetween the basic predictions of quantum mechanics that should apply to all\nmechanical oscillators existing even at ambient conditions, and the complex\nexperiments in extreme conditions required to observe those predictions. We\nresolve the tension by creating a single Fock state of a vibration mode of a\ncrystal at room temperature using a technique that can be applied to any\nRaman-active system. After exciting a bulk diamond with a femtosecond laser\npulse and detecting a Stokes-shifted photon, the 40~THz Raman-active internal\nvibrational mode is prepared in the Fock state $|1>$ with $98.5\\%$ probability.\nThe vibrational state is read out by a subsequent pulse, which when subjected\nto a Hanbury-Brown-Twiss intensity correlation measurement reveals the\nsub-Poisson number statistics of the vibrational mode. By controlling the delay\nbetween the two pulses we are able to witness the decay of the vibrational Fock\nstate over its $3.9$ ps lifetime at room temperature. Our technique is agnostic\nto specific selection rules, and should thus be applicable to any Raman-active\nmedium, opening a new generic approach to the experimental study of quantum\neffects related to vibrational degrees of freedom in molecules and solid-state\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Nov 2018 17:46:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 16 Dec 2018 12:59:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 30 May 2019 13:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 7 Oct 2019 14:45:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-16"}

The most promising explanation for\nthis obesity is that the BH-BH merger occurred at low metallicity (Z): when the\niron (Fe) contents is lower this is expected to result in weaker mass loss\nduring the Wolf-Rayet (WR) phase. We therefore critically evaluate the claims\nfor the reasons of heavy BHs as a function of Z in the literature. Furthermore,\nweaker stellar winds might lead to more rapid stellar rotation, allowing WR and\nBH progenitor evolution in a chemically homogeneous manner. However, there is\nas yet no empirical evidence for more rapid rotation amongst WR stars in the\nlow Z environment of the Magellanic Clouds. Due to the intrinsic challenge of\ndetermining WR rotation rates from emission lines, the most promising avenue to\nconstrain rotation-rate distributions amongst various WR subgroups is through\nthe utilisation of their emission lines in polarised light. We thus provide an\noverview of linear spectro-polarimetry observations of both single and binary\nWRs in the Galaxy, as well as the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, at 50% and\n20% of solar Z, respectively. Initial results suggest that the route of\nchemically homogeneous evolution (CHE) through stellar rotation is challenging,\nwhilst the alternative of a post-LBV or common envelope evolution is more\nlikely.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Nov 2018 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

We\nreport a significant drag increase and an enhancement of the turbulence\nactivity with growing wall elasticity for both single-phase and particulate\ncases in comparison with the single-phase flow over rigid walls. A drag\nreduction and a turbulence attenuation is obtained for the particulate cases\nwith highly elastic walls, albeit with respect to the single-phase flow of the\nsame wall elasticity; whereas, an opposite effect of the particles is observed\non the flow of the less elastic walls. This is explained by investigating the\nnear-wall turbulence of highly elastic walls, where the strong asymmetry in the\nmagnitude of wall-normal velocity fluctuations (favouring the positive), is\nfound to push the particles towards the channel centre. The particle layer\nclose to the wall is shown to contribute to the turbulence production by\nincreasing the wall-normal velocity fluctuations, while in the absence of this\nlayer, smaller wall deformation and in turn a turbulence attenuation is\nobserved. We further address the effect of the volume fraction at a moderate\nwall elasticity, by increasing the particle volume fraction up to 20%.\nMigration of the particles from the interface region is found to be the cause\nof a further turbulence attenuation, in comparison to the same volume fraction\nin the case of rigid walls.

Conventional signal optimization has\nrevealed its limitation in improving the mobility and safety of an\nintersection. Unconventional arterial intersection designs (UAIDs) are able to\nimprove the performance of an intersection by reducing phases of a signal\ncycle. Furthermore, they can fundamentally alter the number and the nature of\nthe conflicting points. However, the driver's confusion, as a result of the\nunconventional geometric designs, remains one of the major barriers for the\nwidespread adoption of UAIDs.

The toroidal field couples the r-modes to\nthe disc's magneto-acoustic response and inflates the effective pressure within\nthe oscillations. As a consequence, the restoring force associated with the\nvertical magnetic field's tension is reduced.

This model was recently introduced in the\ncontext of submodular optimization in [BS18a] to quantify the information\ntheoretic complexity of black-box optimization in a parallel computation model.\nInformally, the adaptivity of an algorithm is the number of sequential rounds\nit makes when each round can execute polynomially-many function evaluations in\nparallel. Since submodular optimization is regularly applied on large datasets\nwe seek algorithms with low adaptivity to enable speedups via parallelization.\nConsequently, a recent line of work has been devoted to designing constant\nfactor approximation algorithms for maximizing submodular functions under\nvarious constraints in the adaptive complexity model [BS18a, BS18b, BBS18,\nBRS19, EN19, FMZ19, CQ19, ENV18, FMZ18].\n  Despite the burst in work on submodular maximization in the adaptive\ncomplexity model the fundamental problem of maximizing a monotone submodular\nfunction under a matroid constraint has remained elusive. In particular, all\nknown techniques fail for this problem and there are no known constant factor\napproximation algorithms whose adaptivity is sublinear in the rank of the\nmatroid $k$ or in the worst case sublinear in the size of the ground set $n$.\n  In this paper we present an approximation algorithm for the problem of\nmaximizing a monotone submodular function under a matroid constraint in the\nadaptive complexity model.

Measuring how the physical properties of galaxies change across\ncosmic times is essential to understand galaxy formation and evolution. With\nthe advent of numerous ground-based and space-borne instruments launched over\nthe past few decades we now have exquisite multi-wavelength observations of\ngalaxies from the FUV to the radio domain. To tap into this mine of data and\nobtain new insight into the formation and evolution of galaxies, it is\nessential that we are able to extract information from their SED. Aims. We\npresent a completely new implementation of CIGALE. Written in python, its main\naims are to easily and efficiently model the FUV to radio spectrum of galaxies\nand estimate their physical properties such as star formation rate,\nattenuation, dust luminosity, stellar mass, and many other physical quantities.\nMethods. To compute the spectral models, CIGALE builds composite stellar\npopulations from simple stellar populations combined with highly flexible star\nformation histories, calculates the emission from gas ionised by massive stars,\nand attenuates both the stars and the ionised gas with a highly flexible\nattenuation curve. Based on an energy balance principle, the absorbed energy is\nthen re-emitted by the dust in the mid- and far-infrared domains while thermal\nand non-thermal components are also included, extending the spectrum far into\nthe radio range. A large grid of models is then fitted to the data and the\nphysical properties are estimated through the analysis of the likelihood\ndistribution. Results. CIGALE is a versatile and easy-to-use tool that makes\nfull use of the architecture of multi-core computers, building grids of\nmillions of models and analysing samples of thousands of galaxies, both at high\nspeed. Beyond fitting the SEDs of galaxies and parameter estimations, it can\nalso be used as a model-generation tool or serve as a library to build new\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Nov 2018 19:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-13"}

On phenomenological grounds, we identify the scaling variables as the\ndensity of thermal regions and the lengthscale that controls the decay of\ntypical matrix elements. Within this KT picture, the MBL phase is a line of\nfixed points that terminates at the delocalization transition. We discuss two\npossible scenarios distinguished by the distribution of rare, fractal thermal\ninclusions within the MBL phase. In the first scenario, these regions have a\nstretched exponential distribution in the MBL phase. In the second scenario,\nthe near-critical MBL phase hosts rare thermal regions that are power-law\ndistributed in size. This points to the existence of a second transition within\nthe MBL phase, at which these power-laws change to the stretched exponential\nform expected at strong disorder.

While crucial,\nthis turns out to be a challenge on multiple fronts. First, multi-wavelength\nspectroscopy is vital. As such systems can be highly absorbed, this is often\nalready hard to accomplish. Secondly, even if the spectroscopic data is\navailable, the determination of reliable stellar parameters requires\nsophisticated model atmospheres that accurately describe the outermost layers\nand the wind of the donor star.\n  For early-type donors, the stellar wind is radiatively driven and there is a\nsmooth transition between the outermost layers of the star and the wind. The\nintricate non-LTE conditions in the winds of hot stars complicate the situation\neven further, as proper model atmospheres need to account for a multitude of\nphysics to accurately provide stellar and wind parameters. The latter are\nespecially crucial for the so-called \"wind-fed\" HXMBs, where the captured wind\nof the supergiant donor is the only source for the material accreted by the\ncompact object.\n  In this review I will address the different approaches for treating stellar\nwinds in the analysis of HMXBs. Fundamentals of stellar atmosphere modeling are\ndiscussed, also addressing the limitations of modern models and examples from\nrecent analysis results for particular HMXBs. Moreover, the path for the next\ngeneration of stellar atmosphere models will be outlined, where models can be\nused not only for measurements, but also to make predictions and provide a\nlaboratory for theoretical conclusions. Stellar atmospheres are a key tool in\nunderstanding HMXBs, e.g. by providing insights about the accretion of stellar\nwinds onto the compact object, or by placing the studied systems in the correct\nevolutionary context in order to identify potential gravitational wave (GW)\nprogenitors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Nov 2018 19:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

Using the NIR, we find the nucleus to be\ndominated by old stellar populations, and a circumnuclear ring with younger\n($\\sim$2.5Gyr) stars. We also combined the optical and NIR datacubes and\nperformed a panchromatic spatially resolved stellar population synthesis, which\nresulted in a dominance of older stellar populations, in agreement with optical\nresults. We argue that the technique of combining optical and NIR data might be\nuseful to isolate the contribution of stellar population ages with strong NIR\nabsorption bands. We also derive the stellar kinematics and find that the\nstellar motions are dominated by a high ($\\sim$240km$\\cdot$s$^{-1}$) velocity\ndispersion in the nucleus, with stars also rotating around the center. Lastly,\nwe measure the absorption bands, both in the optical and in the NIR, and find a\nnuclear drop in their equivalent widths. The favored explanation for this drop\nis a featureless continuum emission from the low luminosity active galactic\nnucleus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Nov 2018 19:25:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-28"}

Hence, by controlling the axis distribution, it is possible to\neither promote or hinder the yield of products into specific final states or\nscattering angles. This idea has been successfully implemented in experiments\nby polarizing the internuclear axis before the reaction takes place, either by\nmanipulating the rotational angular distribution or by Stark effect in the\npresence of an orienting field. When there is a dominant reaction mechanism,\ncharacterized by a set of impact parameters and angles of attack, it is\nexpected that a preparation that helps the system to reach the transition state\nassociated with that mechanism will promote the reaction, whilst a different\npreparation would generally impair the reaction. However, when two or more\ncompeting mechanisms via interference contribute to the reaction into specific\nscattering angles and final states, it is not evident which would be the effect\nof changing the axis preparation. To address this problem, throughout this\narticle we have simulated the effect that different experimental preparations\nhave on the DCSs for the H + D2 reaction at relatively high energies, for which\nit has been shown that several competing mechanisms give rise to interference\nthat shapes the DCS. To this aim, we have extended the formulation of the\npolarization dependent DCS to calculate polarization dependent generalized\ndeflection functions of ranks greater than zero. Our results show that\ninterference are very sensitive to changes in the internuclear axis\npreparation, and that the shape of the DCS can be controlled exquisitely.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Nov 2018 19:30:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-24"}

This paper concerns the best\nconstrained approximation of a non-linear operator in probability spaces. We\npropose and justify a new approach and technique based on the following\nobservation. Methods for best approximation are aimed at obtaining the best\nsolution within a certain class; the accuracy of the solution is limited by the\nextent to which the class is suitable.\n  By contrast, iterative methods are normally convergent but the convergence\ncan be quite slow.

We compare the behavior of each group of\nstate-sponsored trolls with a focus on how their strategies change over time,\nthe different campaigns they embark on, and differences between the trolls\noperated by Russia and Iran.

While averages performed on large scales tend to zero because of\nthe oscillatory character, those performed on increasingly smaller scales will\nvary with the averaging scale in some characteristic way. This characteristic\nvariation at high Reynolds numbers is captured by the so-called cancellation\nexponent, which measures how local averages tend to cancel out as the averaging\nscale increases, in space or time. Past experimental work suggests that the\nexponents in turbulence depend on whether one considers quantities in full\nthree-dimensional space or uses their one- or two-dimensional cuts.

The retrieval of line-of-sight\ncomponent of the chromospheric magnetic field from the core of the spectral\nline is reliable for field strengths up to ~1200 G, even when moderate velocity\ngradients are present. The horizontal component, on the other hand, is suitably\nderived using the wing-core boundary of the spectral line, but typically yields\nsystematic errors of >10%.

A sparse graph is first created using Delaunay\ntriangulation from all map points. In this graph, the vertices represent map\npoints, and each edge represents the correlation between adjacent points. If\nthe relative position between two points remains consistent over time, there is\ncorrelation between them, and they are considered to be moving together\nrigidly.

After the edges between the uncorrelated points are removed\nduring point-correlation optimization, the remaining graph separates the map\npoints of the moving objects from the map points of the static scene.

To address\nthese issues, we propose a blockchain based privacy-preserving data sharing for\nEMRs, called BPDS. In BPDS, the original EMRs are stored securely in the cloud\nand the indexes are reserved in a tamper-proof consortium blockchain. By this\nmeans, the risk of the medical data leakage could be greatly reduced, and at\nthe same time, the indexes in blockchain ensure that the EMRs can not be\nmodified arbitrarily. Secure data sharing can be accomplished automatically\naccording to the predefined access permissions of patients through the smart\ncontracts of blockchain.

We combine the l1-norm and\nl2-norm based regularizations in one Huber-type loss function, and then\nformulate an optimization problem in the Fourier Domain for fast computation,\nwhich enables the tracker to adaptively ignore the noisy features produced from\nocclusion and illumination variation, while keep the advantages of l2-norm\nbased regression.

Ontology is commonly used as a structure that captures the\nknowledge about a certain area via providing concepts and relations between\nthem. Traditionally, concept hierarchies have been built manually by knowledge\nengineers or domain experts. However, the manual construction of a concept\nhierarchy suffers from several limitations such as its coverage and the\nenormous costs of its extension and maintenance. Ontology learning, usually\nreferred to the (semi-)automatic support in ontology development, is usually\ndivided into steps, going from concepts identification, passing through\nhierarchy and non-hierarchy relations detection and, seldom, axiom extraction.\nIt is reasonable to say that among these steps the current frontier is in the\nestablishment of concept hierarchies, since this is the backbone of ontologies\nand, therefore, a good concept hierarchy is already a valuable resource for\nmany ontology applications. The automatic construction of concept hierarchies\nfrom texts is a complex task and much work have been proposing approaches to\nbetter extract relations between concepts. These different proposals have never\nbeen contrasted against each other on the same set of data and across different\nlanguages. Such comparison is important to see whether they are complementary\nor incremental. Also, we can see whether they present different tendencies\ntowards recall and precision.

This simple average pooling,\nhowever, is inherently sensitive to the phonetic content of the utterance. An\ninteresting idea borrowed from machine translation is the attention-based\nmechanism, where the contribution of an input word to the translation at a\nparticular time is weighted by an attention score.

In the polaron\npicture, the coupling in the two-photon process leads to spin-related asymmetry\nso that the original single bosonic mode splits into two separated frequency\nmodes for the opposite spins, which correspond to two \\textit{bare} polarons.\nFurthermore, the tunneling causes these two bare polarons to exchange their\ncomponents with each other, thus leading to additional \\textit{induced}\npolarons. According to this picture, the variational ground-state wave function\nof the two-photon QRM can be correctly constructed, with the ground-state\nenergy and other physical observables in good agreement with the exact numerics\nin all the coupling regimes. Furthermore, generalization to multiple induced\npolarons involving higher orders in the tunneling effect provides a systematic\nway to yield a rapid convergence in accuracy even around the difficult spectral\ncollapse point.

In this paper, we present YODA, which is to the best of our\nknowledge the first solution for efficient computation of CICs in\npermissionless blockchains with guarantees for a threat model with both\nByzantine and selfish nodes. YODA selects one or more execution sets (ES) via\nSortition to execute a particular CIC off-chain. One key innovation is the\nMultI-Round Adaptive Consensus using Likelihood Estimation (MIRACLE) algorithm\nbased on sequential hypothesis testing. M I RACLE allows the execution sets to\nbe small thus making YODA efficient while ensuring correct CIC execution with\nhigh probability. It adapts the number of ES sets automatically depending on\nthe concentration of Byzantine nodes in the system and is optimal in terms of\nthe expected number of ES sets used in certain scenarios. Through a suite of\neconomic incentives and technical mechanisms such as the novel Randomness\nInserted Contract Execution (RICE) algorithm, we force selfish nodes to behave\nhonestly. We also prove that the honest behavior of selfish nodes is an\napproximate Nash Equilibrium. We present the system design and details of YODA\nand prove the security properties of MIRACLE and RICE.

When wildfires become uncontrollable, Incident Manager Teams\n(IMT's) dispatch response vehicles to key assets to undertake protective tasks\nand so mitigate the risk to these assets. In developing a deployment plan under\nsevere time pressure, IMT's need to consider the special requirements of each\nasset, the resources (vehicles and their teams), as well as uncertainties\nassociated with the wildfire. A common situation that arises in southern\nAustralian wildfires is a wind change. There is a reliable forecast of a wind\nchange, but some uncertainty around the timing of that change. To assist IMT's\nto deal with this situation we develop a two-stage stochastic model to\nintegrate such an uncertainty with the complexities of asset protection\noperations.

Examples of\nthe loss of physical stability include the Northeast blackout of 2003 in North\nAmerica and the 2015 system-wide blackout in Ukraine. The nonlinear hybrid\nnature, that is, nonlinear continuous dynamics integrated with discrete\nswitching, and the high degree of freedom property of power system dynamics\nmake it challenging to conduct the dynamic security analysis. In this paper, we\nuse the hybrid automaton model to describe the dynamics of a power system and\nmainly deal with the index-1 differential-algebraic equation models regarding\nthe continuous dynamics in different discrete states. The analysis problem is\nformulated as a reachability problem of the associated hybrid model.

When compared to obstacle\navoidance in ground vehicular robots, UAV navigation brings in additional\nchallenges because the UAV motion is no more constrained to a well-defined\nindoor ground or street environment. Horizontal structures in indoor and\noutdoor environments like decorative items, furnishings, ceiling fans,\nsign-boards, tree branches etc., also become relevant obstacles unlike those\nfor ground vehicular robots. Thus, methods of obstacle avoidance developed for\nground robots are clearly inadequate for UAV navigation. Current control\nmethods using monocular images for UAV obstacle avoidance are heavily dependent\non environment information. These controllers do not fully retain and utilize\nthe extensively available information about the ambient environment for\ndecision making.

The crucial idea in our method is the concept of partial\nobservability and how UAVs can retain relevant information about the\nenvironment structure to make better future navigation decisions. Our OA\ntechnique uses recurrent neural networks with temporal attention and provides\nbetter results compared to prior works in terms of distance covered during\nnavigation without collisions.

The pipeline package enables end-to-end\ndata reduction of pupil-stabilized data and supports classical dithering and\ncoronagraphic data sets. As an example, we processed archival VLT/NACO L' and\nM' data of beta Pic b and reassessed the planet's brightness and position with\nan MCMC analysis, and we provide a derivation of the photometric error budget.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Nov 2018 09:57:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Jan 2019 11:21:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-25"}

The problem admits\n$(1+o(1))$-approximation $\\tilde\\Theta(n)$-time algorithm and a nearly-tight\n$\\tilde \\Omega(n)$ lower bound [Nanongkai, STOC'14; Lenzen and Patt-Shamir\nPODC'15]\\footnote{$\\tilde \\Theta$, $\\tilde O$ and $\\tilde \\Omega$ hide\npolylogarithmic factors.

For example, online social platforms allow for seamless\ncommunication exchanges at an unprecedented scale. However, we are still\nbounded by cognitive and temporal constraints. Our attention is limited and\nextremely valuable. Algorithmic personalisation has become a standard approach\nto tackle the information overload problem. As result, the exposure to our\nfriends' opinions and our perception about important issues might be distorted.\nHowever, the effects of algorithmic gatekeeping on our hyper-connected society\nare poorly understood. Here, we devise an opinion dynamics model where\nindividuals are connected through a social network and adopt opinions as\nfunction of the view points they are exposed to. We apply various filtering\nalgorithms that select the opinions shown to users i) at random ii) considering\ntime ordering or iii) their current beliefs. Furthermore, we investigate the\ninterplay between such mechanisms and crucial features of real networks. We\nfound that algorithmic filtering might influence opinions' share and\ndistributions, especially in case information is biased towards the current\nopinion of each user. These effects are reinforced in networks featuring\ntopological and spatial correlations where echo chambers and polarisation\nemerge. Conversely, heterogeneity in connectivity patterns reduces such\ntendency. We consider also a scenario where one opinion, through nudging, is\ncentrally pushed to all users. Interestingly, even minimal nudging is able to\nchange the status quo moving it towards the desired view point. Our findings\nsuggest that simple filtering algorithms might be powerful tools to regulate\nopinion dynamics taking place on social networks\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Nov 2018 10:19:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-09"}

The theory is developed in three steps. First, the paper\nintroduces a graded generalization of the two key notions underpinning Dung's\nsemantics: self-defense and conflict-freeness. This leads to a natural\ngeneralization of Dung's semantics, whereby standard extensions are weakened or\nstrengthened depending on the level of self-defense and conflict-freeness they\nmeet. The paper investigates the fixpoint theory of these semantics,\nestablishing existence results for them. Second, the paper shows how graded\nsemantics readily provide an approach to argument rankings, offering a novel\ncontribution to the recently growing research programme on ranking-based\nsemantics. Third, this novel approach to argument ranking is applied and\nstudied in the context of instantiated argumentation frameworks, and in so\ndoing is shown to account for a simple form of accrual of arguments within the\nDung paradigm.

Often machine learning based\napproaches serve as basis for surgical workflow analysis. In general machine\nlearning algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), require large\namounts of labeled data. While data is often available in abundance, many tasks\nin surgical workflow analysis need data annotated by domain experts, making it\ndifficult to obtain a sufficient amount of annotations.\n  The aim of using active learning to train a machine learning model is to\nreduce the annotation effort. Active learning methods determine which unlabeled\ndata points would provide the most information according to some metric, such\nas prediction uncertainty.

A context-aware\nmethod that analyses the workflow of an intervention online and automatically\npredicts the remaining duration would alleviate these problems. As basis for\nsuch an estimate, information regarding the current state of the intervention\nis required. Methods Today, the operating room contains a diverse range of\nsensors. During laparoscopic interventions, the endoscopic video stream is an\nideal source of such information. Extracting quantitative information from the\nvideo is challenging though, due to its high dimensionality. Other surgical\ndevices (e.g. insufflator, lights, etc.) provide data streams which are, in\ncontrast to the video stream, more compact and easier to quantify. Though\nwhether such streams offer sufficient information for estimating the duration\nof surgery is uncertain.

Traditionally, data representations were hand-crafted.\nRecently it has been demonstrated that, given sufficient data, deep neural\nnetworks can learn effective implicit representations from simple input\nrepresentations. However, for most scientific problems, the use of deep\nlearning is not appropriate as the amount of available data is limited, and/or\nthe output models must be explainable. Nevertheless, many scientific problems\ndo have significant amounts of data available on related tasks, which makes\nthem amenable to multi-task learning, i.e. learning many related problems\nsimultaneously. Here we propose a novel and general representation learning\napproach for multi-task learning that works successfully with small amounts of\ndata. The fundamental new idea is to transform an input intrinsic data\nrepresentation (i.e., handcrafted features), to an extrinsic representation\nbased on what a pre-trained set of models predict about the examples. This\ntransformation has the dual advantages of producing significantly more accurate\npredictions, and providing explainable models. To demonstrate the utility of\nthis transformative learning approach, we have applied it to three real-world\nscientific problems: drug-design (quantitative structure activity relationship\nlearning), predicting human gene expression (across different tissue types and\ndrug treatments), and meta-learning for machine learning (predicting which\nmachine learning methods work best for a given problem). In all three problems,\ntransformative machine learning significantly outperforms the best intrinsic\nrepresentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Nov 2018 13:09:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-09"}

This formulation is based on a stationary\nMarkov chain representation of link connectivity. The existence of a link\nbetween two nodes depends on their distance, which is governed by the mobility\nmodel. In our analysis, nodes move randomly according to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck\nprocess using one tuning parameter to obtain different levels of randomness in\nthe mobility pattern. Finally, we propose an entropy-rate-based metric that\nquantifies link uncertainty and evaluates its stability. Numerical results show\nthat the proposed approach can accurately reflect the random mobility in the\nnetwork and fully captures the link dynamics. It may thus be considered a\nvaluable performance metric for the evaluation of the link stability and\nconnectivity in these networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Nov 2018 14:02:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-09"}

The concentrations\nof the cosmogenic isotopes 14C and 10Be in natural archives have been converted\nto decadally averaged sunspot numbers through a chain of physics-based models.\nTSI and SSI are reconstructed with an updated SATIRE model.

Based on our\nrecently predicted single-layer pentagonal CoS$_2$ that is an antiferromagnetic\n(AFM) semiconductor, we replace two S atoms by As atoms in a unit cell to form\nsingle-layer pentagonal CoAsS. The resulting single-layer material is\ndynamically stable ac-cording to the phonon calculations. We find two drastic\nchanges in the properties of single-layer pentagonal CoAsS in comparison with\nthose of CoS$_2$. First, we find a magnetic transition from the AFM to FM\nordering. We understand that the transition is caused by the lower\nelectronegativity of As atoms, leading to the weakened bridging roles on the\nsuperexchange interactions be-tween Co ions. Single-layer pentagonal CoAsS also\nshows significantly stronger magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy due to\nstronger spin-orbit coupling. We additionally perform Monte Carlo simulations\nto calculate the Curie temperature of single-layer pentagonal CoAsS and the\npredicted Curie temperature is 103 K. Second, we find that single-layer\npentagonal CoAsS exhibits piezoelectricity, which is absent in single-layer\npentagonal CoS$_2$ due to its center of symmetry. The computed piezoelectric\ncoefficients are also sizable. The rare coexistence of FM ordering and\npiezoelectric properties makes single-layer pentagonal CoAsS a promising\nmultifunctional 2D material.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Nov 2018 14:48:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-11"}

Aims: We study the impact on the abundances of the species simulated\nby the chemical codes by considering the uncertainties in the diffusion energy\nof adsorbed species. We aim to limit the uncertainties in the abundances as\ncalculated by chemical codes by identifying the surface species that result in\na larger error because of the uncertainties in their diffusion energy. Methods:\nWe ran various cases with 2000 to 10000 simulations in each case and varied the\ndiffusion energies of some or all surface species randomly. We calculated\nPearson correlation coefficients between the abundances and the ratio of\ndiffusion to binding energy of adsorbed species.

A key component behind\nthe success of recent approaches is the self-consistency loss, which encourages\na network to recover the original input image when the output generated for a\ndesired attribute is itself passed through the same network, but with the\ntarget attribute inverted. While the self-consistency loss yields\nphoto-realistic results, it can be shown that the input and target domains,\nsupposed to be close, differ substantially. This is empirically found by\nobserving that a network recovers the input image even if attributes other than\nthe inversion of the original goal are set as target. This stops one combining\nnetworks for different tasks, or using a network to do progressive forward\npasses.

Recently, a range of approaches based on graph kernels or graph\nneural networks have been developed for graph classification and for\nrepresentation learning on graphs in general.

Its performance on classifying attributed graphs is\nslightly weaker as it does not incorporate attributes. However, given its\nsimplicity and efficiency, we believe that it still serves as an effective\nbaseline for attributed graph classification.

The goal\nis to reconstruct $X$ with probability of error bounded away from $1/2$ using\nthe values of all vertices at an arbitrarily deep layer. This question is\nclosely related to models of reliable computation and storage, and information\nflow in biological networks.\n  In this paper, we analyze randomly constructed DAGs, for which we show that\nbroadcasting is only possible if the noise level is below a certain degree and\nfunction dependent critical threshold. For $d\\geq 3$, and random DAGs with\nlayer sizes $\\Omega(\\log k)$ and majority processing functions, we identify the\ncritical threshold. For $d=2$, we establish a similar result for NAND\nprocessing functions. We also prove a partial converse for odd $d\\geq 3$\nillustrating that the identified thresholds are impossible to improve by\nselecting different processing functions if the decoder is restricted to using\na single vertex.\n  Finally, for any noise level, we construct explicit DAGs (using expander\ngraphs) with bounded degree and layer sizes $\\Theta(\\log k)$ admitting\nreconstruction. In particular, we show that such DAGs can be generated in\ndeterministic quasi-polynomial time or randomized polylogarithmic time in the\ndepth. These results portray a doubly-exponential advantage for storing a bit\nin DAGs compared to trees, where $d=1$ but layer sizes must grow exponentially\nwith depth in order to enable broadcasting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Nov 2018 22:26:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 May 2019 10:37:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 9 Mar 2020 05:09:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-11"}

Unfortunately, the accuracy of the pulsar timing is\nseriously affected by the spin-down irregularities, such as spin fluctuations\nwith a manifestation of low frequency structures (the so-called red noise\nprocesses), and various activities of magnetospheres. Except from the random\ntiming noise, significant periodic or quasi-periodic components could also be\nfound in some timing residuals of pulsars, indicating the presence of\nunmodelled deterministic effects. The physical origins of these effects still\nremain unexplained. In this paper, we suggest a new mechanism involving the de\nHaas-van Alphen magnetic oscillation, which could trigger the observed low\nfrequency structures. We find that the proposed magnetic oscillation period is\nabout 1-$10^{2}$ yr, which is about $10^{-4}$ times as long as the classical\ncharacteristic time scale of interior magnetic field evolution for a normal\nneutron star. Due to the magnetic oscillation, we estimate both the braking\nindex range between $10^{-5}$ and $10^{5}$ and the residuals range between 4 to\n906 ms for some specific samples of quasi-periodic pulsars.

To model an isolated Universe, we use the Wheeler-DeWitt\nequation and then apply the Page-Wootters method of recovering time. It is\nargued that, if the recovery of an experience of time is indeed viable in this\nframework, interactions and quantum entanglement are both essential features,\neven though the former is normally an afterthought or altogether dismissed. As\nfor the one-way arrow of time, this is, from our perspective, a consequence of\nincluding the aforementioned interactions. But underlying our interpretation,\nand pretty much all others, is the necessity for causality. It is this\nfundamental tenet which accounts for our experience of time but yet can only be\npostulated.

As set-point viral load distributions can differ\nsignificantly amongst epidemics, it is imperative to account for the observed\nlocal variation. This can be done by using a heritability model and fitting it\nto a local set-point viral load distribution. However, as the fitting procedure\nneeds to take into account the actual transmission dynamics (i.e., social\nnetwork, sexual behaviour), a complex model is required. Furthermore, in order\nto use the estimates in subsequent modelling analyses to inform prevention\npolicies, it is important to assess parameter robustness.\n  In order to fit set-point viral load models without the need to capture\nexplicitly the transmission dynamics, we present a new protocol. Firstly, we\napproximate the transmission network from a phylogeny that was inferred from\nsequences collected in the local epidemic. Secondly, as this transmission\nnetwork only comprises a single instance of the transmission network space, and\nour aim is to assess parameter robustness, we infer the transmission network\ndistribution. Thirdly, we fit the parameters of the selected set-point viral\nload model on multiple samples from the transmission network distribution using\napproximate Bayesian inference.\n  Our new protocol enables researchers to fit set-point viral load models in\ntheir local context, and diagnose the model parameter's uncertainty. Such\nparameter estimates are essential to enable subsequent modelling analyses, and\nthus crucial to improve prevention policies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Nov 2018 13:41:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-28"}
