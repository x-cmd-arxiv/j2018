A new exact analytical method\nand a new numerical method of converting Cartesian to ellipsoidal coordinates\nof a point on a triaxial ellipsoid are presented. An extensive test set for the\ncoordinate conversion is used, in order to evaluate the performance of the two\nmethods. The direct geodesic problem on a triaxial ellipsoid is described as an\ninitial value problem and is solved numerically in Cartesian coordinates. The\nsolution provides the Cartesian coordinates and the angle between the line of\nconstant {\\lambda} and the geodesic, at any point along the geodesic. Also, the\nLiouville constant is computed at any point along the geodesic, allowing to\ncheck the precision of the method. An extensive data set of geodesics is used,\nin order to demonstrate the validity of the numerical method for the geodesic\nproblem. We conclude that a complete, stable and precise solution of the\nproblem is accomplished.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Nov 2018 16:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-09"}

Their dissolution or growth dynamics is complex.\nDifferences in solubility between the drop components combined with the solutal\nMarangoni effect and natural convections contribute to this complexity, which\ncan be even further increased in combination with the ouzo effect, i.e., the\nspontaneous nucleation of microdroplets due to composition-dependent\nmiscibilities in a ternary system. The quantitive understanding of this\ncombined process is important for applications in industry, particularly for\nmodern liquid-liquid microextraction processes. In this work, as a model\nsystem, we experimentally and theoretically explore water/ethanol drops\ndissolving in anethole oil. During the dissolution, we observed two types of\nmicrodroplets nucleation, namely water microdroplet nucleation in the\nsurrounding oil at drop midheight and oil microdroplet nucleation in the\naqueous drop, again at midheight. The nucleated oil microdroplets are driven by\nMarangoni flows inside the aqueous drop and evolve into microdroplets rings. A\none-dimensional multiphase and multicomponent diffusion model in combination\nwith thermodynamical equilibrium theory is proposed to predict the behavior of\nspontaneous emulsification, i.e. the microdroplet nucleation, that is triggered\nby diffusion. A scale analysis together with experimental investigations of the\nfluid dynamics of the system reveals that both the solutal Marangoni flow\ninside the drop and the buoyancy-driven flow in the host liquid influence the\ndiffusion-triggered emulsification process.

Transactions in barter exchanges\nare often facilitated via a central clearinghouse that must match participants\neven in the face of uncertainty---over participants, existence and quality of\npotential trades, and so on. Leveraging robust combinatorial optimization\ntechniques, we address uncertainty in kidney exchange, a real-world barter\nmarket where patients swap (in)compatible paired donors. We provide two\nscalable robust methods to handle two distinct types of uncertainty in kidney\nexchange---over the quality and the existence of a potential match. The latter\ncase directly addresses a weakness in all stochastic-optimization-based methods\nto the kidney exchange clearing problem, which all necessarily require explicit\nestimates of the probability of a transaction existing---a still-unsolved\nproblem in this nascent market. We also propose a novel, scalable kidney\nexchange formulation that eliminates the need for an exponential-time\nconstraint generation process in competing formulations, maintains provable\noptimality, and serves as a subsolver for our robust approach. For each type of\nuncertainty we demonstrate the benefits of robustness on real data from a\nlarge, fielded kidney exchange in the United States. We conclude by drawing\nparallels between robustness and notions of fairness in the kidney exchange\nsetting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Nov 2018 16:25:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-09"}

However, such mechanisms require significant\nresources, which prevents their continuous use in resource-constrained\ncyber-physical systems. Recently, it was shown how physical properties of\nplants can be exploited to relax these requirements for systems where sensor\nmeasurements and actuator commands are transmitted over a compromised network;\nspecifically, intermittent use of data authentication, can still provide\nQuality-of-Control (QoC) guarantees even in the presence of false-data\ninjection attacks. Consequently, in this work we focus on integrating security\ninto existing systems, in order to protect against these attacks. We introduce\na design-time methodology that incorporates requirements for QoC in the\npresence of attacks into end-to-end timing constraints for real-time control\ntransactions, which include data acquisition and authentication, communication,\nand control. This allows us to formulate a mixed integer linear\nprogramming-based method for synthesis of schedulable task and message\nparameters (i.e., deadlines and offsets) that maintain timing requirements of\ndeployed controllers, while adding a sufficient level of protection against\nattacks; specifically, this method provides suitable intermittent\nauthentication policies that ensure the desired QoC levels under attack. To\nadditionally reduce the security-related bandwidth overhead, we propose the use\nof cumulative message authentication. Furthermore, we introduce a method for\nopportunistic use of remaining resources to further improve the overall QoC\nguarantees while ensuring system schedulability. Finally, we demonstrate\napplicability of our methodology on synthetic automotive systems as well as an\nautomotive case-study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Nov 2018 16:34:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-09"}

In\nparticular, Erd\\H{o}s asked if the moduli can be distinct and all arbitrarily\nlarge, Erd\\H{o}s and Selfridge asked if the moduli can be distinct and all odd,\nand Schinzel conjectured that in any covering system there exists a pair of\nmoduli, one of which divides the other.\n  Another beautiful conjecture, proposed by Erd\\H{o}s and Graham in 1980,\nstates that if the moduli are distinct elements of the interval $[n,Cn]$, and\n$n$ is sufficiently large, then the density of integers uncovered by the union\nis bounded below by a constant (depending only on $C$). This conjecture was\nconfirmed (in a strong form) by Filaseta, Ford, Konyagin, Pomerance and Yu in\n2007, who moreover asked whether the same conclusion holds if the moduli are\ndistinct and sufficiently large, and $\\sum_{i=1}^k \\frac{1}{d_i} < C$.

We modify existing retrieval models\nbased on this constraint so that if the order of a pair of query terms is\nsemantically important, a document that includes these query terms in the same\norder as the query should receive a higher score compared to a document that\nincludes them in the reverse order. Our empirical evaluation using both TREC\nnewswire and web corpora demonstrates that the modified retrieval models\nsignificantly outperform their original counterparts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Nov 2018 17:48:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-09"}

Through a cross comparative analysis between the four disaster\ninstances, we find that in contrast with the assumed complexity of evacuation\ndecision making mechanisms in crisis situations, the individuals' evacuation\nprobability is strongly dependent on the seismic intensity that they\nexperience.

Moreover, we\nintroduce an enhancement of this technique, called bisimulation up-to\nsubstitutions, and show how to combine it with other up-to techniques to obtain\na powerful method for proving equivalence of open terms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Nov 2018 18:40:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Feb 2019 15:13:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-13"}

This process can repeat several times and lead to\nsignificant mass growth. In this paper, we calculate the mass of the largest BH\nthat can be formed through repeated mergers of stellar seed BHs and determine\nhow its value depends on the physical properties of the host cluster. We adopt\nan analytical model in which the energy generated by the black hole binaries in\nthe cluster core is assumed to be regulated by the process of two-body\nrelaxation in the bulk of the system. This principle is used to compute the\nhardening rate of the binaries and to relate this to the time-dependent global\nproperties of the parent cluster.

However, observational support for this\nhypothesis is mixed, with some studies showing a correlation between merging\ngalaxies and luminous quasars and others showing no such association. Recent\nobservations have shown that a black hole is likely to become heavily obscured\nbehind merger-driven gas and dust, even in the early stages of the merger, when\nthe galaxies are well separated (5 to 40 kiloparsecs). Merger simulations\nfurther suggest that such obscuration and black-hole accretion peaks in the\nfinal merger stage, when the two galactic nuclei are closely separated (less\nthan 3 kiloparsecs). Resolving this final stage requires a combination of\nhigh-spatial-resolution infrared imaging and high-sensitivity hard-X-ray\nobservations to detect highly obscured sources. However, large numbers of\nobscured luminous accreting supermassive black holes have been recently\ndetected nearby (distances below 250 megaparsecs) in X-ray observations. Here\nwe report high-resolution infrared observations of hard-X-ray-selected black\nholes and the discovery of obscured nuclear mergers, the parent populations of\nsupermassive-black-hole mergers. We find that obscured luminous black holes\n(bolometric luminosity higher than 2x10^44 ergs per second) show a significant\n(P<0.001) excess of late-stage nuclear mergers (17.6 per cent) compared to a\nsample of inactive galaxies with matching stellar masses and star formation\nrates (1.1 per cent), in agreement with theoretical predictions. Using\nhydrodynamic simulations, we confirm that the excess of nuclear mergers is\nindeed strongest for gas-rich major-merger hosts of obscured luminous black\nholes in this final stage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Nov 2018 19:02:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-12"}

As current RT is a static process, where beam intensities\nare calculated before the start of treatment, anatomical deviations can result\nin poor dose conformity. To overcome these limitations, we present a simulation\nstudy on a fully dynamic real-time adaptive radiation therapy (RT-ART)\noptimization approach that uses ultra-fast beamlet control to dynamically adapt\nto patient motion in real-time.\n  A virtual RT-ART machine was simulated with a rapidly rotating linear\naccelerator (LINAC) source (60 RPM) and a binary 1D multi-leaf collimator (MLC)\noperating at 100 Hz. If the real-time tracked target motion exceeded a\npredefined threshold, a time dependent objective function was solved using fast\noptimization methods to calculate new beamlet intensities that were then\ndelivered to the patient.\n  To evaluate the approach, system response was analyzed for patient derived\ncontinuous drift, step-like, and periodic intra-fractional motion.

In all cases, isodose lines and dose-volume-histograms (DVH) showed\nthat RT-ART plan quality was approximately the same as the static case, and\nconsiderably better than the no RT-ART case.\n  The RT-ART optimization framework has the potential to optimally deliver dose\nto a patient in a way that fully accounts for anatomical changes due to motion.\nWith continued advances in real-time patient motion tracking and fast\ncomputational processes, there is significant potential for the RT-ART\noptimization process to be realized on next generation RT machines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Nov 2018 20:10:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Mar 2019 18:18:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 1 Sep 2019 17:59:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

It is shown that massive star-forming galaxies (above\n10^10 Msun) have dust corrections that are dependent on their inclination to\nthe line-of-sight. Edge-on galaxies have higher A_UV and infrared excess\n(IRX=L(IR)/L(UV)) than face-on galaxies at a given beta. Interestingly, dust\ncorrections for low-mass star-forming galaxies do not depend on inclination.\nThis is likely because more massive galaxies have more disk-like\nshapes/kinematics, while low-mass galaxies are more prolate and have more\ndisturbed kinematics. To account for an inclination-dependent dust correction,\na modified Meurer's Relation is derived: A_UV=4.43+1.99 beta - 1.73 (b/a-0.67),\nwhere b/a is the galaxy axis ratio. This inclination-dependence of A_UV can be\nexplained by a two-component model of the dust distribution inside galaxies.

Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) algorithms have shown promise for\nhelping radiologists detect fractures, but the image features underpinning\ntheir predictions are notoriously difficult to understand. In this study, we\ntrained deep learning models on 17,587 radiographs to classify fracture, five\npatient traits, and 14 hospital process variables. All 20 variables could be\npredicted from a radiograph (p < 0.05), with the best performances on scanner\nmodel (AUC=1.00), scanner brand (AUC=0.98), and whether the order was marked\n\"priority\" (AUC=0.79). Fracture was predicted moderately well from the image\n(AUC=0.78) and better when combining image features with patient data\n(AUC=0.86, p=2e-9) or patient data plus hospital process features (AUC=0.91,\np=1e-21). The model performance on a test set with matched patient variables\nwas significantly lower than a random test set (AUC=0.67, p=0.003); and when\nthe test set was matched on patient and image acquisition variables, the model\nperformed randomly (AUC=0.52, 95% CI 0.46-0.58), indicating that these\nvariables were the main source of the model's predictive ability overall. We\nalso used Naive Bayes to combine evidence from image models with patient and\nhospital data and found their inclusion improved performance, but that this\napproach was nevertheless inferior to directly modeling all variables. If CAD\nalgorithms are inexplicably leveraging patient and process variables in their\npredictions, it is unclear how radiologists should interpret their predictions\nin the context of other known patient data. Further research is needed to\nilluminate deep learning decision processes so that computers and clinicians\ncan effectively cooperate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Nov 2018 22:23:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-12"}

A liquid-jet model and\na gas-jet model are also intro-duced to improve grid-independency.

These new paths can be used to avoid\ncongestion, censors, geo-political boundaries, or any feature of the topology\nwhich can be expressed at an AS-level.

In general,\nthere are two types of contacts: close ones among friends, colleagues and\nfamily members, etc., and ordinary contacts from encounters with strangers.\nTypically, social reinforcement occurs for close contacts. Taking into account\nboth types of contacts, we develop a contact-based model for social contagion.\nWe find that, associated with the spreading dynamics, for random networks there\nis coexistence of continuous and discontinuous phase transitions, but for\nheterogeneous networks the transition is continuous. We also find that ordinary\ncontacts play a crucial role in promoting large scale spreading, and the number\nof close contacts determines not only the nature of the phase transitions but\nalso the value of the outbreak threshold in random networks. For heterogeneous\nnetworks from the real world, the abundance of close contacts affects the\nepidemic threshold, while its role in facilitating the spreading depends on the\nadoption threshold assigned to it. We uncover two striking phenomena. First, a\nstrong interplay between ordinary and close contacts is necessary for\ngenerating prevalent spreading. In fact, only when there are propagation paths\nof reasonable length which involve both close and ordinary contacts are large\nscale outbreaks of social contagions possible. Second, abundant close contacts\nin heterogeneous networks promote both outbreak and spreading of the contagion\nthrough the transmission channels among the hubs, when both values of the\nthreshold and transmission rate among ordinary contacts are small.

Since real evasion data are scarce,\nwe first propose EMERAL (Evasion via Maximum Entropy and Rating sAmpLing) to\ngenerate evasive spams to certain existing detectors. EMERAL can simulate\nspammers with different goals and levels of knowledge about the detectors,\ntargeting at different stages of the life cycle of target products.

We develop an efficient numerical framework\nthat can be used to investigate how the macroscopic response of multiple\nfrictional contacts depends on long-range elastic interactions, different\nconstitutive assumptions about the deforming contacts and their local shear\nresistance, and surface roughness. We approximate the contact between two rough\nsurfaces as that between a regular array of discrete deformable elements\nattached to a elastic block and a rigid rough surface. The deformable elements\nare viscoelastic or elasto/viscoplastic with a range of relaxation times, and\nthe elastic interaction between contacts is long-range. We find that the model\nreproduces main macroscopic features of evolution of contact and friction for a\nrange of constitutive models of the elements, suggesting that macroscopic\nfrictional response is robust with respect to the microscopic behavior.\nViscoelasticity/viscoplasticity contributes to the increase of friction with\ncontact time and leads to a subtle history dependence. Interestingly,\nlong-range elastic interactions only change the results quantitatively compared\nto the meanfield response. We find that sustained increase in the static\nfriction coefficient during long hold times suggests viscoelastic response of\nthe underlying material with multiple relaxation time scales.

As opposed to the weak Stackelberg equilibrium\n(WSE), the SSE assumes that the follower breaks ties in favor of the leader and\nthis is widely acknowledged and justified by the assertion that the defender\ncan often induce the attacker to choose a preferred action by making an\ninfinitesimal adjustment to her strategy. Unfortunately, in security games with\nresource assignment constraints, the assertion might not be valid; it is\npossible that the defender cannot induce the desired outcome. As a result, many\nresults claimed in the literature may be overly optimistic. To remedy, we first\nformally define the utility guarantee of a defender strategy and provide\nexamples to show that the utility of SSE can be higher than its utility\nguarantee. Second, inspired by the analysis of leader's payoff by Von Stengel\nand Zamir (2004), we provide the solution concept called the inducible\nStackelberg equilibrium (ISE), which owns the highest utility guarantee and\nalways exists. Third, we show the conditions when ISE coincides with SSE and\nthe fact that in general case, SSE can be extremely worse with respect to\nutility guarantee. Moreover, introducing the ISE does not invalidate existing\nalgorithmic results as the problem of computing an ISE polynomially reduces to\nthat of computing an SSE. We also provide an algorithmic implementation for\ncomputing ISE, with which our experiments unveil the empirical advantage of the\nISE over the SSE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Nov 2018 09:12:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-12"}

It extends results of Cartis, Gould and Toint (2018) on the\nevaluation complexity to the inexact case: if a $q$th order minimizer is sought\nusing approximations to the first $p$ derivatives, it is proved that a suitable\napproximate minimizer within $\\epsilon$ is computed by the proposed algorithm\nin at most $O(\\epsilon^{-\\frac{p+\\beta}{p-q+\\beta}})$ iterations and at most\n$O(|\\log(\\epsilon)|\\epsilon^{-\\frac{p+\\beta}{p-q+\\beta}})$ approximate\nevaluations. An algorithmic variant, although more rigid in practice, can be\nproved to find such an approximate minimizer in\n$O(|\\log(\\epsilon)|+\\epsilon^{-\\frac{p+\\beta}{p-q+\\beta}})$ evaluations.While\nthe proposed framework remains so far conceptual for high degrees and orders,\nit is shown to yield simple and computationally realistic inexact methods when\nspecialized to the unconstrained and bound-constrained first- and second-order\ncases. The deterministic complexity results are finally extended to the\nstochastic context, yielding adaptive sample-size rules for subsampling methods\ntypical of machine learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Nov 2018 09:39:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2018 09:01:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 19 Apr 2019 13:17:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-22"}

Each of these are promise-problems, and when the promise holds, they\nalways possess unique solutions.\n  We define the complexity class UEOPL to capture problems of this type. We\nfirst define a class that we call EOPL, which consists of all problems that can\nbe reduced to End-of-Potential-Line. This problem merges the canonical\nPPAD-complete problem End-of-Line, with the canonical PLS-complete problem\nSink-of-Dag, and so EOPL captures problems that can be solved by a\nline-following algorithm that also simultaneously decreases a potential\nfunction.\n  Promise-UEOPL is a promise-subclass of EOPL in which the line in the\nEnd-of-Potential-Line instance is guaranteed to be unique via a promise.

This is however not the\ncase for the part of the ear canal that is embedded in the skull, until the\ntypanic membrane. Due to the sensitivity of the outer ear, this part, referred\nto as the bony part, has only been described in a few population studies and\nonly ex-vivo. We present a study of the entire ear canal including the bony\npart and the tympanic membrane. We form an average ear canal from a number of\nMRI scans using standard image registration methods.

We use a custom set of binary population and spectral synthesis\n(BPASS) models to explore the effects of IMF assumptions as a function of\nmetallicity, IMF slope, upper mass limit, IMF power law break mass and\nsampling. We find that while the flux capable of ionizing hydrogen is only\nweakly dependent on IMF parameters, the photon flux responsible for the He II\nand O VI lines is far more sensitive to assumptions. In our current models this\nflux arises primarily from helium and Wolf-Rayet stars which have partially or\nfully lost their hydrogen envelopes.

Even the most extreme IMFs cannot\nreproduce the He II ionizing flux observed in some high redshift galaxies,\nsuggesting a source other than stellar photospheres. We caution that detailed\ninterpretation of features in an individual galaxy spectrum is inevitably going\nto be subject to uncertainties in the IMF of its contributing starbursts.

The general problem setting is that word embeddings are\ninduced on an unlabeled training corpus and then a model is trained that embeds\nnovel words into this induced embedding space. Currently, two approaches for\nlearning embeddings of novel words exist: (i) learning an embedding from the\nnovel word's surface-form (e.g., subword n-grams) and (ii) learning an\nembedding from the context in which it occurs. In this paper, we propose an\narchitecture that leverages both sources of information - surface-form and\ncontext - and show that it results in large increases in embedding quality. Our\narchitecture obtains state-of-the-art results on the Definitional Nonce and\nContextual Rare Words datasets. As input, we only require an embedding set and\nan unlabeled corpus for training our architecture to produce embeddings\nappropriate for the induced embedding space. Thus, our model can easily be\nintegrated into any existing NLP system and enhance its capability to handle\nnovel words.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Nov 2018 11:44:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-12"}

We suggest a method to\nconstruct prior distributions for model defects for reaction models using\nneighboring isotopes of $^{56}$Fe as an example. A model defect is usually a\nfunction of energy and describes the difference between the model prediction\nand the truth. Of course, neither the truth nor the model defect are\naccessible. A Gaussian process (GP) enables to define a probability\ndistribution on possible shapes of a model defect by referring to intuitively\nunderstandable concepts such as smoothness and the expected magnitude of the\ndefect. Standard specifications of GPs impose a typical length-scale and\namplitude valid for the whole energy range, which is often not justified, e.g.,\nwhen the model covers both the resonance and statistical range. In this\ncontribution, we show how a GP with energy-dependent length-scales and\namplitudes can be constructed from available experimental data. The proposed\nconstruction is inspired by a technique called dynamic time warping used, e.g.,\nfor speech recognition. We demonstrate the feasibility of the data-driven\ndetermination of model defects by inferring a model defect of the nuclear\nmodels code TALYS for (n,p) reactions of isotopes with charge number between 20\nand 30. The newly introduced GP parametrization besides its potential to\nimprove evaluations for reactor relevant isotopes, such as $^{56}$Fe, may also\nhelp to better understand the performance of nuclear models in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Nov 2018 12:12:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-26"}

We call $c$\nthe initial number and $d$ the difference of $u$. For each such $u$ we define\nits arithmetic index by $\\lceil\\log_q d\\rceil$ where $d$ is the least positive\ninteger such that $u$ occurs in $\\omega$ as an arithmetic factor with\ndifference $d$. In this paper we study the rate of growth of the arithmetic\nindex of arithmetic factors of a generalization of the Thue-Morse word defined\nover an alphabet of prime cardinality. More precisely, we obtain upper and\nlower bounds for the maximum value of the arithmetic index in $\\omega$ among\nall its arithmetic factors of length $n$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Nov 2018 12:40:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-12"}

Accordingly, the design of reversible QCA\ncircuits is an active field of research.

Based on this, we propose SIN as the fitting function -- a\nconvolutional neural network trained to generate missing sinogram data\nconditioned on scanned data. Besides CNN module, we design two differentiable\nand rapid modules, Radon and Inverse Radon Transformer network, to encapsulate\nthe physical model in the training procedure.

To address this issue we developed a user-friendly approach\nto integrate the stem cell chromatin signature in customized DNA methylation\nanalyses. We used publicly available ChIP-sequencing datasets of several human\nembryonic stem cell (hESC) lines to determine the extent of bivalent chromatin\ngenome-wide. We then created annotated lists of high-confidence bivalent,\nH3K4me3-only and H3K27me3-only chromatin regions. The main features of bivalent\nregions included localization in CGI/promoters, depletion in retroelements and\nenrichment in specific histone modifications, including the poorly\ncharacterized H3K23me2 mark. Moreover, bivalent promoters could be classified\nin three clusters based on PRC2 and PolII complexes occupancy. Genes with\nbivalent promoters of the PRC2-defined cluster displayed the lowest expression\nupon differentiation. As proof-of-concept, we assessed the DNA methylation\npattern of eight types of tumors and confirmed that aberrant cancer-associated\nDNA hypermethylation preferentially targets CGI characterized by bivalent\nchromatin in hESCs.

Strikingly, bivalent CGI were the most\naffected by aberrant DNA hypermethylation in both CpG Island Methylator\nPhenotype-positive (CIMP+) and CIMP-negative tumors, suggesting that, besides\ntranscriptional silencing in the pre-tumorigenic cells, the bivalent chromatin\nsignature in hESCs is a key determinant of the instructive program for aberrant\nDNA methylation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Nov 2018 15:07:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-12"}

The $b$-chromatic number of a graph $G$, denoted\nby $\\chi_b(G)$, is the maximum number $k$ such that $G$ admits a $b$-coloring\nwith $k$ colors.

In particular, the problem of vehicles' power minimization while\nensuring stringent latency and reliability constraints in terms of\nprobabilistic AoI is studied.

After the projection, a proper control policy is\ngenerated by this LQR controller and used at the intermediate time. This\ncontrol paradigm reacts to disturbances immediately and includes rules to\naccount for swing dynamics and leg-retraction. We apply it to a simulated Atlas\nrobot in position-control, always commanded to perform in-place walking. The\nstance hip joint in our robot keeps the torso upright to let the robot\nnaturally fall, and the swing hip joint tracks the desired footstep location.\nCombined with simple Center of Pressure (CoP) damping rules in the low-level\ncontroller, our foot-placement enables the robot to recover from strong pushes\nand produce periodic walking gaits when subject to persistent sources of\ndisturbance, externally or internally.

In contrast to deterministic simulators which\nyield a unique output for each set of input parameters, stochastic simulators\ninherently contain some sources of randomness and the output at a given point\nis a probability density function. Characterizing the stochastic simulators is\neven more time consuming. This paper represents stochastic simulators as a\nstochastic process and describes a metamodeling approach based on the\nKarhunen-Lo\\`eve spectral decomposition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Nov 2018 15:27:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-13"}

We achieve a complete\ndescription of all such patterns for dimension $k=1$ and considerably extend\nthe previous results known for $k=2$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Nov 2018 15:44:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Jan 2019 07:45:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 9 Apr 2019 12:47:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-10"}

Observability problems in such\ngraphs consider whether an agent observing the colors of edges or nodes\ntraversed on a path in the graph can determine which node they are at currently\nor which nodes were visited earlier in the traversal. Previous research efforts\nhave identified several different notions of observability as well as the\nassociated properties of graphs for which those observability properties hold.\nThis paper unifies the prior work into a common framework with several new\nresults about relationships between those notions and associated graph\nproperties.

In this work, we set out to understand the behavior of carbon and\noxygen abundance in stars with different spectral classes, metallicities and V\nsin i , within the metal-rich stellar population.\n  Methods. Masses of these stars were determined using the data from Gaia DR2\nrelease. The oxygen and carbon abundances were determined by fitting the\nabsorption lines.

The typical\narchitecture of an LSTM involves a set of states and gates: the states retain\ninformation over arbitrary time intervals and the gates regulate the flow of\ninformation. Due to the recursive nature of LSTMs, they are computationally\nintensive to deploy on edge devices with limited hardware resources. To reduce\nthe computational complexity of LSTMs, we first introduce a method that learns\nto retain only the important information in the states by pruning redundant\ninformation. We then show that our method can prune over 90% of information in\nthe states without incurring any accuracy degradation over a set of temporal\ntasks. This observation suggests that a large fraction of the recurrent\ncomputations are ineffectual and can be avoided to speed up the process during\nthe inference as they involve noncontributory multiplications/accumulations\nwith zero-valued states. Finally, we introduce a custom hardware accelerator\nthat can perform the recurrent computations using both sparse and dense states.\nExperimental measurements show that performing the computations using the\nsparse states speeds up the process and improves energy efficiency by up to\n5.2x when compared to implementation results of the accelerator performing the\ncomputations using dense states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Nov 2018 15:51:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Nov 2018 22:44:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-03"}

Inspired by Wolfram's 1D cellular\nautomata complexity and life-like structures, we simulated 2D synchronous,\ndiscrete, deterministic cellular automata to reach life-like forms with\n2-states cells. The life-like formations and the oscillators have been\nexplained how they contribute to initiating self-maintenance together with\nself-reproduction and self-replication. After comparing the simulation results,\nwe decided to develop the algorithm for another step.

The\npurpose of this study was to determine the extent of functional change in\nchildren with CP who participated in specific trunk and head postural control\ntraining combined with physical therapy treatment as usual (TAU).\n  Methods This study included 140 consecutive referrals to a centre\nspecialising in head and trunk postural control (Targeted Training (TT))\nbetween 2009 and 2016. Twenty-five children discontinued therapy due to\nsurgery, health, family issues or poor attendance. The remaining 115 children\n(46 girls, 69 boys) had a mean age of 6 y 6 mo (SD 2 y 8 mo) with participants\nfrom all GMFCS levels. The intervention was a program of TT and ongoing TAU\nwith a mean duration of 11 months. Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM),\nPediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory functional skills, Chailey Levels\nof Ability and Segmental Assessment of Trunk Control were administered before\nand after the intervention.\n  Results There were significant improvements in all outcomes. GMFM\nimprovements exceeded those predicted from the published reference curves,\nespecially for the children with more severe cerebral palsy.\n  Conclusions Functional improvement exceeded the expected norm, especially in\nthose children with more severe gross motor function disability. The other\noutcomes also showed significant improvements. These findings support the case\nfor further studies and, if needed, tool development to facilitate\ndetermination of the critical elements in a combined therapy approach of TT\nwith TAU.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Nov 2018 13:56:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-03"}

This, in fact, can be regarded as one of\nthe highest forthcoming priorities of future networks. In this paper, we\npropose a system for Out-Patient (OP) centric Long Term Evolution-Advanced\n(LTE-A) network optimization. Big data harvested from the OPs' medical records,\nalong with current readings from their body sensors are processed and analyzed\nto predict the likelihood of a life-threatening medical condition, for\ninstance, an imminent stroke. This prediction is used to ensure that the OP is\nassigned an optimal LTE-A Physical Resource Blocks (PRBs) to transmit their\ncritical data to their healthcare provider with minimal delay. To the best of\nour knowledge, this is the first time big data analytics are utilized to\noptimize a cellular network in an OP-conscious manner. The PRBs assignment is\noptimized using Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and a real-time\nheuristic. Two approaches are proposed, the Weighted Sum Rate Maximization\n(WSRMax) approach and the Proportional Fairness (PF) approach. The approaches\nincreased the OPs' average SINR by 26.6% and 40.5%, respectively. The WSRMax\napproach increased the system's total SINR to a level higher than that of the\nPF approach, however, the PF approach reported higher SINRs for the OPs, better\nfairness and a lower margin of error.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Nov 2018 12:06:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-13"}

The\nmathematical morphology is implemented to automatically label the\ndecision-making data into three styles (moderate, vague, and aggressive), while\nthe integration of kMC and KNN helps to improve the recognition speed and\naccuracy. Our developed mathematical morphology-based clustering algorithm is\nthen validated by comparing to agglomerative hierarchical clustering.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the developed kMC-KNN method, in\ncomparison to the traditional KNN, can shorten the recognition time by over\n72.67% with recognition accuracy of 90%-98%. In addition, our developed kMC-KNN\nmethod also outperforms the support vector machine (SVM) in recognition\naccuracy and stability.
