The capacity, that is, a\nbound on the stored or extractable energy, is derived with the help of the\nenergy-entropy diagram, and this bound is respected as long as the charging and\ndischarging processes are entropy preserving. While studying power, we consider\na geometric approach for the evolution of the battery state in the energy\neigenspace of the battery Hamiltonian. Then, an upper bound for power is\nderived for arbitrary charging process, in terms of the Fisher information and\nthe energy variance of the battery. The former quantifies the speed of\nevolution, and the latter encodes the nonlocal character of the battery state.\nIndeed, due to the fact that the energy variance is bounded by the multipartite\nentanglement properties of batteries composed of qubits, we establish a\nfundamental bound on power imposed by quantum entanglement. We also discuss\nparadigmatic models for batteries that saturate the bounds both for the stored\nenergy and power. Several experimentally realizable quantum batteries, based on\nintegrable spin chains, the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick and the Dicke models, are also\nstudied in the light of these newly introduced bounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Nov 2018 16:35:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Dec 2019 14:32:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 4 May 2020 11:05:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-05"}

We introduce a\nframework for safely learning a control strategy for a given system with an\nadditive disturbance. On the basis of the known part of the model, a safe set\nin which the system can learn safely, the algorithm can choose optimal actions\nfor pursuing the target set as long as the safety-preserving condition is\nsatisfied. After some learning episodes, the disturbance can be updated based\non real-world data. To this end, Gaussian Process regression is conducted on\nthe collected disturbance samples. Since the unstable nature of the law of the\nreal world, for example, change of friction or conductivity with the\ntemperature, we expect to have the more robust solution of optimal control\nproblem.\n  For evaluation of approach described above we choose an inverted pendulum as\na benchmark model. The proposed algorithm manages to learn a policy that does\nnot violate the pre-specified safety constraints.

Observations with the Very Large Array (VLA) from Continuum\nHaloes in Nearby Galaxies - an EVLA Survey (CHANG-ES) are combined with those\nwith the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS\n) to identify the prevailing mode of cosmic-ray transport in the edge-on spiral\ngalaxy NGC 3556. We mapped the radio spectral index, magnetic field strength,\nand orientation using VLA 1.5 and 6 GHz and LOFAR 144 MHz data, and we fit 1D\ncosmic-ray propagation models to these maps using Spinnaker (Spectral Index\nNumerical Analysis of K(c)osmic-ray electron radio emission) and its\ninteractive wrapper Spinteractive. We find that the spectral index in the\ngalactic midplane is, as expected for young CRe, alpha ~ -0.7 and steepens\ntowards the halo of the galaxy as a consequence of spectral ageing. The\nintensity scale heights are about 1.4 and 1.9 kpc for the thin disc, and 3.3\nand 5.9 kpc for the thick disc at 1.5 GHz and 144 MHz, respectively. While pure\ndiffusion cannot explain our data, advection can, particularly if we assume a\nlinearly accelerating wind.

This galactic wind scenario is corroborated by the\nexistence of vertical filaments seen both in the radio continuum and in H alpha\nin the disc-halo interface and of a large-scale reservoir of hot, X-ray\nemitting gas in the halo.

Notably, while the system generally favors d-wave pairing,\nthe absence of the particle-hole symmetry necessarily induces parasitic s-wave\npairing.

For example, in the standard closeness testing problem, Alice and Bob\neach have $t$ samples from, respectively, distributions $a$ and $b$ over $[n]$,\nand they need to test whether $a=b$ or $a,b$ are $\\epsilon$-far for some fixed\n$\\epsilon>0$. This is in contrast to the well-studied one-party case, where the\ntester has unrestricted access to samples of both distributions, for which\noptimal bounds are known for a number of variations. Despite being a natural\nconstraint in applications, the two-party setting has evaded attention so far.\n  We address two fundamental aspects: 1) what is the communication complexity,\nand 2) can it be accomplished securely, without Alice and Bob learning extra\ninformation about each other's input. Besides closeness testing, we also study\nthe independence testing problem, where Alice and Bob have $t$ samples from\ndistributions $a$ and $b$ respectively, which may be correlated; the question\nis whether $a,b$ are independent of $\\epsilon$-far from being independent.\n  Our contribution is three-fold:\n  1) Communication: we show how to gain communication efficiency with more\nsamples, beyond the information-theoretic bound on $t$. The gain is\npolynomially better than what one obtains by adapting standard algorithms.\n  2) Lower bounds: we prove tightness of our protocols for the closeness\ntesting, and for the independence testing when the number of samples is\nunbounded. These lower bounds are of independent interest as these are the\nfirst 2-party communication lower bounds for testing problems.\n  3) Security: we define secure distribution testing and argue that it must\nleak at least some minimal information. We then provide secure versions of the\nabove protocols with an overhead that is only polynomial in the security\nparameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Nov 2018 18:52:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-12"}

Using numerical experiments, we present a strategy for using\nvery early-time spectroscopy to determine the upper limit to the progenitor\nmass distribution for type II-P SNe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Nov 2018 19:00:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-28"}

In\nthis paper it will be shown that the mathematical model in single-photon\napproximation may predict another behavior of this probability generally.\nNamely, the probability to find the atom in the excited state may tend to a\nnonzero constant so that the atom is not in the pure state finally.

The hadrons of\ndifferent quantum numbers $J^P$ appear in a fairly narrow energy band, where\n$J^P$ refers to the spin-parity of a hadron at rest. This poses a challenge for\nLattice QCD studies of (coupled-channel) meson-meson scattering aimed at the\ndetermination of scattering amplitudes and resonance pole positions. A wealth\nof information for this purpose can be obtained from the lattice spectra in\nframes with nonzero total momentum. These are particularly dense since hadrons\nwith different $J^P$ contribute to any given lattice irreducible\nrepresentation. This is because $J^P$ is not a good quantum number in flight,\nand also because the continuum symmetry is reduced on the lattice. In this\npaper we address the assignment of the underlying continuum $J^P$ quantum\nnumbers to charmonia in flight using a $N_f = 2 + 1$ CLS ensemble. As a first\nstep, we apply the single-hadron approach, where only interpolating fields of\nquark-antiquark type are used. The approach follows techniques previously\napplied to the light meson spectrum by the Hadron Spectrum Collaboration.

This paper aims to propose a Second Order Stein formula to\ncharacterize the variance of such random variables for all functions $f(z)$\nwith square integrable gradient, and to demonstrate the usefulness of this\nformula in various applications.\n  In the Gaussian sequence model, a consequence of Stein's formula is Stein's\nUnbiased Risk Estimate (SURE), an unbiased estimate of the mean squared risk\nfor almost any estimator $\\hat\\mu$ of the unknown mean. A first application of\nthe Second Order Stein formula is an Unbiased Risk Estimate for SURE itself\n(SURE for SURE): an unbiased estimate {providing} information about the squared\ndistance between SURE and the squared estimation error of $\\hat\\mu$. SURE for\nSURE has a simple form as a function of the data and is applicable to all\n$\\hat\\mu$ with square integrable gradient, e.g. the Lasso and the Elastic Net.\n  In addition to SURE for SURE, the following applications are developed: (1)\nUpper bounds on the risk of SURE when the estimation target is the mean squared\nerror; (2) Confidence regions based on SURE; (3) Oracle inequalities satisfied\nby SURE-tuned estimates; (4) An upper bound on the variance of the size of the\nmodel selected by the Lasso; (5) Explicit expressions of SURE for SURE for the\nLasso and the Elastic-Net; (6) In the linear model, a general semi-parametric\nscheme to de-bias a differentiable initial estimator for inference of a\nlow-dimensional projection of the unknown $\\beta$, with a characterization of\nthe variance after de-biasing; and (7) An accuracy analysis of a Gaussian Monte\nCarlo scheme to approximate the divergence of functions $f: R^n\\to R^n$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Nov 2018 20:08:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 17 Nov 2018 23:53:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 28 Aug 2019 22:40:44 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 2020 04:30:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-10"}

This work\nfocusses on InPhase denoising which is a fundamental restoration step to many\nposterior applications of InPhase, namely to phase unwrapping. The presence of\nsharp fringes that arises from phase wrapping makes InPhase denoising a\nhard-inverse problem.

In particular, the optimal unconstrained precoder is\napproximated by selecting a variable number of elements from a basis that is\nconstructed as a function of the transmitter array response, where the number\nof selected basis elements can be chosen according to the feedback constraint.\nSimulation results show that the proposed precoding scheme can provide a\nnear-optimal solution if a higher feedback overhead can be afforded. For a low\noverhead, it can still provide a good approximation of the optimal precoder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Nov 2018 21:24:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Jun 2019 20:39:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-02"}

A well known difficulty in using RNNs is the\n\\textit{vanishing or exploding gradient} problem. Recently, there have been\nseveral different RNN architectures that try to mitigate this issue by\nmaintaining an orthogonal or unitary recurrent weight matrix. One such\narchitecture is the scaled Cayley orthogonal recurrent neural network (scoRNN)\nwhich parameterizes the orthogonal recurrent weight matrix through a scaled\nCayley transform. This parametrization contains a diagonal scaling matrix\nconsisting of positive or negative one entries that can not be optimized by\ngradient descent. Thus the scaling matrix is fixed before training and a\nhyperparameter is introduced to tune the matrix for each particular task. In\nthis paper, we develop a unitary RNN architecture based on a complex scaled\nCayley transform. Unlike the real orthogonal case, the transformation uses a\ndiagonal scaling matrix consisting of entries on the complex unit circle which\ncan be optimized using gradient descent and no longer requires the tuning of a\nhyperparameter. We also provide an analysis of a potential issue of the modReLU\nactiviation function which is used in our work and several other unitary RNNs.\nIn the experiments conducted, the scaled Cayley unitary recurrent neural\nnetwork (scuRNN) achieves comparable or better results than scoRNN and other\nunitary RNNs without fixing the scaling matrix.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Nov 2018 21:37:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Feb 2019 16:06:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-26"}

This has led to a number of count\nestimation procedures which work well in one scenario but perform poorly in\nothers. A practitioner is faced with two basic, unanswered questions. Which\nvariant should be chosen when the data is unknown? Given an estimate, is its\nerror sufficiently small to be trustworthy?\n  We provide answers to these questions.

The great number of parameters involved\nrequires both the study of large samples and individual encounters where\nparticular features, motions, and perturbations can be traced and analysed in\ndetail. We analysed the morphology, kinematics, and dynamics of two luminous\ninfrared spiral galaxies, NGC 5257 and NGC 5258, in which SF is mostly confined\nto the spiral arms, in order to understand interactions between galaxies of\nequivalent masses and SF processes during the encounter. Using scanning\nFabry-Perot interferometry, we studied the contribution of circular and\nnon-circular motions and the response of the ionized gas to external\nperturbations. We compared the kinematics with direct images of the pair and\ntraced the SF processes and gravitational effects due to the presence of the\nother galaxy. The SED of each member of the pair was fitted. A mass model was\nfitted to the rotation curve of each galaxy. Large, non-circular motions\ndetected in both galaxies are associated with a bar, spiral arms, and HII\nregions for the inner parts of the galaxies, and with the tidal interaction for\nthe outer parts of the discs. Bifurcations in the rotation curves indicate that\nthe galaxies have recently undergone their pericentric passage. The pattern\nspeed of a perturbation of one of the galaxies is computed.

However, each of them carries significant uncertainties which have\nseriously limited our ability to reliably recover the physical properties of\ngalaxies from the analysis of their SEDs. In this paper, we present a Bayesian\nframework to deal with these uncertain components simultaneously. Based on the\nBayesian evidence, a quantitative implement of the principle of Occam's razor,\nthe method allows a more objective and quantitative discrimination among the\ndifferent assumptions about these uncertain components. With a Ks-selected\nsample of 5467 low-redshift (mostly with $z\\lesssim 1$) galaxies in the\nCOSMOS/UltraVISTA field and classified into passively evolving galaxies (PEGs)\nand star-forming galaxies (SFGs) with UVJ diagram, we present a Bayesian\ndiscrimination of a set of 16 SSP models from five research groups (BC03 and\nCB07, M05, GALEV, Yunnan-II, BPASS V2.0), five forms of SFH (Burst, Constant,\nExp-dec, Exp-inc, Delayed-$\\tau$), and four kinds of DAL (Calzetti law, MW,\nLMC, SMC). We show that the results obtained with the method are either obvious\nor understandable in the context of galaxy physics.

An ATNNFAE consists of\nan auto-encoder where the internal code is normalized on the unit sphere and\ncorrupted by additive noise. Simultaneously, a replica of the decoder (sharing\nthe same parameters as the AE decoder) is used as the generator and fed with\nrandom latent vectors. An adversarial discriminator is trained to distinguish\ntraining samples reconstructed from the AE from samples produced through the\nrandom-input generator, making the entire generator-discriminator path\ndifferentiable for discrete data like text. The combined effect of noise\ninjection in the code and shared weights between the decoder and the generator\ncan prevent the mode collapsing phenomenon commonly observed in GANs. Since\nperplexity cannot be applied to non-sequential text generation, we propose a\nnew evaluation method using the total variance distance between frequencies of\nhash-coded byte-level n-grams (NGTVD).

In quantum information theory, there are three\ngeneralizations of the classical R\\'enyi divergence -- the Petz's, sandwiched,\nand log-Euclidean versions, that possess meaningful operational interpretation.\nHowever, the associated quantum R\\'enyi and Augustin information are much less\nexplored compared with their classical counterpart, and lacking crucial\nproperties hinders applications of these quantities to error exponent analysis\nin the quantum regime. The goal of this paper is to analyze fundamental\nproperties of the R\\'enyi and Augustin information from a noncommutative\nmeasure-theoretic perspective. Firstly, we prove the uniform equicontinuity for\nall three quantum versions of R\\'enyi and Augustin information, and it hence\nyields the joint continuity of these quantities in order and prior input\ndistributions.

Next, a geometric formulation is given of non-equilibrium\nthermodynamic processes, in terms of Hamiltonian dynamics defined by\nHamiltonian functions that are homogeneous of degree one in the co-extensive\nvariables and zero on the homogeneous Lagrangian submanifold. The\ncorrespondence between objects in contact geometry and their homogeneous\ncounterparts in symplectic geometry, as already largely present in the\nliterature, appears to be elegant and effective. This culminates in the\ndefinition of port-thermodynamic systems, and the formulation of\ninterconnection ports. The resulting geometric framework is illustrated on a\nnumber of simple examples, already indicating its potential for analysis and\ncontrol.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Nov 2018 10:20:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-26"}

The linear Boltzmann transport\nequation is applied to obtain the perturbation to the electron distribution by\ndifferent scattering mechanisms. The mobility is mainly limited by the\ndeformation-potential interaction with long-wavelength acoustic vibrations at\nlow carrier concentrations. At high concentrations, ionized impurity scattering\nbecomes stronger. The electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient are\ncalculated accurately over various ranges of temperature and carrier\nconcentration. The lattice thermal conductivity of PbI$_2$, 0.065 W/mK at 300\nK, is the lowest among other 2D thermoelectric materials. Such ultralow thermal\nconductivity is attributed to large atomic mass, weak interatomic bonding,\nstrong anharmonicity, and localized vibrations in which the vast majority of\nheat is trapped. These electrical and phonon transport properties enable high\nthermoelectric figure of merit over 1 for both p-type and n-type doping from\n300 K to 900 K. A maximum $zT$ of 4.9 is achieved at 900 K with an electron\nconcentration of 1.9$\\times$10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$.

We build upon this finding and further address the\njoint questions of their time-evolution, and of the formation of flare loops at\nthe ends of flaring PILs of the erupting bipole, which are both relevant for\nflare understanding in general and for ICME studies in particular. We calculate\nQSLs and relevant field lines in an MHD simulation of a torus-unstable\nflux-rope.

We also analyse flare-ribbons as observed in EUV by SDO/AIA and IRIS\nduring two X-class flares. The flux-rope footpoints are drifting during the\neruption, which is unexpected due to line-tying. This drifting is due to a\nseries of coronal reconnections that erode the flux rope on one side and\nenlarge it on the other side. Other changes in the flux-rope footpoint-area are\ndue to multiple reconnections of individual field lines whose topology can\nevolve sequentially from arcade to flux rope and finally to flare loop.

Such experiments are traditionally performed by studying the active\nor the brownian fluctuation of trapped particles in the X, Y, Z direction. Here\nwe find that employing the fourth dimension, rotation, allows for sensitive and\nfast probing of the surface. Optical tweezers are capable of rotating trapped\nbirefringent microparticles when applied with circularly polarized light, thus\ncalled the Rotational Optical Tweezers. When the trapped birefringent\nmicroparticle is far enough away from the surface, the rotation rate is\ndependent only on the laser power. However, we find that if one traps close to\na surface, the rotation rate goes to zero even at finite tweezers laser powers\nfor some specific type of substrates. We suspect this to be due to interaction\nbetween the substrate and the birefringent particle, keeping in mind that the\nhydrodynamic drag for this mode of rotation cannot increase beyond 1.2 times\nthe drag away from the surface. We use this to probe some surfaces and find\nthat there is no binding for hydrophobic ones but hydrophilic ones particularly\ntend to show a power threshold beyond which the birefringent particle starts\nrotating.

A general construction of the\nstochastic intervention model was developed as a Markov process with discrete\ntime, controlled at the time it hits the boundary of a given subset of a set of\nstates. Thus, the problem of optimal control of interventions is reduced to a\ntheoretical problem of control by the specified process or the problem of\ntuning.

It is proved that the optimal control in such a problem is\ndeterministic and is determined by the global maximum point of the function of\ntwo discrete variables, for which an explicit analytical representation is\nobtained.
