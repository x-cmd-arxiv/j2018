Accordingly, anomaly detection is\nimportant both for analyzing the anomalies themselves and for cleaning the data\nfor further analysis of its ambient structure. Nonetheless, a precise\ndefinition of anomalies is important for automated detection and herein we\napproach such problems from the perspective of detecting sparse latent effects\nembedded in large collections of noisy data. Standard Graphical Lasso-based\ntechniques can identify the conditional dependency structure of a collection of\nrandom variables based on their sample covariance matrix. However, classic\nGraphical Lasso is sensitive to outliers in the sample covariance matrix. In\nparticular, several outliers in a sample covariance matrix can destroy the\nsparsity of its inverse. Accordingly, we propose a novel optimization problem\nthat is similar in spirit to Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) and\nsplits the sample covariance matrix $M$ into two parts, $M=F+S$, where $F$ is\nthe cleaned sample covariance whose inverse is sparse and computable by\nGraphical Lasso, and $S$ contains the outliers in $M$. We accomplish this\ndecomposition by adding an additional $ \\ell_1$ penalty to classic Graphical\nLasso, and name it \"Robust Graphical Lasso (Rglasso)\". Moreover, we propose an\nAlternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) solution to the optimization\nproblem which scales to large numbers of unknowns. We evaluate our algorithm on\nboth real and synthetic datasets, obtaining interpretable results and\noutperforming the standard robust Minimum Covariance Determinant (MCD) method\nand Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) regarding both accuracy and\nspeed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Nov 2018 16:15:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-13"}

This new model in essence views the whole\ntarget network as one integral piece in which traffic propagates based on\ntraffic flow dynamics, vehicle paths, and traffic control. In light of this\ncentralized traffic control concept, most requirements for the existing traffic\ncontrol coordination will be dropped in the optimal traffic control operations,\nsuch as the common cycle length or offsets. Instead, the optimal traffic\ncontrol strategy across intersections will be highly adaptive over time to\nminimize the total travel time and it can also prevent any short-term traffic\ncongestions according to the space-time characteristics of vehicle path flows.\nA mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation is then presented to\nmodel the propagations of path flows given a centralized traffic control\nstrategy. Secondly, a new approximated Lagrangian decomposition framework is\npresented. Solving the proposed MILP model with the traditional Lagrangian\ndecomposition approach faces the leveraging challenge between the problem\ntractability after decomposition and computing complexity. To address this\nissue, we propose an approximate Lagrangian decomposition framework in which\nthe target problem is reformulated into an approximated problem by constructing\nits complicating attributes into the objective function instead of in\nconstraints to reduce the computing complexity. The computing efficiency loss\nof the objective function can be mitigated via multiple advanced computing\ntechniques.

The model develops a dense\nspectrum above the ground state, due to which the model becomes nearly\nconformal. This suggests that a holographic dual may exist, which makes the SYK\nmodel interesting in the study of quantum gravity. It has been found that the\nSYK model is similar to large $N$ tensor models: in both models, only the\nmelonic diagrams survive in the large $N$ limit. In this thesis, we explore the\nlarge $N$ tensor model with $O(N)^3$ symmetry containing two flavors of\nMajorana fermions in the fundamental representation. Its quartic Hamiltonian\ndepends on a real parameter $\\beta$. We derive the kernels of the four point\nfunctions. With the spectra that we find from the kernels, we calculate the\nscaling dimensions of several types of conformal primaries. We also find a\nduality relation between two Hamiltonians of different values of $\\beta$. This\nis not a perfect duality, because the normalization of energy scales with the\ntransformation. Nevertheless, the ratios of the energies are the same, and the\noperator dimensions are preserved. In addition, we discover that for $\\beta >\n1$ or $\\beta < 0$ the scaling dimensions of one of the conformal primaries\nbecome complex, rendering the model unstable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Nov 2018 01:15:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-19"}

Being\ncentral for a user of a network leads to several benefits to the user: central\nusers are highly influential and play key roles within the network. Therefore,\nthe optimization problem of increasing the centrality of a network user\nrecently received considerable attention. Given a network and a target user\n$v$, the centrality maximization problem consists in creating $k$ new links\nincident to $v$ in such a way that the centrality of $v$ is maximized,\naccording to some centrality metric. Most of the algorithms proposed in the\nliterature are based on showing that a given centrality metric is monotone and\nsubmodular with respect to link addition. However, this property does not hold\nfor several shortest-path based centrality metrics if the links are undirected.\nIn this paper we study the centrality maximization problem in undirected\nnetworks for one of the most important shortest-path based centrality measures,\nthe coverage centrality. We provide several hardness and approximation results.\nWe first show that the problem cannot be approximated within a factor greater\nthan $1-1/e$, unless $P=NP$, and, under the stronger gap-ETH hypothesis, the\nproblem cannot be approximated within a factor better than $1/n^{o(1)}$, where\n$n$ is the number of users. We then propose two greedy approximation\nalgorithms, and show that, by suitably combining them, we can guarantee an\napproximation factor of $\\Omega(1/\\sqrt{n})$. We experimentally compare the\nsolutions provided by our approximation algorithm with optimal solutions\ncomputed by means of an exact IP formulation. We show that our algorithm\nproduces solutions that are very close to the optimum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Nov 2018 01:19:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-13"}

To solve this\nissue, previous studies use 3D registration techniques. Out of these proposed\ntechniques, detecting points of correspondence is proven to be an efficient\nmethod given that the data belongs to the same individual. However, if the data\nbelongs to different persons, the registration algorithms can convert the 3D\npoint cloud of one person to another, destroying the distinguishing features\nbetween the two point clouds. Another issue regarding the storage size of the\npoint clouds. That is, if the captured depth image contains around 50 thousand\npoints in the cloud for a single pose for one individual, then the storage size\nof the entire dataset will be in order of giga if not tera bytes.

It is widely believed that social networks play\nimportant role in the process of information diffusion. However, the opposite\nquestion, i.e., how does information diffusion process rebuild social networks,\nhas been largely ignored. In this paper, we propose a new framework for\nunderstanding this reversing effect. Specifically, we first introduce a novel\ninformation diffusion model on social networks, by considering two types of\nindividuals, i.e., smart and normal individuals, and two kinds of messages,\ntrue and false messages. Since social networks consist of human individuals,\nwho have self-learning ability, in such a way that the trust of an individual\nto one of its neighbors increases (or decreases) if this individual received a\ntrue (or false) message from that neighbor. Based on such a simple\nself-learning mechanism, we prove that a social network can indeed become\nsmarter, in terms of better distinguishing the true message from the false one.\nMoreover, we observe the emergence of social stratification based on the new\nmodel, i.e., the true messages initially posted by an individual closer to the\nsmart one can be forwarded by more others, which is enhanced by the\nself-learning mechanism. We also find the crossover advantage, i.e.,\ninterconnection between two chain networks can make the related individuals\npossessing higher social influences, i.e., their messages can be forwarded by\nrelatively more others.

The material property\ncombinations which make this possible were first revealed by a novel level set\nbased topology optimization process which we describe. The optimization process\nrevealed that a 2-phase unit cell in which one of the phases is simultaneously\nlighter and stiffer than the other results in dynamic behavior which has all\nthe attendant characteristics of a locally resonant composite including\nnegative effective properties far below the homogenization limit.

A key insight behind ConcurORAM is the fact\nthat, during multi-client data access, only a subset of the\nconcurrently-accessed server-hosted data structures require access privacy\nguarantees. Everything else can be safely implemented as oblivious data\nstructures that are later synced securely and efficiently during an ORAM\n\"eviction\". Further, since a major contributor to latency is the eviction - in\nwhich client-resident data is reshuffled and reinserted back encrypted into the\nmain server database - ConcurORAM also enables multiple concurrent clients to\nevict asynchronously, in parallel (without compromising consistency), and in\nthe background without having to block ongoing queries. As a result, throughput\nscales well with increasing number of concurrent clients and is not\nsignificantly impacted by evictions. For example, about 65 queries per second\ncan be executed in parallel by 30 concurrent clients, a 2x speedup over the\nstate-of-the-art. The query access time for individual clients increases by\nonly 2x when compared to a single-client deployment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Nov 2018 07:38:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Dec 2018 21:11:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2018 02:28:50 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2018 07:23:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-14"}

First, the common aspects are usually very sparse,\nwhich is caused by the sparsity of user-product interactions and the diversity\nof individual users' vocabularies. Second, a user's interests on aspects could\nbe different with respect to different products, which are usually assumed to\nbe static in existing methods. In this paper, we propose an Attentive\nAspect-based Recommendation Model (AARM) to tackle these challenges.

The\nobservations reveal a highly collimated SiO jet extending from the 1.3 mm\ncontinuum source, which connects to a slightly wider but still highly\ncollimated CO outflow. Rotational features perpendicular to the outflow axis\nare detected in various molecular emissions, including SiO, SO2, H2S, CH3OH,\nand H2CO emissions. Based on their spatial distributions and kinematics, we\nfind that they trace different parts of the envelope-disk system. The SiO\nemission traces the disk and inner envelope in addition to the jet. The CH3OH\nand H2CO emissions mostly trace the infalling-rotating envelope, and are\nenhanced around the transition region between envelope and disk, i.e., the\ncentrifugal barrier. The SO2 and H2S emissions are enhanced around the\ncentrifugal barrier, and also trace the outer part of the disk. Envelope\nkinematics are consistent with rotating-infalling motion, while those of the\ndisk are consistent with Keplerian rotation. The radius and velocity of the\ncentrifugal barrier are estimated to be about 530 au and 6 km/s, leading to a\ncentral mass of about 11 solar masses, consistent with estimates based on\nspectral energy distribution fitting. These results indicate that an ordered\ntransition from an infalling-rotating envelope to a Keplerian disk through a\ncentrifugal barrier, accompanied by changes of types of molecular line\nemissions, is a valid description of this massive protostellar source.

By constructing a user's profile\nwith the items that the user has consumed, ICF recommends items that are\nsimilar to the user's profile. With the prevalence of machine learning in\nrecent years, significant processes have been made for ICF by learning item\nsimilarity (or representation) from data. Nevertheless, we argue that most\nexisting works have only considered linear and shallow relationship between\nitems, which are insufficient to capture the complicated decision-making\nprocess of users.\n  In this work, we propose a more expressive ICF solution by accounting for the\nnonlinear and higher-order relationship among items. Going beyond modeling only\nthe second-order interaction (e.g. similarity) between two items, we\nadditionally consider the interaction among all interacted item pairs by using\nnonlinear neural networks. Through this way, we can effectively model the\nhigher-order relationship among items, capturing more complicated effects in\nuser decision-making. For example, it can differentiate which historical\nitemsets in a user's profile are more important in affecting the user to make a\npurchase decision on an item. We treat this solution as a deep variant of ICF,\nthus term it as DeepICF. To justify our proposal, we perform empirical studies\non two public datasets from MovieLens and Pinterest. Extensive experiments\nverify the highly positive effect of higher-order item interaction modeling\nwith nonlinear neural networks. Moreover, we demonstrate that by more\nfine-grained second-order interaction modeling with attention network, the\nperformance of our DeepICF method can be further improved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Nov 2018 11:06:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-13"}

This\nposes an imbalanced learning problem, since the scale of missing entries is\nusually much larger than that of observed entries, but they cannot be ignored\ndue to the valuable negative signal. For efficiency concern, existing work\ntypically applies a uniform weight on missing entries to allow a fast learning\nalgorithm. However, this simplification will decrease modeling fidelity,\nresulting in suboptimal performance for downstream applications.\n  In this work, we weight the missing data non-uniformly, and more generically,\nwe allow any weighting strategy on the missing data. To address the efficiency\nchallenge, we propose a fast learning method, for which the time complexity is\ndetermined by the number of observed entries in the data matrix, rather than\nthe matrix size. The key idea is two-fold: 1) we apply truncated SVD on the\nweight matrix to get a more compact representation of the weights, and 2) we\nlearn MF parameters with element-wise alternating least squares (eALS) and\nmemorize the key intermediate variables to avoid repeating computations that\nare unnecessary.

Let $n$ be the number of vertices, $m$ be the number\nof edges, and $n_k$ be the number of $k$-cliques. Previous work by Eden, Ron\nand Seshadhri (STOC 2018) gives an $O^*(\\frac{n}{n^{1/k}_k} +\n\\frac{m^{k/2}}{n_k})$-time algorithm for this problem (we use $O^*(\\cdot)$ to\nsuppress $\\poly(\\log n, 1/\\epsilon, k^k)$ dependencies). Moreover, this bound\nis nearly optimal when the expression is sublinear in the size of the graph.\n  Our motivation is to circumvent this lower bound, by parameterizing the\ncomplexity in terms of \\emph{graph arboricity}. The arboricity of $G$ is a\nmeasure for the graph density \"everywhere\". We design an algorithm for the\nclass of graphs with arboricity at most $\\alpha$, whose running time is\n$O^*(\\min\\{\\frac{n\\alpha^{k-1}}{n_k},\\, \\frac{n}{n_k^{1/k}}+\\frac{m\n\\alpha^{k-2}}{n_k} \\})$.

Our result implies that for any minor-closed\nfamily of graphs, there is a $(1\\pm\\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for $n_k$\nthat has running time $O^*(\\frac{n}{n_k})$. Such a bound was not known even for\nthe special (classic) case of triangle counting in planar graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Nov 2018 14:43:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-13"}

However, human\nemotional states are quite complex. To appraise such states displayed in\nreal-world settings, we need expressive emotional descriptors that are capable\nof capturing and describing this complexity. The circumplex model of affect,\nwhich is described in terms of valence (i.e., how positive or negative is an\nemotion) and arousal (i.e., power of the activation of the emotion), can be\nused for this purpose. Recent progress in the emotion recognition domain has\nbeen achieved through the development of deep neural architectures and the\navailability of very large training databases. To this end, Aff-Wild has been\nthe first large-scale \"in-the-wild\" database, containing around 1,200,000\nframes. In this paper, we build upon this database, extending it with 260 more\nsubjects and 1,413,000 new video frames. We call the union of Aff-Wild with the\nadditional data, Aff-Wild2. The videos are downloaded from Youtube and have\nlarge variations in pose, age, illumination conditions, ethnicity and\nprofession. Both database-specific as well as cross-database experiments are\nperformed in this paper, by utilizing the Aff-Wild2, along with the RECOLA\ndatabase. The developed deep neural architectures are based on the joint\ntraining of state-of-the-art convolutional and recurrent neural networks with\nattention mechanism; thus exploiting both the invariant properties of\nconvolutional features, while modeling temporal dynamics that arise in human\nbehaviour via the recurrent layers. The obtained results show premise for\nutilization of the extended Aff-Wild, as well as of the developed deep neural\narchitectures for visual analysis of human behaviour in terms of continuous\nemotion dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Nov 2018 01:57:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Dec 2019 23:44:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-17"}

Various approaches have been proposed for: i) discrete\nemotion recognition in terms of the primary facial expressions; ii) emotion\nanalysis in terms of facial Action Units (AUs), assuming a fixed expression\nintensity; iii) dimensional emotion analysis, in terms of valence and arousal\n(VA). These approaches can only be effective, if they are developed using\nlarge, appropriately annotated databases, showing behaviors of people\nin-the-wild, i.e., in uncontrolled environments. Aff-Wild has been the first,\nlarge-scale, in-the-wild database (including around 1,200,000 frames of 300\nvideos), annotated in terms of VA. In the vast majority of existing emotion\ndatabases, their annotation is limited to either primary expressions, or\nvalence-arousal, or action units. In this paper, we first annotate a part\n(around $234,000$ frames) of the Aff-Wild database in terms of $8$ AUs and\nanother part (around $288,000$ frames) in terms of the $7$ basic emotion\ncategories, so that parts of this database are annotated in terms of VA, as\nwell as AUs, or primary expressions. Then, we set up and tackle multi-task\nlearning for emotion recognition, as well as for facial image generation.\nMulti-task learning is performed using: i) a deep neural network with shared\nhidden layers, which learns emotional attributes by exploiting their\ninter-dependencies; ii) a discriminator of a generative adversarial network\n(GAN). On the other hand, image generation is implemented through the generator\nof the GAN. For these two tasks, we carefully design loss functions that fit\nthe examined set-up. Experiments are presented which illustrate the good\nperformance of the proposed approach when applied to the new annotated parts of\nthe Aff-Wild database.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Nov 2018 15:40:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Dec 2019 23:39:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-17"}
