Manual segmentation is laborious, and\nimpractical for large-scale use. For routine clinical use, and in clinical\ntrials that apply the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST),\nclinicians typically outline the boundaries of a lesion on a single slice to\nextract diameter measurements. In this work, we have collected a large-scale\ndatabase, named LesionVis, with pixel-wise manual 2D lesion delineations on the\nRECIST-slices. To extend the 2D segmentations to 3D, we propose a volumetric\nprogressive lesion segmentation (PLS) algorithm to automatically segment the 3D\nlesion volume from 2D delineations using a scale-invariant and boundary-aware\ndeep convolutional network (SIBA-Net). The SIBA-Net copes with the size\ntransition of a lesion when the PLS progresses from the RECIST-slice to the\nedge-slices, as well as when performing longitudinal assessment of lesions\nwhose size change over multiple time points. The proposed PLS-SiBA-Net (P-SiBA)\napproach is assessed on the lung lesion cases from LesionVis. Our experimental\nresults demonstrate that the P-SiBA approach achieves mean Dice similarity\ncoefficients (DSC) of 0.81, which significantly improves 3D segmentation\naccuracy compared with the approaches proposed previously (highest mean DSC at\n0.78 on LesionVis). In summary, by leveraging the limited 2D delineations on\nthe RECIST-slices, P-SiBA is an effective semi-supervised approach to produce\naccurate lesion segmentations in 3D.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Nov 2018 17:32:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-13"}

The dark-field image is\nrelated to small angle scattering and has an interesting property when canning\noriented structures: the recorded signal depends on the relative orientation of\nthe structure in the imaging system. Exactly this property allows to draw\nconclusions about the orientation and to reconstruct the structure. However,\nthe reconstruction is a complex, non-trivial challenge. A lot of research was\nconducted towards this goal in the last years and several reconstruction\nalgorithms were proposed. A key step of the reconstruction algorithm is the\ninversion of a forward projection model. Up until now, only 2-D projection\nmodels are available, with effectively limit the scanning trajectory to a 2-D\nplane. To obtain true 3-D information, this limitation requires to combine\nseveral 2-D scans, which leads to quite complex, impractical acquisitions\nschemes. Furthermore, it is not possible with these models to use 3-D\ntrajectories that might allow simpler protocols, like for example a helical\ntrajectory.

The last result is generalized to the\ntotal self-energy contribution to the levels shift and so to the possible\nbehavior of radiative QED effects with virtual photon exchange near the lower\ncontinuum in the supercritical region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Nov 2018 20:00:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-05"}

Although these object detectors with\nfeature pyramids achieve encouraging results, they have some limitations due to\nthat they only simply construct the feature pyramid according to the inherent\nmulti-scale, pyramidal architecture of the backbones which are actually\ndesigned for object classification task. Newly, in this work, we present a\nmethod called Multi-Level Feature Pyramid Network (MLFPN) to construct more\neffective feature pyramids for detecting objects of different scales. First, we\nfuse multi-level features (i.e. multiple layers) extracted by backbone as the\nbase feature. Second, we feed the base feature into a block of alternating\njoint Thinned U-shape Modules and Feature Fusion Modules and exploit the\ndecoder layers of each u-shape module as the features for detecting objects.\nFinally, we gather up the decoder layers with equivalent scales (sizes) to\ndevelop a feature pyramid for object detection, in which every feature map\nconsists of the layers (features) from multiple levels.

By leveraging the sequential\ndependencies within a path, we allow effective reasoning on paths to infer the\nunderlying rationale of a user-item interaction. Furthermore, we design a new\nweighted pooling operation to discriminate the strengths of different paths in\nconnecting a user with an item, endowing our model with a certain level of\nexplainability.

We here propose a new method in which convolutional neutral networks\n(CNNs) are used to constrain theta and phi of disk galaxies under RPS.

CV-TMLE as originally formulated, consists of averaging usually 10\n(for 10-fold cross-validation) parameter estimates, each of which is performed\non a validation set separate from where the initial fit was trained. The\ntargeting step is usually performed as a pooled regression over all validation\nfolds but in each fold, we separately evaluate any means as well as the\nparameter estimate. One nice thing about CV-TMLE, is that we average 10 plug-in\nestimates so the plug-in quality of preserving the natural parameter bounds is\nrespected. Our adjustment of this procedure also preserves the plug-in\ncharacteristic as well as avoids the donsker condtion. The advantage of our\nprocedure is the implementation of the targeting is identical to that of a\nregular TMLE, once all the validation set initial predictions have been formed.\nIn short, we stack the validation set predictions and pretend as if we have a\nregular TMLE, which is not necessarily quite a plug-in estimator on each fold\nbut overall will perform asymptotically the same and might have some slight\nadvantage, a subject for future research.

We\nalso propose a new encoding scheme based on binary constant weight codes.\nMoreover, an upper bound beating the sphere-packing type bound is given when\n$d$ is relatively close to $n$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2018 08:30:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-13"}

However, in the context of inverse\nproblems, deep neural networks mostly act as black box routines, used for\ninstance for a somewhat unspecified removal of artifacts in classical image\nreconstructions. In this paper, we will focus on the severely ill-posed inverse\nproblem of limited angle computed tomography, in which entire boundary sections\nare not captured in the measurements. We will develop a hybrid reconstruction\nframework that fuses model-based sparse regularization with data-driven deep\nlearning. Our method is reliable in the sense that we only learn the part that\ncan provably not be handled by model-based methods, while applying the\ntheoretically controllable sparse regularization technique to the remaining\nparts. Such a decomposition into visible and invisible segments is achieved by\nmeans of the shearlet transform that allows to resolve wavefront sets in the\nphase space. Furthermore, this split enables us to assign the clear task of\ninferring unknown shearlet coefficients to the neural network and thereby\noffering an interpretation of its performance in the context of limited angle\ncomputed tomography. Our numerical experiments show that our algorithm\nsignificantly surpasses both pure model- and more data-based reconstruction\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2018 08:36:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

First, we analyze the effect of bursts\nand mergers and companion chemical pollution and rejuvenation of the stellar\ncontent on the integrated light emitted by galaxies. The dispersion of the\ngalaxy magnitudes and colors on the $M_V-(B-V)$ plane is mainly due to mixing\nof ages and metallicities of the stellar populations, with mergers weighting\nmore than bursts of similar mass fractions. The analysis is made using the\nMonte-Carlo technique applied to ideal model galaxies reduced to single stellar\npopulations with galaxy-size mass to evaluate mass, age and metallicity of each\nobject. We show that separately determining the contributions by bursts and\nmergers leads to a better understanding of observed properties of CMD of\ncluster galaxies.

Using the halo mass function and the\nMonte-Carlo technique, we derive the formation redshift of each galaxy and its\nphotometric history. These are used to simulate the CMD of the cluster\ngalaxies.

Though a\nfew algorithms overcome this problem by using density-based methods, they tend\nto miss out many biclusters because they use global criteria for identifying\ndense regions. The proposed method, RelDenClu uses the local variations in\nmarginal and joint densities for each pair of features to find the subset of\nobservations, which forms the bases of the relation between them. It then finds\nthe set of features connected by a common set of observations, resulting in a\nbicluster.\n  To show the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, experimentation has\nbeen carried out on fifteen types of simulated datasets. Further, it has been\napplied to six real-life datasets. For three of these real-life datasets, the\nproposed method is used for unsupervised learning, while for other three\nreal-life datasets it is used as an aid to supervised learning. For all the\ndatasets the performance of the proposed method is compared with that of seven\ndifferent state-of-the-art algorithms and the proposed algorithm is seen to\nproduce better results. The efficacy of proposed algorithm is also seen by its\nuse on COVID-19 dataset for identifying some features (genetic, demographics\nand others) that are likely to affect the spread of COVID-19.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2018 11:11:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 May 2019 10:26:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 25 May 2020 17:39:50 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 28 May 2020 09:54:59 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 11 May 2021 11:32:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-12"}

Sleep stage classification was achieved using a Random Forest\n(RF) classifier and 156 features extracted from electroencephalogram (EEG),\nelectrooculogram (EOG) and electromyogram (EMG) channels.

In this context, however, there are\nstill some fundamental questions that remain unanswered with respect to data.\n\\textit{What is meant by data value? How can it be quantified, in a general\nsense?}. The \"value\" of data is not understood quantitatively until it is used\nin an application and output is evaluated, and hence currently it is not\npossible to assess the value of large amounts of data that companies hold,\ncategorically. Further, there is overall consensus that good data is important\nfor any analysis but there is no independent definition of what constitutes\ngood data.\n  In our paper we try to address these gaps in the valuation of data and\npresent a framework for users who wish to assess the value of data in a\ncategorical manner. Our approach is to view the data as composed of various\nattributes or characteristics, which we refer to as facets, and which in turn\ncomprise many sub-facets. We define the notion of values that each sub-facet\nmay take, and provide a seed scoring mechanism for the different values. The\nperson assessing the data is required to fill in the values of the various\nsub-facets that are relevant for the data set under consideration, through a\nquestionnaire that attempts to list them exhaustively. Based on the scores\nassigned for each set of values, the data set can now be quantified in terms of\nits properties. This provides a basis for the comparison of the relative merits\nof two or more data sets in a structured manner, independent of context. The\npresence of context adds additional information that improves the\nquantification of the data value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2018 11:17:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-13"}

We single out pure disorder, by focusing on a series of\nY$_{z}$Eu$_{1-z}$Ba$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+y}$ samples at fixed oxygen content\n$y=0.35$, in the range $0\\le z\\le 1$. The gradual Y/Eu isovalent substitution\nsmoothly drives the system through the Mott-insulator to superconductor\ntransition from a full antiferromagnet with N\\'eel transition $T_N=320$ K at\n$z=0$ to a bulk superconductor with superconducting critical temperature\n$T_c=18$ K at $z=1$, YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6.35}$.

These\nmaterials have three mirror planes in the non-magnetic case, leading to three\nnodal lines near the Fermi level. However, dependent on the orientation of the\nmagnetization, some of the mirror planes are broken and the respective lines\nare gapped, creating large Berry curvature.

This encourages us to learn segmentation by generating realistic\ncomposite images. To achieve this, we propose a novel framework that exploits a\nnew proposed prior called the independence prior based on Generative\nAdversarial Networks (GANs). The generator produces an image with multiple\ncategory-specific instance providers, a layout module and a composition module.\nFirstly, each provider independently outputs a category-specific instance image\nwith a soft mask. Then the provided instances' poses are corrected by the\nlayout module. Lastly, the composition module combines these instances into a\nfinal image. Training with adversarial loss and penalty for mask area, each\nprovider learns a mask that is as small as possible but enough to cover a\ncomplete category-specific instance. Weakly supervised semantic segmentation\nmethods widely use grouping cues modeling the association between image parts,\nwhich are either artificially designed or learned with costly segmentation\nlabels or only modeled on local pairs.

For larger\ncouplings, established for example by (a combination of) Feshbach resonances\nand optical trapping, the MCTDH approach overestimates the depth of the\ntrap-induced correlation dip of first order correlations in position space, as\nwell as overestimates the fragmentation, defined as the average relative\noccupation of orbitals other than the energetically lowest one. We anticipate\nthat qualitatively similar features in the correlation function may arise for\nlarger particle numbers, paving the way for a quantitative assessment of the\naccuracy of MCTDH by experiments with ultracold atoms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2018 13:05:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Oct 2021 17:19:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-29"}

While earlier efforts have advanced the\nunderstanding of the ultrafast cross-layer charge transfer process in 2D\nheterostructures, mechanisms for the interfacial photocarrier recombination\nremain, to a large extent, unclear. Here, we investigate a heterostructure\ncomprised of black phosphorus (BP) and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), with a\ntype-II band alignment. Interestingly, it is found that the photo-generated\nelectrons in MoS2 (transferred from BP) exhibit an ultrafast lifetime of about\n5 ps, significantly shorter than those of the constituent materials. By\ncorroborating with the relaxation of photo-excited holes in BP, it is revealed\nthat the ultrafast time constant is as a result of efficient Langevin\nrecombination, where the high hole mobility of BP facilitates a large\nrecombination coefficient (approximately 2x10^-10 m^2/s). In addition,\nbroadband transient absorption spectroscopy confirms that the hot electrons\ntransferred to MoS2 distribute over a broad energy range following an ultrafast\nthermalization. The rate of the interlayer Langevin recombination is found to\nexhibit no energy level dependence. Our findings provide essential insights\ninto the fundamental photo-physics in type-II 2D heterostructures, and also\nprovide useful guidelines for customizing photocarrier lifetimes of BP for\nhigh-speed photo-sensitive devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2018 13:06:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-13"}

The interaction between both, e.g., the transfer of heat,\nmass, or angular momentum depends on whether and how flows penetrate into the\nstable layer. Powered from the unstable, convective regions, radial flows can\npierce into the stable region depending on their inertia (overshooting). In\nrapidly rotating systems, the dynamics are strongly influenced by the Coriolis\nforce and radial flows penetrate in stratified regions due to the geostrophic\ninvariance of columnar convection even in the limit of vanishing inertia.\nWithin this study, we numerically investigate both mechanisms and hence explore\nthe nature of penetrative convection in rapidly rotating spherical shells. The\nstudy covers a broad range of system parameters, such as the strength of the\nstratification relative to the Coriolis force or the inertia. Guided by the\napplication to Saturn, we model a sandwiched stable stratified layer (SSL)\nsurrounded by two convective zones. A comprehensive analysis of the damping\nbehavior of convective flows at the edges of the SSL showed that the mean\npenetration depth is controlled by the ratio of stratified and unstratified\nbuoyancy gradients and is hence independent of rotation. A scaling law is\nderived and suggests that the penetration depth decreases with the square root\nof the ratio of unstabilizing and stabilizing entropy gradients. The influence\nof the Coriolis force, however, is evident by a modulation of the penetration\ndepth along latitude, since convective columns are elongated vertically and\nhence pierce predominantly into the SSL around mid-latitudes and outside the\ntangent cylinder. Our result also show that the penetration depth decreases\nlinearly with the flow length scale (low pass filter), confirming predictions\nfrom the linear theory of rotating partially stratified convection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2018 13:37:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-13"}

The mutual information is then\nrelated to the so-called density of states of this operator.

So far coloring problems are mostly studied\non static graphs, which often stand in stark contrast to practice where data is\ninherently dynamic and subject to discrete changes over time. A temporal graph\nis a graph whose edges are assigned a set of integer time labels, indicating at\nwhich discrete time steps the edge is active. In this paper we present a\nnatural temporal extension of the classical graph coloring problem. Given a\ntemporal graph and a natural number $\\Delta$, we ask for a coloring sequence\nfor each vertex such that (i) in every sliding time window of $\\Delta$\nconsecutive time steps, in which an edge is active, this edge is properly\ncolored (i.e. its endpoints are assigned two different colors) at least once\nduring that time window, and (ii) the total number of different colors is\nminimized. This sliding window temporal coloring problem abstractly captures\nmany realistic graph coloring scenarios in which the underlying network changes\nover time, such as dynamically assigning communication channels to moving\nagents. We present a thorough investigation of the computational complexity of\nthis temporal coloring problem.

Constant sample complexity means that the mechanism\n(potentially randomized) only uses a constant number of ordinal queries\nregardless of the number of voters and alternatives. Squared Distortion is a\nmeasure of variance of the Distortion of a randomized mechanism.\n  Our primary contribution is the first social choice mechanism with constant\nsample complexity \\textit{and} constant Squared Distortion (which also implies\nconstant Distortion).

Wavelet-based analyses have been\nable to unambiguously determine both the number of spiral arms and the rotation\nrate of many of these patterns. However, there are many more planetary normal\nmodes that should have resonances in the rings, implying that many normal modes\ndo not have sufficiently large amplitudes to generate obvious ring waves.\nFortunately, recent advances in wavelet analysis allow weaker wave signals to\nbe uncovered by combining data from multiple occultations.

We aim at characterizing the\nstar-disk interaction and the accretion process onto the central star of LkCa\n15, a transition disk system with an inner dust cavity. We obtained\nquasi-simultaneous photometric and spectropolarimetric observations of the\nsystem over several rotational periods. We analyzed the system light curve, as\nwell as changes in spectral continuum and line profile to derive the properties\nof the accretion flow from the edge of the inner disk to the central star. We\nalso derived magnetic field measurements at the stellar surface. We find that\nthe system exhibits magnetic, photometric, and spectroscopic variability with a\nperiod of about 5.70 days. The light curve reveals a periodic dip, which\nsuggests the presence of an inner disk warp that is located at the corotation\nradius at about 0.06 au from the star. Line profile variations and veiling\nvariability are consistent with a magnetospheric accretion model where the\nfunnel flows reach the star at high latitudes. This leads to the development of\nan accretion shock close to the magnetic poles. All diagnostics point to a\nhighly inclined inner disk that interacts with the stellar magnetosphere. The\nspectroscopic and photometric variability of LkCa 15 is remarkably similar to\nthat of AA Tau, the prototype of periodic dippers. We therefore suggest that\nthe origin of the variability is a rotating disk warp that is located at the\ninner edge of a highly inclined disk close to the star. This contrasts with the\nmoderate inclination of the outer transition disk seen on the large scale and\nthus provides evidence for a significant misalignment between the inner and\nouter disks of this planet-forming transition disk system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2018 15:39:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-26"}

Specifically, we first apply a proposed multi-modal aspect-aware\ntopic model (MATM) on text reviews and item images to model users' preferences\nand items' features from different aspects, and also estimate the aspect\nimportance of a user towards an item. Then the aspect importance is integrated\ninto a novel aspect-aware latent factor model (ALFM), which learns user's and\nitem's latent factors based on ratings. In particular, ALFM introduces a weight\nmatrix to associate those latent factors with the same set of aspects in MATM,\nsuch that the latent factors could be used to estimate aspect ratings. Finally,\nthe overall rating is computed via a linear combination of the aspect ratings,\nwhich are weighted by the corresponding aspect importance.

Besides, every aspect rating is weighted by its aspect\nimportance, which is dependent on the targeted user's preferences and the\ntargeted item's features.

We demonstrate the application of these\nmethods with a case study using field data, and make the first ever detection\nof the critically endangered riverine rabbit (Bunolagus monticularis) in\nthermal infrared data. We provide a web-tool so that the community can easily\napply these techniques to other studies\n(http://www.astro.ljmu.ac.uk/~aricburk/uav_calc/).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2018 10:36:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

Here, we assess the potential of a\nmulti-branch transmitter (MBT) and its use to achieve higher data rates in\nsingle user and multiuser indoor VLC systems. For the single user VLC system,\nthe performance of the MBT is examined with a wide field of view (W-FOV)\nreceiver and an angle diversity receiver (ADR) while for the multiuser VLC\nsystem we evaluate the performance of the MBT with a non-imaging angle\ndiversity receiver (NI-ADR). In addition, for the multiuser VLC system, we\npropose subcarrier multiplexing (SCM) tones to allocate an optimum transmitter\nto each user. Furthermore, wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) is examined\nto support higher data rates for each user while using on-off-keying (OOK)\nmodulation. In addition, the impact of the user's mobility on the multi-user\nVLC system performance is studied. The effect of diffuse reflections, mobility\nand lighting constraints are taken into account. In addition, the effect of\nco-channel interference (CCI) is considered in the multiuser VLC system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2018 10:33:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 17 Aug 2019 21:42:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-20"}

Here, we use\ncomputer generated holograms (CGHs) in VLC system design to improve the\nachievable system data rate. The CGHs are utilized to produce a fixed broad\nbeam from the light source, selecting the light source that offers the best\nperformance. The CGHs direct this beam to a specific zone on the room's\ncommunication floor where the receiver is located. This reduces the effect of\ndiffuse reflections. Consequently, decreasing the intersymbol interference\n(ISI) and enabling the VLC indoor channel to support higher data rates. We\nconsider two settings to examine our propose VLC system and consider lighting\nconstraints. We evaluate the performance in idealistic and realistic room\nsetting in a diffuse environment with up to second order reflections and also\nunder mobility. The results show that using the CGHs enhances the 3dB bandwidth\nof the VLC channel and improves the received optical power.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2018 10:42:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-18"}
