We prove that every (unbounded-depth) circuit of size $s$ can be\nexpressed as an OR of $2^{s/3.9}$ $16$-CNFs.

We present a detailed analysis of this technique within the\npost-Newtonian framework and perform some simulations of its performance using\nrealistic satellite orbits and the state-of-the-art fiber technology at the\ntelecom wavelength of 1550 nm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2018 16:25:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Jan 2019 16:13:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2019 09:05:51 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2023 10:37:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-15"}

Among the parameters that\nare constrained by transiting exoplanet lightcurves, there are two which are of\nmuch physical significance: the impact parameter of the orbit, $b = (a/R_*)\\cos\ni $, and the planet-to-star radius ratio, $p = R_p/R_s$ (which defines the\ntransit depth, $\\delta = p^2$).

Volatile loss through bombardment is typically\n20% for Miranda, a few percents for the larger Uranian satellites and\nnegligible for the Galilean satellites. Due to its small size and the high\nimpact velocity there is a >99% chance that Miranda suffered a catastrophic\nimpact that shattered the satellite. Subsequent re-accretion from a\ncircum-Uranian ring could account for its peculiar surface morphology and low\ndensity. The probability to destroy Ariel and Umbriel is 15% and 1% for Titania\nand Oberon. Approximately 90% of the mass in planetesimals that passes through\nthe Jovian and Uranian satellite systems (about $4 {\\rm \\ M_{\\oplus}}$ and $2\n{\\rm \\ M_{\\oplus}}$ respectively) does so in about 15 Myr.

TRAPPIST-1 is an ultra-cool\ndwarf, host to seven transiting planets, and contains its own molecular\nsignatures which can potentially be imprinted on planetary transit lightcurves\ndue to inhomogeneities in the occulted stellar photosphere. We present a case\nstudy on TRAPPIST-1g, the largest planet in the system, using a new observation\ntogether with previous data, to disentangle the atmospheric transmission of the\nplanet from that of the star. We use the out-of-transit stellar spectra to\nreconstruct the stellar flux based on one-, two-, and three-temperature\ncomponents. We find that TRAPPIST-1 is a 0.08 M$_*$, 0.117 R$_*$, M8V star with\na photospheric effective temperature of 2400 K, with ~35% 3000 K spot coverage\nand a very small fraction, <3%, of ~5800 K hot spot.

The simulations show that the integrated polarization is rather\nsmall, usually $< 0.01$ per cent for typical masses detected by their\nfar-infrared excess for hot and most warm disks. Masses observed in cold disks\ncan produce polarization levels above $0.01$ per cent since there is usually\nmore dust in them than in closer disks.

However, we\nlack general methods for estimating the causal effect of lexical choice on the\nperception of a specific sentence. While randomized controlled trials may\nprovide good estimates, they do not scale to the potentially millions of\ncomparisons necessary to consider all lexical choices. Instead, in this paper,\nwe first offer two classes of methods to estimate the effect on perception of\nchanging one word to another in a given sentence. The first class of algorithms\nbuilds upon quasi-experimental designs to estimate individual treatment effects\nfrom observational data. The second class treats treatment effect estimation as\na classification problem.

Furthermore, for magnetic fields oriented along the\nnanowire axis, $g_{exc}$ is nearly three times larger than in bulk zincblende\nInP and it shows a marked sublinear dependence on the magnetic field, a common\nfeature to other non-nitride III-V wurtzite nanowires but not properly\nunderstood. Remarkably, this nonlinearity originates from only one Zeeman\nbranch characterized by a specific type of light polarization. All the\nexperimental findings are modeled theoretically by a robust approach combining\nthe $k \\cdot p$ method with the envelope function approximation and including\nthe electron-hole interaction. We revealed that the nonlinear features arise\ndue to the coupling between Landau levels pertaining to the A (heavy-hole like)\nand B (light-hole like) valence bands of the wurtzite crystal structure. This\ngeneral behavior is particularly relevant for the understanding of the spin\nproperties of several wurtzite nanowires that host the set for the observation\nof topological phases potentially at the base of quantum computing platforms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2018 16:51:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-01"}

The outflows suppress any accretion for\napproximately a dynamical time. The gas then cools, recombines and falls back\nto the centre where high accretion rates are again observed. The overall effect\nis to create an effective accretion rate with values of between 0.1 and 0.5\ntimes the Eddington rate. If this episodic accretion rate is maintained for\norder 500 million years then the black hole will increase in mass by a factor\nof between 3 and 300 but far short of the factor of $10^4$ required for the\nseeds to become the SMBHs observed at $z>6$. Therefore, direct collapse black\nholes born into atomic cooling haloes and which experience strong negative\nmechanical feedback will require external influences (e.g. rapid major mergers\nwith other haloes) to promote efficient accretion and reach SMBH masses within\na few hundred million years.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2018 19:00:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Apr 2019 10:06:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-24"}

The latter mainly consists of a torus of dense\nclumps and streams of molecular gas (the circumnuclear disk, CND) enclosing\nstreamers of ionized gas (the Minispiral). In this complex environment,\nknowledge of the local extinction that locally affects each feature is crucial\nto properly study and disentangle them. We previously studied molecular gas in\nthis region and inferred an extinction map from two H2 lines. Extinction\nappears to be correlated with the dereddened flux in several contiguous areas\nin the field of view. Here, we discuss the origin of this local correlation. We\nmodel the observed effect with a simple radiative transfer model. H2 emission\narises from the surfaces of clumps (i.e., shells) that are exposed to the\nambient ultraviolet (UV) radiation field. We consider the shell at the surface\nof an emitting clump. The shell has a varying optical depth and a screen of\ndust in front of it. The optical depth varies from one line of sight to\nanother, either because of varying extinction coefficient from the shell of one\nclump to that of another or because of a varying number of identical clumps on\nthe line of sight. In both scenarios, the model accurately reproduces the\ndependence of molecular gas emission and extinction. The reason for this\ncorrelation is that, in the central parsec, the molecular gas is mixed\neverywhere with dust that locally affects the observed gas emission. In\naddition, there is extinction due to foreground (screen) dust. This analysis\nfavors a scenario where the central parsec is filled with clumps of dust and\nmolecular gas. Separating foreground from local extinction allows for a probe\nfor local conditions (H2 is mixed with dust) and can also constrain the\nthree-dimensional (3D) position of objects under study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2018 19:14:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-16"}

For quantum reset processes we show that the unravelled dynamics is\nsemi-Markov, and derive bounds on the asymptotic variance of the number of\nquantum jumps which generalise classical thermodynamic uncertainty relations.\nWe finish by discussing how our level-2.5 approach can be used to study large\ndeviations of non-linear functions of the state such as measures of\nentanglement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2018 19:19:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-10"}

Much of the oxygen produced over cosmic time by the galaxy's stars\nalso ends up there. The resulting absorption lines in the spectra of UV and\nX-ray background sources are powerful diagnostics of the feedback processes\nthat prevent more of those baryons from forming stars. This paper presents\npredictions for CGM absorption lines (O VI, O VII, O VIII, Ne VIII, N V) that\nare based on precipitation-regulated feedback models, which posit that the\nradiative cooling time of the ambient medium cannot drop much below 10 times\nthe freefall time without triggering a strong feedback event. The resulting\npredictions align with many different observational constraints on the Milky\nWay's ambient CGM and explain why N_OVI ~ 10^14 cm^-2 over large ranges in halo\nmass and projected radius. Within the precipitation framework, the strongest\nO~VI absorption lines result from vertical mixing of the CGM that raises\nlow-entropy ambient gas to greater altitudes, because adiabatic cooling of the\nuplifted gas then lowers its temperature and raises the fractional abundance of\nO^5+. Condensation stimulated by uplift may also produce associated\nlow-ionization components. The observed velocity structure of the O VI\nabsorption suggests that galactic outflows do not expel circumgalactic gas at\nthe halo's escape velocity but rather drive circulation that dissipates much of\nthe galaxy's supernova energy within the ambient medium, causing some of it to\nexpand beyond the virial radius.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2018 19:32:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-14"}

Coupled with their high compliance and response lag, PMAs\nare challenging to control, particularly when subjected to external loads. The\nhysteresis models proposed to-date rely on many physical and mechanical\nparameters that are difficult to measure reliably and therefore of limited use\nfor implementing dynamic control. In this work, we employ a Bouc-Wen hysteresis\nmodeling approach to account for the hysteresis of PMAs and use the model for\nimplementing dynamic control.

The dynamic control\nbased on the Bouc-Wen hysteresis model shows significantly better tracking\nperformance.

In electron-doped cuprate Nd2-xCexCuO4 (NCCO), an unexpected\nFS reconstruction has been observed in optimal- and over-doped regime\n(x=0.15-0.17) by quantum oscillation measurements (QOM). This is all the more\npuzzling because neutron scattering suggests that the antiferromagnetic (AFM)\nlong-range order, which is believed to reconstruct the FS, vanishes before\nx=0.14. To reconcile the conflict, a widely discussed external magnetic\nfield-induced AFM long-range order in QOM explains the FS reconstruction as an\nextrinsic property. Here, we report angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES)\nevidence of FS reconstruction in optimal- and over-doped NCCO.

Because of the unusual dense environment of clusters,\ntheir evolution is driven by different mechanisms than the ones affecting field\nor central galaxies. Understanding the different interactions they are subject\nto, and how they are influenced by them, is therefore an important step towards\nexplaining the global picture of galaxy evolution. In this paper, we use the\npublicly-available high resolution hydrodynamical simulation Illustris-1 to\nstudy satellite galaxies in the three most massive host haloes (with masses\n$M_{200} > 10^{14}\\,h^{-1}\\rm{M}_{\\odot}$) at $z=0$. We measure the\nStellar-to-Halo Mass Relation (hereafter SHMR) of the galaxies, and find that\nfor satellites it is shifted towards lower halo masses compared to the SHMR of\ncentral galaxies. We provide simple fitting functions for both the central and\nsatellite SHMR. To explain the shift between the two, we follow the satellite\ngalaxies since their time of accretion into the clusters, and quantify the\nimpact of dark matter stripping and star formation. We find that subhaloes\nstart losing their dark matter as soon as they get closer than $\\sim 1.5\\times\nR_{\\rm{vir}}$ to the centre of their host, and that up to 80\\% of their dark\nmatter content gets stripped during infall.

The combination of these two effects impacts the ratio of\nstellar to dark matter mass which varies drastically during infall, from 0.03\nto 0.3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2018 20:42:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2018 16:08:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 9 May 2019 10:12:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-22"}

In the present study, we propose\nan original approach based on mean mass entrainment, which is the driving\nmechanism accounting for the growth of the separated shear layer. The focus is\non mass transfer at the Turbulent/Non-Turbulent Interface (TNTI). In\nparticular, the scaling of the TNTI, which is well documented in turbulent\nboundary layers, is used to trace changes in the scaling properties of the\nflow. To emphasise the influence of the incoming boundary layer, two\ngeometrically similar, descending ramps with sizeably different heights $h$ but\nfundamentally similar values of $\\delta_e$ are compared. The distribution in\nspace of the TNTI highlights a sizeable footprint of the incoming boundary\nlayer on the separated flow, the scaling of which results of the competition\nbetween $h$ and $\\delta_e$. On the basis of a simple mass budget within the\nneighbourhood of separation, we propose to model this competition by\nintroducing the scaling factor $C_{h,\\delta} = 1 + \\delta_e/h$.

Second,\nin order to prove the strong convergence of the proposed fully discrete finite\nelement method, stability estimates for higher order moments of the\n$H^1$-seminorm of the numerical solution must be established, which are\ndifficult and delicate. A judicious combination of the properties of the drift\nand diffusion terms and a nontrivial technique borrowed from [16] is used in\nthis paper to achieve the goal. Finally, stability estimates for the second and\nhigher order moments of the $L^2$-norm of the numerical solution is also\ndifficult to obtain due to the fact that the mass matrix may not be diagonally\ndominant. This is done by utilizing the interpolation theory and the higher\nmoment estimates for the $H^1$-seminorm of the numerical solution. After\novercoming these difficulties, it is proved that the proposed fully discrete\nfinite element method is convergent in strong norms with nearly optimal rates\nof convergence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2018 22:44:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2018 19:59:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-22"}

This is related to a shadow Hamiltonian,\nwhich coincides with the specified Hamiltonian only when the time-step size\napproaches zero.

In the case of linear springs, natural dynamics is a\ntraditional method for this design, but it has two major limitations: arbitrary\nload trajectories are difficult or impossible to analyze and it does not\nconsider actuator constraints. Parametric optimization is also a popular design\nmethod that addresses these limitations, but solutions are only optimal within\nthe space of the parameters. To overcome these limitations, we propose a\nnon-parametric convex optimization program for the design of the nonlinear\nelastic element that minimizes energy consumption and peak power for an\narbitrary periodic reference trajectory. To obtain convexity, we introduce a\nconvex approximation to the expression of peak power; energy consumption is\nshown to be convex without approximation. The combination of peak power and\nenergy consumption in the cost function leads to a multiobjective convex\noptimization framework that comprises the main contribution of this paper.

Specifically, it is not clear if or how particular\ncharacteristics within the kinematic execution of gestures capture attention\nand aid in the classification of gestures with communicative intent. If indeed\nkey features of gestures with perceptual saliency exist, such features could\nhelp form the basis of a compact representation of the gestures in memory.\nMethods: This study used a set of available gesture videos as stimuli. The\ntiming for salient features of performed gestures was determined by isolating\ninflection points in the hands' motion trajectories. Participants passively\nviewed the gesture videos while continuous EEG data was collected. We focused\non mu oscillations (10 Hz) and used linear regression to test for associations\nbetween the timing of mu oscillations and inflection points in motion\ntrajectories. Results: Peaks in the EEG signals at central and occipital\nelectrodes were used to isolate the salient events within each gesture. EEG\npower oscillations were detected 343 and 400ms on average after inflection\npoints at occipital and central electrodes, respectively.

However, the\noutstanding performance of DNNs notoriously relies on increasingly complex\nmodels, which in turn is associated with an increase in computational expense\nfar surpassing mobile devices' capacity. What is worse, app service providers\nneed to collect and utilize a large volume of users' data, which contain\nsensitive information, to build the sophisticated DNN models. Directly\ndeploying these models on public mobile devices presents prohibitive privacy\nrisk. To benefit from the on-device deep learning without the capacity and\nprivacy concerns, we design a private model compression framework RONA.\nFollowing the knowledge distillation paradigm, we jointly use hint learning,\ndistillation learning, and self learning to train a compact and fast neural\nnetwork. The knowledge distilled from the cumbersome model is adaptively\nbounded and carefully perturbed to enforce differential privacy.

A series of empirical evaluations as well\nas the implementation on an Android mobile device show that RONA can not only\ncompress cumbersome models efficiently but also provide a strong privacy\nguarantee. For example, on SVHN, when a meaningful\n$(9.83,10^{-6})$-differential privacy is guaranteed, the compact model trained\nby RONA can obtain 20$\\times$ compression ratio and 19$\\times$ speed-up with\nmerely 0.97% accuracy loss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2018 02:21:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}

These speckles are caused by\naberrations, called non-common path aberrations (NCPA), that are not corrected\nin the adaptive optics loop, and all attempts to subtract them in\npost-processing have been problematic. The method of Frazin (2013) (F13) uses\nsimultaneous millisecond telemetry from wavefront sensor (WFS) and the SC to\nestimate the both the NCPA and the exoplanet image in a self-consistent manner.\nRodack et al. (2018) proposed correcting for the NCPA in real-time while on-sky\nusing the F13 estimation method, and called this procedure the \"Real-Time\nFrazin Algorithm.\" The original regression model underlying the F13 method did\nnot account for uncertainty in the WFS measurements, and this cannot be done\nwith standard statistical methodology since these uncertainties manifest\nthemselves in the independent variables (i.e., they cannot be treated as\nanother source of noise in the SC data). Further, simulations show that simply\nusing the noisy wavefront measurements without accounting for their\nuncertainties leads to estimates of the NCPA with unacceptably large bias.\nHere, the source of this bias is explained in terms of an \"errors in variables\"\nstatistical model. Then, the method of F13 is generalized to account for WFS\nmeasurement error using a new sequential estimation technique that treats the\nnonlinear coupling between NCPA, WFS measurements and the error covariance of\nthe WFS measurements. This new technique keeps a running estimate of the NCPA,\nthe exoplanet image and their joint covariance matrix. The sequential\nimplementation of the method should make it computationally efficient enough to\nbe suitable for on-sky correction of the NCPA as well as off-line analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2018 04:32:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}

In this study, we focus on a specific type of\ntriadic social structure, the buddy relation, which can be described as a\nrelationship through which project founder x, who previously backed another\nfounder z's project, receives financial backing from the other backers of z's\nproject. We found that the buddy relation occurs significantly more often than\nrandomly, concluding that this structure facilitates the gathering of financial\nbacking and may contribute to the success of a crowdfunded project.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2018 04:53:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Nov 2018 01:11:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-19"}

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to allow a learning agent to\nask what it considers as tricky to predict, in the course of producing a final\noutput. By analyzing when and what it asks, we can make our model more\ntransparent and interpretable. We first develop this idea to propose a general\nframework of deep neural networks that can ask questions, which we call asking\nnetworks. A specific architecture and training process for an asking network is\nproposed for the task of colorization, which is an exemplar one-to-many task\nand thus a task where asking questions is helpful in performing the task\naccurately. Our results show that the model learns to generate meaningful\nquestions, asks difficult questions first, and utilizes the provided hint more\nefficiently than baseline models. We conclude that the proposed asking\nframework makes the learning agent reveal its weaknesses, which poses a\npromising new direction in developing interpretable and interactive models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2018 04:57:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}

Traditional RNNs usually treat each\ntoken in a sentence uniformly and equally.

Since semantic structures such as word dependence patterns\nare not parameterized, it is a challenge to capture and leverage structure\ninformation.

Concretely, MC-RNN contains multiple channels, each of\nwhich represents a local dependence pattern at a time. An attention mechanism\nis introduced to combine these patterns at each step, according to the semantic\ninformation. Then we parameterize structure information by adaptively selecting\nthe most appropriate connection structures among channels.

With suitable parametrization of the signal sparsity and\nmagnitude of its non-zero components, we characterize a phase-transition\nphenomenon akin to the signal detection problem studied by Ingster in 1998.\nSpecifically, if the signal magnitude is above the so-called strong\nclassification boundary, we show that several classes of well-known procedures\nachieve asymptotically perfect support recovery as the dimension goes to\ninfinity. This is so, for a very broad class of error distributions with light,\nrapidly varying tails which may have arbitrary dependence. Conversely, if the\nsignal is below the boundary, then for a very broad class of error dependence\nstructures, no thresholding estimators (including ones with data-dependent\nthresholds) can achieve perfect support recovery. The proofs of these results\nexploit a certain concentration of maxima phenomenon known as relative\nstability. We provide a complete characterization of the relative stability\nphenomenon for Gaussian triangular arrays in terms their correlation structure.\nThe proof uses classic Sudakov-Fernique and Slepian lemma arguments along with\na curious application of Ramsey's coloring theorem.\n  We note that our study of the strong classification boundary is in a finer,\npoint-wise, rather than minimax, sense.

In the present paper,\nwe study the fate of this topological invariant when inversion symmetry is\nadded while time-reversal symmetry is not enforced. There are two ways to add\ninversion symmetry, leading to space groups No.~13 and No.~14. In space group\nNo.~13, we find that the glide-$Z_2$ invariant is expressed solely from the\nirreducible representations at high-symmetry points in $k$-space.

In state-of-the-art\ntechniques the gender is determined by examining dimensions of the bones of\nskull and the pelvis area. In worse situations when there is only a small\nportion of the human remains to be investigated and the subject is a child, we\nneed alternative techniques to determine the gender of the subject. In this\nwork we propose a technique called GDCNN (Gender Determination with\nConvolutional Neural Networks), where the left hand radio-graphs of the\nchildren between a wide range of ages in 1 month to 18 years are examined to\ndetermine the gender. To our knowledge this technique is first of its kind.\nFurther to identify the area of the attention we used Class Activation Mapping\n(CAM). Results: The results suggest the accuracy of the model is as high as\n98%, which is very convincing by taking into account the incompletely grown\nskeleton of the children. The attention observed with CAM discovers that the\nlower part of the hand around carpals (wrist) is more important for child\ngender determination.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2018 09:43:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}

In\nthis work, we first point out that the essential effect of the two disharmonies\ncan be summarized in term of the gradient. Further, we propose a novel gradient\nharmonizing mechanism (GHM) to be a hedging for the disharmonies. The\nphilosophy behind GHM can be easily embedded into both classification loss\nfunction like cross-entropy (CE) and regression loss function like smooth-$L_1$\n($SL_1$) loss. To this end, two novel loss functions called GHM-C and GHM-R are\ndesigned to balancing the gradient flow for anchor classification and bounding\nbox refinement, respectively. Ablation study on MS COCO demonstrates that\nwithout laborious hyper-parameter tuning, both GHM-C and GHM-R can bring\nsubstantial improvement for single-stage detector.

Such strongly correlated systems can be realized\nand tested in ultracold atoms experiments. Their non-trivial permutational\nsymmetry properties are investigated, as well as their interplay with\ncorrelations. Exploiting an exact solution at strong interactions, we extract\ngeneral correlation properties encoded in the one-body density matrix and in\nthe associated momentum distributions, in fermionic and Bose-Fermi mixtures. In\nparticular, we obtain substantial results about the short-range behavior, and\ntherefore the high-momentum tails, which display typical $k^{-4}$ laws. The\nweights of these tails, denoted as Tan's contacts, are related to numerous\nthermodynamic properties of the systems such as the two-body correlations, the\nderivative of the energy with respect to the one-dimensional scattering length,\nor the static structure factor. We show that these universal Tan's contacts\nalso allow to characterize the spatial symmetry of the systems, and therefore\nis a deep connection between correlations and symmetries. Besides, the exchange\nsymmetry is extracted using a group theory method, namely the class-sum method,\nwhich comes originally from nuclear physics. Moreover, we show that these\nsystems follow a generalized version of the famous Lieb-Mattis theorem. Wishing\nto make our results as experimentally relevant as possible, we derive scaling\nlaws for Tan's contact as a function of the interaction, temperature and\ntransverse confinement. These laws display interesting effects related to\nstrong correlations and dimensionality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2018 11:01:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}

The key structural properties, in particular related to the\nring statistics, could be numerically reproduced by performing molecular\ndynamics simulations with an appropriately chosen 2D force field. Using a\nmaximum entropy formulation it is shown that the probability distribution of\nthe individual rings and triplets can be related to the ring and triplet\nenergies, respectively, obtained from the simulations. Using additional\nLagrange parameters, the correct average properties of random networks are\nguaranteed. In agreement with previous work, based on distributions of\ncomplementary rings and triplets, respectively, one finds a Boltzmann-type\nrelation albeit with an effective temperature which largely deviates from the\nbath temperature. Furthermore, it is shown that the ring and triplet energies\ncan be estimated based on the properties of their average inner angles. This\ncalculation supports, on a quantitative level, the previously suggested angle\nmismatch theory. It suggests that correlations among adjacent rings originate\nfrom the net mismatch in the inner ring angles in a triplet of rings. By taking\ninto account an average effect from the surrounding rings of a triplet, an even\nbetter estimate of the correlations can be provided.

Two\nphysical processes that are thought to be the dominant contributors to the\nbrightness surge are shadow hiding (SH) and coherent backscatter (CB). The\noccurrence of shadow hiding in planetary regoliths is self-evident, but it has\nproved difficult to unambiguously demonstrate CB from remote sensing\nobservations. One prediction of CB theory is the wavelength dependence of the\nOE angular width. The Dawn spacecraft observed the OE on the surface of dwarf\nplanet Ceres. We characterize the OE over the resolved surface, including the\nbright Cerealia Facula, and to find evidence for SH and/or CB. We analyze\nimages of the Dawn framing camera by means of photometric modeling of the phase\ncurve. We find that the OE of most of the investigated surface has very similar\ncharacteristics, with an enhancement factor of 1.4 and a FWHM of 3{\\deg} (broad\nOE). A notable exception are the fresh ejecta of the Azacca crater, which\ndisplay a very narrow brightness enhancement that is restricted to phase angles\n$< 0.5${\\deg} (narrow OE); suggestively, this is in the range in which CB is\nthought to dominate. We do not find a wavelength dependence for the width of\nthe broad OE, and lack the data to investigate the dependence for the narrow\nOE. The prediction of a wavelength-dependent CB width is rather ambiguous. The\nzero-phase observations allow us to determine Ceres' visible geometric albedo\nas $p_V = 0.094 \\pm 0.005$. A comparison with other asteroids suggests that\nCeres' broad OE is typical for an asteroid of its spectral type, with\ncharacteristics that are primarily linked to surface albedo. Our analysis\nsuggests that CB may occur on the dark surface of Ceres in a highly localized\nfashion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2018 11:22:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-19"}

While the work of Kumar \\emph{et al} was\nconfined mostly to the plateau at $1/3$-filling (magnetisation per site) in the\nXY regime, we analyse the role of inter-spinon interactions in shaping the\nphases around this plateau in the entire XXZ model. The RG phase diagram\nobtained contains three spin liquid phases whose position is determined as a\nfunction of the exchange anisotropy and the energy scale for fluctuations\narising from spinon scattering. Two of these spins liquids are topologically\nordered states of matter with gapped, degenerate states on the torus. The gap\nfor one of these phases corresponds to the one-spinon band gap of the\nAzbel-Hofstadter spectrum for the XY part of the Hamiltonian, while the other\narises from two-spinon interactions. The Heisenberg point of this problem is\nfound to lie within the interaction gapped spin liquid phase, in broad\nagreement with a recent experimental finding. The third phase is an algebraic\nspin liquid with a gapless Dirac spectrum for spinon excitations, and possess\nproperties that show departures from the Fermi liquid paradigm.

The mixing-length\nparameter, $\\alpha$, is a key factor for the near-surface structure. In the\nconvection formulations used in evolution codes, the $\\alpha$ is a free\nparameter that needs to be properly specified. We calibrated $\\alpha$ values by\nmatching entropy profiles of 1D envelope models with those of 3D CO$^5$BOLD\nmodels.

However, the higher\nentropy target gains more angular momentum than the lower entropy target since\nthe higher entropy target has more expanded envelope. We discuss the efficiency\nof angular momentum transport and the amount of the ejected mass and find a\nsimple analytical model to roughly reproduce the outcomes of numerical\nsimulations. We suggest the range of possible initial conditions for the giant\nimpact on proto-Uranus that reproduces the present rotation tilt of Uranus and\nsufficiently provides the total angular momentum of the satellite system that\ncan be created from the fragments from the giant impact.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2018 11:52:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-26"}

When we use mesh-free methods\nwith high spatial orders, the order of the time integration should also be\nhigh. If we use usual Runge-Kutta schemes, we need to perform the interaction\ncalculation multiple times per one time step. One way to reduce the number of\ninteraction calculations is to use Hermite schemes, which use the time\nderivatives of the right hand side of differential equations, since Hermite\nschemes require smaller number of interaction calculations than RK schemes do\nto achieve the same order. In this paper, we construct a Hermite scheme for a\nmesh-free method with high spatial orders. We performed several numerical tests\nwith fourth-order Hermite schemes and Runge-Kutta schemes. We found that, for\nboth of Hermite and Runge-Kutta schemes, the overall error is determined by the\nerror of spatial derivatives, for timesteps smaller than the stability limit.\nThe calculation cost at the timestep size of the stability limit is smaller for\nHermite schemes. Therefore, we conclude that Hermite schemes are more efficient\nthan Runge-Kutta schemes and thus useful for high-order mesh-free methods for\nLagrangian Hydrodynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2018 11:55:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2018 14:51:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-26"}

Most importantly, our proposed detector can flexibly control the\nFAR by simply adjusting two introduced parameters, which facilitates to\nregulate detector's sensitivity to the outliers incurred by the sea spikes and\nto fairly evaluate the performance of different detection algorithms.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our proposed detector significantly\nimproves the detection probability over several existing classical detectors in\nboth low signal to clutter ratio (SCR) (up to 58%) and low FAR (up to 40%)\ncases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2018 12:30:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

Thus, an experiment of a\nRobotic fly at Reynolds number of 240 was designed to address how insects\ncontrol the flow patterns to modulate the flight forces by the smart wing\nrotation. Experimental results demonstrated that the flow pattern during a half\nof stroke is featured by the formation of a spiral LEV, which has a convex\nshape and connects to the trailing vortex via a tip vortex and a root vortex to\nform a vortex loop. Through wing rotation, the formation of LEV is enhanced and\nthe pinch-off of LEV can be significantly delayed, resulting in the\nstabilization of LEV and the generation of unconventional forces. In addition,\nby modulating the modes of wing rotation, insects obtain distinct wing-vortex\npatterns including positive, neutral, and negative camber patterns, by which\ninsects control the magnitude and direction of unconventional forces owing to\nthe wake capture mechanism. Therefore, the smart wing rotation not only\ncontributes to the generation of unconventional forces, but also accounts for\nthe control of flow pattern during insects steering maneuvers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2018 13:16:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Jun 2019 03:11:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-19"}

Advanced techniques for binary\nsimilarity recently gained momentum as they can be applied in several fields,\nsuch as copyright disputes, malware analysis, vulnerability detection, etc.,\nand thus have an immediate practical impact. Current solutions compare\nfunctions by first transforming their binary code in multi-dimensional vector\nrepresentations (embeddings), and then comparing vectors through simple and\nefficient geometric operations. However, embeddings are usually derived from\nbinary code using manual feature extraction, that may fail in considering\nimportant function characteristics, or may consider features that are not\nimportant for the binary similarity problem. In this paper we propose SAFE, a\nnovel architecture for the embedding of functions based on a self-attentive\nneural network. SAFE works directly on disassembled binary functions, does not\nrequire manual feature extraction, is computationally more efficient than\nexisting solutions (i.e., it does not incur in the computational overhead of\nbuilding or manipulating control flow graphs), and is more general as it works\non stripped binaries and on multiple architectures.

We propose a novel self-supervised learning approach for\npredicting the omnidirectional depth and camera motion from a 360{\\deg} video.\nIn particular, starting from the SfMLearner, which is designed for cameras with\nnormal field-of-view, we introduce three key features to process 360{\\deg}\nimages efficiently. Firstly, we convert each image from equirectangular\nprojection to cubic projection in order to avoid image distortion. In each\nnetwork layer, we use Cube Padding (CP), which pads intermediate features from\nadjacent faces, to avoid image boundaries. Secondly, we propose a novel\n\"spherical\" photometric consistency constraint on the whole viewing sphere. In\nthis way, no pixel will be projected outside the image boundary which typically\nhappens in images with normal field-of-view. Finally, rather than naively\nestimating six independent camera motions (i.e., naively applying SfM-Learner\nto each face on a cube), we propose a novel camera pose consistency loss to\nensure the estimated camera motions reaching consensus.

From the radial\nseparation of the partial propeller gaps we estimate the Hill radius of Bleriot\nto be about 400m. Further, we fit the analytic solution from Sremcevic et al.\n(2002) describing the azimuthal evolution of the surface mass density in the\npropeller gap region to the azimuthal gap evolution obtained from Cassini\nimages. From these fits, we estimate a kinematic shear viscosity in the range\nof 60 cm$^2$/s to 100 cm$^2$/s in Bleriot's ring region. These values are\nconsistent with the parametrization given by Daisaka et al. (2001) and agree\nwell with values estimated for the Encke gap edge (Tajeddine et al. 2017;\nGraetz et al. 2018).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2018 14:34:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}

The well-known\nM\\\"uller-Liu procedure is based on Liu's lemma for linear systems. While the\nM\\\"uller-Liu algorithm works well for basic models with simple constitutive\ndependencies, it cannot take into account nonlinear relationships that exist\nbetween higher derivatives of the fields in the cases of more complex\nconstitutive dependencies.\n  The current contribution presents a general solution set-based procedure,\nwhich, for a model system of differential equations, respects the geometry of\nthe solution manifold, and yields a set of constraint equations on the unknown\nconstitutive functions, which are necessary and sufficient conditions for the\nentropy production to stay nonnegative for any solution. Similarly to the\nM\\\"uller-Liu procedure, the solution set approach is algorithmic, its output\nbeing a set of constraint equations and a residual entropy inequality. The\nsolution set method is applicable to virtually any physical model, allows for\narbitrary initially postulated forms of the constitutive dependencies, and does\nnot use artificial constructs like Lagrange multipliers. A Maple implementation\nmakes the solution set method computationally straightforward and useful for\nthe constitutive modeling of complex systems.\n  Several computational examples are considered, in particular, models of gas,\nanisotropic fluid, and granular flow dynamics. The resulting constitutive\nfunction forms are analyzed, and comparisons are provided. It is shown how the\nsolution set entropy principle can yield classification problems, leading to\nseveral complementary sets of admissible constitutive functions; such problems\nhave not previously appeared in the constitutive modeling literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2018 17:39:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-05"}

However, this approach is undermined\nif the AGN varies in flux between the epochs of the observations. To address\nthis we measure the characteristic X-ray variability of serendipitously\ndetected AGN in 70 pairs of Chandra observations, separated by intervals of\nbetween one month and thirteen years. After quality cuts, the full sample\nconsists of 1511 sources, although the main analysis uses a subset of 416\nsources selected on the geometric mean of their flux in the pairs of\nobservations, which eliminates selection biases. We find a fractional\nvariability that increases with increasing interval between observations, from\nabout 0.25 for observations separated by tens of days up to about 0.45 for\nobservations separated by $\\sim 10$ years. As a rule of thumb, given the\nprecise X-ray flux of a typical AGN at one epoch, its flux at a second epoch\nsome years earlier or later can be predicted with a precision of about $60\\%$\ndue to its variability (ignoring any statistical noise).

All of these methods\nuse both the simulation model of the aircraft under development and efficient\nalgorithms to find out the critical points of the flight envelope. At the\npreliminary structural design phases detailed models are not available and\nairframe's loads are estimated by empirical relationships or engineering\njudgments. These approximations can induce load uncertainties and may lead to\nexpensive redesign activities through the upcoming detailed sizing process. In\nthe context of preliminary design phase for a weight aircraft variant without\ngeometric change, to overcome this likely drawback, we propose a method based\non the huge and reliable database of an initial aircraft from which the weight\nvariant belongs. More precisely, from the load cases of this initial database,\nresponse surfaces are identified as functions of preliminary parameters (flight\nconditions and structural parameters). Then, these response surfaces are used\nto predict quickly the weight aircraft variant quantities of interest for\npreliminary structural design studies.

In this paper, we present \\emph{ATTention Multi-Agent\nDeep Deterministic Policy Gradient} (ATT-MADDPG) to address this challenge.\nATT-MADDPG extends DDPG, a single-agent actor-critic RL method, with two\nspecial designs. First, in order to model the teammates' policies, the agent\nshould get access to the observations and actions of teammates. ATT-MADDPG\nadopts a centralized critic to collect such information. Second, to model the\nteammates' policies using the collected information in an effective way,\nATT-MADDPG enhances the centralized critic with an attention mechanism. This\nattention mechanism introduces a special structure to explicitly model the\ndynamic joint policy of teammates, making sure that the collected information\ncan be processed efficiently.

Uncertainty behaviour during\nroad-crossing is here defined as a walking stop or a slowing down during a\nroad-crossing behaviour at the red light. Uncertainty happens when there is a\nconflict between different information a pedestrians get, specifically between\nprivate and social information. This uncertainty behaviour is followed either\nby a speeding up to finish to cross the road or a giving-up. Our study showed\nan uncertainty time longer in Japan compared to France. Japanese pedestrians\nhesitated on a longer time when someone accompanied them. Being on the phone\ndid not have an effect on the uncertainty time. There are many more give-ups\nthan speed-ups, and this rate increases with the number of lanes. Moreover,\nthere is a tendency to speed up with the number of pedestrians already crossing\nthe road. This study confirms that pedestrians followed social information at\nroad-crossings and hesitate when they realised their errors, increasing their\nrisk of accidents.

The\nlimited bandwidth of the VCSEL and the adverse chromatic dispersion of the\nfiber are suppressed with pre-equalization based on accurate end-to-end channel\ncharacterizations. With a digital post-equalization, BER performance below the\n7% OH-HDFEC limit is achieved over all cores.

The Down Scatter\nRatio (DSR-quaternary nuclear reactions) method, i.e. the ratio of the 10-12MeV\nneutrons divided by the total number of 14.1MeV neutrons produced, confirms the\nhigh densities reported above.

This paper\npresents a new type of photonic accelerator based on coherent detection that is\nscalable to large ($N \\gtrsim 10^6$) networks and can be operated at high (GHz)\nspeeds and very low (sub-aJ) energies per multiply-and-accumulate (MAC), using\nthe massive spatial multiplexing enabled by standard free-space optical\ncomponents. In contrast to previous approaches, both weights and inputs are\noptically encoded so that the network can be reprogrammed and trained on the\nfly. Simulations of the network using models for digit- and\nimage-classification reveal a \"standard quantum limit\" for optical neural\nnetworks, set by photodetector shot noise. This bound, which can be as low as\n50 zJ/MAC, suggests performance below the thermodynamic (Landauer) limit for\ndigital irreversible computation is theoretically possible in this device. The\nproposed accelerator can implement both fully-connected and convolutional\nnetworks. We also present a scheme for back-propagation and training that can\nbe performed in the same hardware.
