We propose a new algorithm,\nwell suited for parallel and distributed implementations and we provide the\nfirst evaluation of the impact on MPH computations of a preprocessing approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2018 16:39:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-19"}

Extensive evaluations demonstrate the advantages of our\nFPD method over a broad range of state-of-the-art pose estimation approaches in\nterms of model cost-effectiveness on two standard benchmark datasets, MPII\nHuman Pose and Leeds Sports Pose.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2018 17:18:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Apr 2019 14:05:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-03"}

We report on the determination of the\ngluon condensate from lattice QCD measurements of the basic plaquette. This is\na long standing problem, which was eventually solved a few years ago in pure\ngauge. In this context NSPT is crucial: it is actually the only tool enabling\nthe subtraction of the power divergent contribution associated to the identity\noperator in the OPE for the plaquette. This subtraction is actually a delicate\nissue, since the perturbative expansion of the plaquette is on general ground\nexpected to be an asymptotic one, due to renormalons. This in turn results in\nambiguities and the separation of scales in the OPE does not correspond to a\nseparation of perturbative and non-perturbative contributions. All in all, one\nneeds to absorb the ambiguities attached to the perturbative series into the\ndefinition of the condensate itself, i.e. one needs a prescription. A possible\none amounts to summing the perturbative series up to its minimal term, which\nmeans computing up to orders which only NSPT can aim at.

Unsupervised domain adaptation\nsets out to address this problem, aiming to learn a good predictive model for\nthe target domain using labeled examples from the source domain but only\nunlabeled examples from the target domain. Domain alignment approaches this\nproblem by matching the source and target feature distributions, and has been\nused as a key component in many state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods.\nHowever, matching the marginal feature distributions does not guarantee that\nthe corresponding class conditional distributions will be aligned across the\ntwo domains.

Slab-by-slab dynamic B0 shimming using a multi-coil\nintegrated {\\Delta}B0/Rx shim-array, and high in-plane acceleration\n(Rinplane=4) achieved with virtual-coil GRAPPA were also incorporated into a 1\nmm isotropic resolution gSlider acquisition/reconstruction framework to achieve\nan 8-11 fold reduction in geometric distortion compared to single-shot EPI.\nResults: The slab-boundary artifacts were alleviated by the proposed B1+ and T1\ncorrections compared to the standard gSlider reconstruction pipeline for\nshort-TR acquisitions.

Our study demonstrates an instance that classical systems with\ncontrollable geometry can serve as powerful simulators for the discovery of\nnovel topological states of matter and their phase transitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2018 20:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 6 Apr 2019 21:51:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 12 Apr 2019 22:17:36 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2019 01:56:17 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 17 Dec 2019 22:22:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-24"}

The\nprogenitor asymmetry at the pre-supernova stage has recently caught the\nattention as a new ingredient to facilitate shock revival in the delayed\nneutrino-heating mechanism. In this paper, we investigate the importance of the\nprogenitor asymmetries to shock revival with a semi-analytical approach. Free\nparameters were chosen such that the time evolution of shock radii and mass\naccretion rates are compatible with the results of detailed numerical\nsimulations of CCSNe in spherical symmetry. We first estimate the amplitude of\nasymmetries required for the shock revival by the impulsive change of pre-shock\nflows in the context of neutrino heating mechanism, and then convert the\namplitude to the corresponding amplitude in the pre-supernova phase by taking\ninto account the growth of asymmetries during infall. We apply our model to\nvarious types of progenitors and find that the requisite amplitude of\npre-supernova asymmetry is roughly three times larger than the prediction by\ncurrent stellar evolution models unless other additional physical ingredients\nsuch as multi-dimensional fluid instabilities and turbulent convections in\npost-shock flows aid shock revival. We thus conclude that progenitor\nasymmetries can not trigger the shock revival by the impulsive way but rather\nplay a supplementary role in reality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2018 20:00:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-28"}

An analysis\nof intraday volumes for the S&P500 constituent stocks illustrates that (i)\nvolume surprises, i.e., deviations from their respective forecasts, are\ncorrelated across stocks, and (ii) this correlation increases during the last\nfew hours of the trading session. These observations could be attributed, in\npart, to the prevalence of portfolio trading activity that is implicit in the\ngrowth of ETF, passive and systematic investment strategies; and, to the\nincreased trading intensity of such strategies towards the end of the trading\nsession, e.g., due to execution of mutual fund inflows/outflows that are\nbenchmarked to the closing price on each day. In this paper, we investigate the\nconsequences of such portfolio liquidity on price impact and portfolio\nexecution. We derive a linear cross-asset market impact from a stylized model\nthat explicitly captures the fact that a certain fraction of natural liquidity\nproviders only trade portfolios of stocks whenever they choose to execute. We\nfind that due to cross-impact and its intraday variation, it is optimal for a\nrisk-neutral, cost minimizing liquidator to execute a portfolio of orders in a\ncoupled manner, as opposed to a separable VWAP-like execution that is often\nassumed. The optimal schedule couples the execution of the various orders so as\nto be able to take advantage of increased portfolio liquidity towards the end\nof the day. A worst case analysis shows that the potential cost reduction from\nthis optimized execution schedule over the separable approach can be as high as\n6% for plausible model parameters. Finally, we discuss how to estimate\ncross-sectional price impact if one had a dataset of realized portfolio\ntransaction records that exploits the low-rank structure of its coefficient\nmatrix suggested by our analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2018 20:43:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-15"}

The LoTSS DR1 provides deep data (median rms noise\nof 71 $\\mathrm{\\mu}$Jy at 150 MHz) over 424 square degrees of sky, which is\nsufficient to detect 10615 (32 per cent) of the SDSS galaxies over this sky\narea. An improved method to separate active galactic nuclei (AGN) accurately\nfrom sources with radio emission powered by star formation (SF) is developed\nand applied, leading to a sample of 2121 local ($z < 0.3$) radio AGN. The local\n150 MHz luminosity function is derived for radio AGN and SF galaxies\nseparately, and the good agreement with previous studies at 1.4 GHz suggests\nthat the separation method presented is robust. The prevalence of radio AGN\nactivity is confirmed to show a strong dependence on both stellar and black\nhole masses, remarkably reaching a fraction of 100 per cent of the most massive\ngalaxies ($> 10^{11} \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$) displaying radio-AGN activity with\n$L_{\\rm 150 MHz} \\geq 10^{21}$W Hz$^{-1}$; thus, the most massive galaxies are\nalways switched on at some level.

The proposed controllers offer improved performance under abrupt\nworkload changes, shown via rigorous comparison with current state-of-the-art.\nOn our experimental setup, the Single-Input-Single-Output (SISO) controllers\ncan operate on the same server where the resource allocation is performed;\nwhile Multi-Input-Multi-Output (MIMO) controllers are on a separate server\nwhere all the data are collected for decision making. SISO controllers take\ndecisions not dependent to other system states (servers), albeit MIMO\ncontrollers are characterized by increased communication overhead and potential\ndelays. While SISO controllers offer improved performance over MIMO ones, the\nlatter enable a more informed decision making framework for resource allocation\nproblem of multi-tier applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2018 21:30:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-15"}

Recent research supports that eruption of a miniature\nfilament (minifilament) drives many such single-spire jets, and concurrently\ngenerates a miniflare at the eruption site. A different type of coronal jet,\nidentified in X-ray images during the Yohkoh era, are two-sided-loop jets,\nwhich extend from a central excitation location in opposite directions, along\nlow-lying coronal loops more-or-less horizontal to the surface. We observe such\na two-sided-loop jet from the edge of active region (AR) 12473, using data from\nHinode XRT and EIS, and SDO AIA and HMI. Similar to single-spire jets, this\ntwo-sided-loop jet results from eruption of a minifilament, which accelerates\nto over 140 km/s before abruptly stopping after striking overlying\nnearly-horizontal loop field at about 30,000 km altitude and producing the\ntwo-sided-loop jet. Analysis of EIS raster scans show that a hot brightening,\nconsistent with a small flare, develops in the aftermath of the eruption, and\nthat Doppler motions (approx 40 km/s) occur near the jet-formation region. As\nwith many single-spire jets, the magnetic trigger here is apparently flux\ncancelation, which occurs at a rate of approx 4x10^18 Mx/hr, comparable to the\nrate observed in some single-spire AR jets. An apparent increase in the\n(line-of-sight) flux occurs within minutes of onset of the minifilament\neruption, consistent with the apparent increase being due to a rapid\nreconfiguration of low-lying field during and soon after minifilament-eruption\nonset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2018 22:56:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-13"}

Adjusting this\nassumption to reflect more realistic capabilities is an attractive prospect,\nbut one that can only be justified with a rigorous, quantitative framework that\nrelates adversarial restrictions to the protocols security and performance. We\ninvestigate the effect of limitations on the eavesdropper's (Eve's) ability to\nmake a coherent attack on the security of continuous-variable quantum key\ndistribution (CV-QKD). We consider a realistic attack, in which the total\ndecoherence induced during the attack is modelled by a Gaussian channel. Based\non our decoherence model we propose an optimal hybrid attack, which allows Eve\nto perform a combination of both coherent and individual attacks\nsimultaneously. We evaluate the asymptotic and composable finite-size security\nof a heterodyne CV-QKD protocol against such hybrid attacks in terms of Eve's\ndecoherence. We show that when the decoherence is greater than a threshold\nvalue, Eve's most effective strategy is reduced to the individual attack. Thus,\nif we are willing to assume that the decoherence caused by the memory and the\ncollective measurement is large enough, it is sufficient to analyse the\nsecurity of the protocol only against individual attacks, which significantly\nimproves the CV-QKD performance in terms of both the key rate and the maximum\nsecure transmission distance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2018 23:05:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-27"}

Unlike the typical aim, in this paper,\nwe use quantum properties for adding a new functionality to quantum sensors.\nMore concretely, we propose a delegated quantum sensor (a client-server model)\nwith security inbuilt. Suppose that a client wants to measure some target\nfields with high precision, but he/she does not have any high-precision sensor.\nThis leads the client to delegate the sensing to a remote server who possesses\na high-precision sensor. The client gives the server instructions about how to\ncontrol the sensor. The server lets the sensor interact with the target fields\nin accordance with the instructions, and then sends the sensing measurement\nresults to the client. In this case, since the server knows the control process\nand readout results of the sensor, the information of the target fields is\navailable not only for the client but also for the server. We show that, by\nusing an entanglement between the client and the server, an asymmetric\ninformation gain is possible so that only the client can obtain the sufficient\ninformation of the target fields.

For each $i$ $\\left( 1\\leq i\\leq r\\right) $, we choose a minimal\nleft coideal $W_{i}$ of $D_{i}$, and we can define the $R$-adjoint-stable\nalgebra $N_{W_{i}}$ of $W_{i}$. Using Ostrik's theorem on characterizing module\ncategories over monoidal categories, we prove that $V\\in{}_{H}^{H}\\mathcal{YD}$\nis irreducible if and only if there exists an $i$ $\\left( 1\\leq i\\leq r\\right)\n$ and an irreducible right $N_{W_{i}}$-module $U_{i}$, such that $V\\cong\nU_{i}\\otimes_{N_{W_{i}}}\\left( H\\otimes W_{i}\\right) $.\n  Our structure theorem generalizes the results of Dijkgraaf-Pasquier-Roche and\nGould on Yetter-Drinfeld modules over finite group algebras. If $k$ is an\nalgebraically closed field of characteristic, we stress that the\n$R$-adjoint-stable algebra $N_{W_{i}}$ is an algebra over which the dimension\nof each irreducible right module divides its dimension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2018 01:42:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 2019 03:38:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-18"}

In this\nstudy, we investigate the seldom studied two dimensional hexagonal form of\nboron arsenide (h-BAs) using a first-principles approach and by solving the\nBoltzmann Transport Equation for phonons.

Further investigation\nreveals that this is due to the phonon frequency gap caused by large mass\nimbalances, which results in a restricted Umklapp phonon-phonon scattering\nchannel and consequently a higher thermal conductivity. We determine the\nintrinsic lattice thermal conductivity of monolayer h-BAs to be 362.62 W/m-K at\nroom temperature, which is considerably higher compared to the other monolayer\nboron-V compounds of h-BN (231.96 W/m-K), h-BP (187.11 W/m-K), and h-BSb (87.15\nW/m-K).

The concept of\ninfrared Abelian dominance plays an important role in the realization of this\nconcept and through numerical simulations on the lattice, evidence was found\nfor example in the form of the dynamical mass generation for certain gluon\ndegrees of freedom. A promising analytical attempt to explain the generation of\nsuch masses is through condensates of mass dimension two.

Current frameworks for training a\nGenerative Adversarial Network (GAN), learn to disentangle the representations\nof the data in an unsupervised fashion and capture the most significant factors\nof the data variations. However, these approaches ignore the principle of\ncontent and style disentanglement in image generation, which means their\nlearned latent code may alter the content and style of the generated images at\nthe same time. This paper describes the Style and Content Disentangled GAN\n(SC-GAN), a new unsupervised algorithm for training GANs that learns\ndisentangled style and content representations of the data. We assume that the\nrepresentation of an image can be decomposed into a content code that\nrepresents the geometrical information of the data, and a style code that\ncaptures textural properties. Consequently, by fixing the style portion of the\nlatent representation, we can generate diverse images in a particular style.\nReversely, we can set the content code and generate a specific scene in a\nvariety of styles. The proposed SC-GAN has two components: a content code which\nis the input to the generator, and a style code which modifies the scene style\nthrough modification of the Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) layers'\nparameters. We evaluate the proposed SC-GAN framework on a set of baseline\ndatasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2018 03:25:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-15"}

ESPIRiT is one such technique that\nestimates coil sensitivity maps from the auto-calibration region using an\neigenvalue-based method. This method requires choosing several parameters for\nthe the map estimation. Even though ESPIRiT is fairly robust to these parameter\nchoices, occasionally, poor selection can result in reduced performance. The\npurpose of this work is to automatically select parameters in ESPIRiT for more\nrobust and consistent performance across a variety of exams.\n  Theory and Methods: Stein's unbiased risk estimate (SURE) is a method of\ncalculating an unbiased estimate of the mean squared error of an estimator\nunder certain assumptions. We show that this can be used to estimate the\nperformance of ESPIRiT. We derive and demonstrate the use of SURE to optimize\nESPIRiT parameter selection.\n  Results: Simulations show SURE to be an accurate estimator of the mean\nsquared error.

In this paper, we explore open-domain story generation that writes\nstories given a title (topic) as input. We propose a plan-and-write\nhierarchical generation framework that first plans a storyline, and then\ngenerates a story based on the storyline. We compare two planning strategies.\nThe dynamic schema interweaves story planning and its surface realization in\ntext, while the static schema plans out the entire storyline before generating\nstories. Experiments show that with explicit storyline planning, the generated\nstories are more diverse, coherent, and on topic than those generated without\ncreating a full plan, according to both automatic and human evaluations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2018 09:37:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2018 02:48:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 19 Feb 2019 06:43:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

In the latter case, CSTIRAP improves the peak transfer efficiency and\nrobustness, boosting the transfer efficiency substantially compared to repeated\nSTIRAP. We also propose and demonstrate a universal version of CSTIRAP, which\nshows improved performance compared to the originally proposed composite\nversion.

Recently, Hou (2018) created word embeddings\n(embeddings_PP) to capture associative similarity (ie, relatedness) between\nnouns by exploring the syntactic structure of noun phrases. But embeddings_PP\nonly contains word representations for nouns. In this paper, we create new word\nvectors by combining embeddings_PP with GloVe. This new word embeddings\n(embeddings_bridging) are a more general lexical knowledge resource for\nbridging and allow us to represent the meaning of an NP beyond its head easily.\nWe therefore develop a deterministic approach for bridging anaphora resolution,\nwhich represents the semantics of an NP based on its head noun and\nmodifications. We show that this simple approach achieves the competitive\nresults compared to the best system in Hou et al.(2013b) which explores Markov\nLogic Networks to model the problem.

This creates the feedback\nthat limits the X-ray luminosity of the compact secondary. Wind inhibition\nmight be weakened by the effect of small-scale wind inhomogeneities (clumping)\npossibly affecting the limiting X-ray luminosity. We study the influence of\nX-ray irradiation on the stellar wind for different radial distributions of\nclumping. We calculate hot star wind models with external irradiation and\nclumping using our global wind code. The models are calculated for different\nparameters of the binary. We determine the parameters for which the X-ray wind\nionization leads to a decrease of the radiative force. This causes a decrease\nof the wind velocity and even of the mass-loss rate in the case of extreme\nX-ray irradiation. Clumping weakens the effect of X-ray irradiation because it\nfavours recombination and leads to an increase of the wind mass-loss rate. The\nbest match between the models and observed properties of high-mass X-ray\nbinaries (HMXB) is derived with radially variable clumping. We describe the\ninfluence of X-ray irradiation on the terminal velocity and on the mass-loss\nrate in a parametric way. The X-ray luminosities predicted within the Bondi\ntheory agree nicely with observations when accounting for X-ray irradiation.\nThe ionizing feedback regulates the accretion onto the compact companion\nresulting in a relatively stable X-ray source. The wind-powered accretion model\ncan account for large luminosities in HMXBs only when introducing the ionizing\nfeedback. There are two possible states following from the dependence of X-ray\nluminosity on the wind terminal velocity and mass-loss rate. One state has low\nX-ray luminosity and a nearly undisturbed wind, and the second state has high\nX-ray luminosity and exhibits a strong influence of X-rays on the flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2018 11:09:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-12"}

Current research mainly uses\nseveral statistical indicators of complex networks to analyze the road network\nsystems. However, these methods are essentially node-based. These node-based\nmethods are more concerned with the number of connections between nodes, and\nlack of consideration for interactions. So, this leads to the well-known node\nparadox problem, and their ability of characterizing the local and intrinsic\nproperties of a network is weak. From the perspective of network intrinsic\ngeometry, this paper proposes a method for measuring road network vulnerability\nusing a discrete Ricci curvature, which can identify the key sections of a road\nnetwork and indicate its fragile elements. The results show that our method\nperforms better than complex network statistics on measuring the vulnerability\nof a road network. Additionally, it can characterize the evolution of the road\nnetwork vulnerability among different periods of time in the same city through\nour method. Finally, we compare our method with the previous method of\ncentrality and show the different between them.

Using those\ntechniques, we are able to reduce the size of Marlin dictionaries by a factor\nof 16, not only enabling faster encoding speed, but also achieving better\ncompression efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2018 13:05:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-15"}

It is a simpler variant of the gravitational three-body problem and\nalso arises as the classical limit of a model of coupled Josephson junctions.\nUnlike in the gravitational problem, there are no singularities (neither\ncollisional nor non-collisional), leading to global existence and uniqueness of\nsolutions. In appropriate units, the non-negative energy $E$ of the relative\nmotion is the only free parameter. We find analogues of the Euler-Lagrange\nfamily of periodic solutions: pendulum and isosceles solutions at all energies\nand choreographies up to moderate energies. The model displays\norder-chaos-order behavior: it is integrable at zero and infinitely high\nenergies but displays a fairly sharp transition from regular to chaotic\nbehavior as $E$ is increased beyond $E_c \\approx 4$ and a more gradual return\nto regularity. The transition to chaos is manifested in a dramatic rise of the\nfraction of the area of the Hill region of Poincar\\'e surfaces occupied by\nchaotic sections and also in the spontaneous breaking of discrete symmetries of\nPoincar\\'e sections present at lower energies. Interestingly, the above\npendulum solutions alternate between being stable and unstable, with the\ntransition energies cascading geometrically from either side at $E = 4$. The\ntransition to chaos is also reflected in the curvature of the Jacobi-Maupertuis\nmetric that ceases to be everywhere positive when $E$ exceeds four.

In this context, our aim is to recover the\ncommunity labels better than by random guess, based only on the observation of\nthe graph.\n  In the sparse case, where edge probabilities are in $O(1/n)$, we introduce a\nnew spectral method based on the distance matrix $D^{(l)}$, where $D^{(l)}_{ij}\n= 1$ iff the graph distance between $i$ and $j$, noted $d(i, j)$ is equal to\n$\\ell$.

In this paper, we demonstrate that\nthe hexagonal ErMnO3 single crystals also unveils a giant rotating\nmagnetocaloric effect that can be obtained by spinning them in constant\nmagnetic fields around their a or b axes. When the ErMnO3 crystal is rotated\nwith the magnetic field initially parallel to the c-axis, the resulting entropy\nchange reaches maximum values of 7, 17 and 20 J/kg K under a constant magnetic\nfield of 2, 5 and 7 T, respectively. These values are comparable or even larger\nthan those shown by some of the best orthorhombic phases. More interestingly,\nthe generated anisotropic thermal effect is about three times larger than that\nexhibited by the hexagonal HoMnO3 single crystal. The enhancement of the\nrotating magnetocaloric effect in the hexagonal ErMnO3 compound arises from the\nunique features of Er3+ magnetic sublattice. In fact, the Er3+ magnetic moments\nlocated at 2a sites experience a first-order metamagnetic transition close to 3\nK along the c-axis resulting in a peaked magnetocaloric effect over a narrower\ntemperature range. In contrast, the (paramagnetic) behaviour of Er3+ magnetic\nmoments within the ab-plane, produces a larger magnetocaloric effect over a\nwider temperature range. Therefore, the magnetocaloric effect anisotropy is\nmaximized between the c and the ab-directions, leading to a giant rotating\nmagnetocaloric effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2018 15:22:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-05"}

In the last few years, therefore,\ntree-based phylogenetic networks, which are defined by a spanning tree called a\nsubdivision tree, have attracted attention of theoretical biologists. However,\nthe application of such networks is still not easy, due to many problems whose\ntime complexities are not clearly understood. In this paper, we provide a\ngeneral framework for solving those various old or new problems from a coherent\nperspective, rather than analyzing the complexity of each individual problem or\ndeveloping an algorithm one by one. More precisely, we establish a structure\ntheorem that gives a way to canonically decompose any rooted binary\nphylogenetic network N into maximal zig-zag trails that are uniquely\ndetermined, and use it to characterize the set of subdivision trees of N in the\nform of a direct product, in a way reminiscent of the structure theorem for\nfinitely generated Abelian groups. From the main results, we derive a series of\nlinear time and linear time delay algorithms for the following problems: given\na rooted binary phylogenetic network N, 1) determine whether or not N has a\nsubdivision tree and find one if there exists any; 2) measure the deviation of\nN from being tree-based; 3) compute the number of subdivision trees of N; 4)\nlist all subdivision trees of N; and 5) find a subdivision tree to maximize or\nminimize a prescribed objective function.

However, scaling up the atom number as well as the\nsystem size amounts to entering a collective emission regime, where\nfiber-induced superradiant spontaneous emission dominates over free space\ndecay. We numerically study this super- and subradiant decay of highly excited\natomic states for one or several transverse fiber modes as present in hollow\ncore fibers.

Two\nindependent but complementary approaches are followed to achieve exact results.\nFirst, to keep the structure of the Boltzmann collision operator, the so-called\ninelastic Maxwell models (IMM) are considered. In this model, since the\ncollision rate is independent of the relative velocity of the two colliding\nparticles, the forms of the collisional moments can be obtained without the\nknowledge of the velocity distribution function.

Micrometer- and sub-micrometer-sized dust particles are subject to\nsolar gravity and radiation pressure as well as to interactions with the\ninterplanetary magnetic field that result in a complex size-dependent flow\npattern of ISD in the planetary system.

Extensive\nexperiments on carefully-designed environments based on two real-world datasets\ndemonstrate that our model provides superior recommendation performance and\nsignificant efficiency improvement over state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2018 15:53:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-15"}

We develop a mathematical model to describe these\nphenomena by exploiting the asymptotic limit in which the bending stiffness is\nsmall compared to stresses in the sheet. The results of this analysis show\nthat, at a time $t$ after impact, the transverse wave is located at a radial\ndistance $r\\sim t^{1/2}$ from the impactor, in contrast to the classic $r\\sim\nt^{2/3}$ scaling observed for capillary--inertia ripples produced by dropping a\nstone into a pond. We describe the shape of this wave, starting from the\nsimplest case of a point impactor, but subsequently addressing a finite-radius\nspherical impactor, contrasting this case with the classic Wagner theory of\nimpact.

As the existing change point detectors\nrequire the post-damage feature distribution, which is unavailable in SHM, we\npropose a maximum likelihood method to learn the distribution parameters from\nthe time-series data. The proposed damage detection using estimated parameters\nalso achieves the optimal performance. Also, we utilize the detection results\nto find damage location without any further computation.

It is\nsuspected that non-ideal aspects of the phase-gratings was a leading\ncontributor to this deficiency and that phase-gratings needed to be\nquantitatively assessed and optimized. Here we characterize neutron diffraction\nfrom phase-gratings using Bragg diffraction crystals to determine the optimal\nphase-grating orientations. We show well-defined diffraction peaks and explore\nperturbations to the diffraction peaks and the effects on interferometer\ncontrast as a function of grating alignment. This technique promises to improve\nthe contrast of the grating interferometers by providing in-situ aides to\ngrating alignment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2018 23:59:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-13"}
