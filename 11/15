They are an important tool\nin quantum optics and have been widely applied in the context of time-frequency\nanalysis and pseudo-differential operators. Phase-space distribution functions\nare usually specified via integral transformations or convolutions which can be\naverted and subsumed by (displaced) parity operators proposed in this work.\nBuilding on earlier work for Wigner distribution functions [A. Grossmann, Comm.\nMath. Phys. 48(3), 191 (1976)], parity operators give rise to a general class\nof distribution functions in the form of quantum-mechanical expectation values.\nThis enables us to precisely characterize the mathematical existence of general\nphase-space distribution functions. We then relate these distribution functions\nto the so-called Cohen class [L. Cohen, J. Math. Phys. 7(5), 781 (1966)] and\nrecover various quantization schemes and distribution functions from the\nliterature. The parity-operator approach is also applied to the Born-Jordan\ndistribution which originates from the Born-Jordan quantization [M. Born, P.\nJordan, Z. Phys. 34(1), 858 (1925)]. The corresponding parity operator is\nwritten as a weighted average of both displacements and squeezing operators and\nwe determine its generalized spectral decomposition. This leads to an efficient\ncomputation of the Born-Jordan parity operator in the number-state basis and\nexample quantum states reveal unique features of the Born-Jordan distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2018 16:06:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 29 Jun 2019 09:49:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2022 21:13:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-29"}

When the techniques of random modulation are used in communication\nsystem receivers, one can design a spectrally shaped sequence that mitigates\ninterferer bands while preserving message bands. Common implementation\nconstraints require sequence quantization, which turns the design problem\nformulation to an integer optimization problem solved using a semidefinite\nprogram on a matrix that is restricted to have rank one. Common approximation\nschemes for this problem are not amenable due to the distortion to the spectrum\ncaused by the required quantization. We propose a method that leverages a\nrandomized projection and quantization of the solution of a semidefinite\nprogram, an approach that has been previously used for related integer\nprograms. We provide a theoretical and numerical analysis on the feasibility\nand quality of the approximation provided by the proposed approach.\nFurthermore, numerical simulations show that our proposed approach returns the\nsame sequence as an exhaustive search (when feasible), showcasing its accuracy\nand efficiency.

AVs are a complex system composed of many subsystems,\nmaking them a typical target for attackers. Therefore, the firmware of the\ndifferent subsystems needs to be updated to the latest version by the\nmanufacturer to fix bugs and introduce new features, e.g., using security\npatches. In this paper, we propose a distributed firmware update scheme for the\nAVs' subsystems, leveraging blockchain and smart contract technology. A\nconsortium blockchain made of different AVs manufacturers is used to ensure the\nauthenticity and integrity of firmware updates. Instead of depending on\ncentralized third parties to distribute the new updates, we enable AVs, namely\ndistributors, to participate in the distribution process and we take advantage\nof their mobility to guarantee high availability and fast delivery of the\nupdates. To incentivize AVs to distribute the updates, a reward system is\nestablished that maintains a credit reputation for each distributor account in\nthe blockchain. A zero-knowledge proof protocol is used to exchange the update\nin return for a proof of distribution in a trust-less environment. Moreover, we\nuse attribute-based encryption (ABE) scheme to ensure that only authorized AVs\nwill be able to download and use a new update. Our analysis indicates that the\nadditional cryptography primitives and exchanged transactions do not affect the\noperation of the AVs network. Also, our security analysis demonstrates that our\nscheme is efficient and secure against different attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2018 16:58:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-15"}

Attempting a Koopman decomposition is simple in\npractice due to a connection with Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD). However,\nthere are non-trivial requirements for the Koopman decomposition and DMD to\noverlap which mean it is often difficult to establish whether the latter is\ntruly approximating the former. Here, we focus on nonlinear systems containing\nmultiple simple invariant solutions where it is unclear how to construct a\nconsistent Koopman decomposition, or how DMD might be applied to locate these\nsolutions. First, we derive a Koopman decomposition for a heteroclinic\nconnection in a Stuart-Landau equation revealing two possible expansions. The\nexpansions are centred about the two fixed points of the equation and extend\nbeyond their linear subspaces before breaking down at a crossover point in\nstate space. Well-designed DMD can extract the two expansions provided that the\ntime window does not contain this crossover point. We then apply DMD to the\nNavier-Stokes equations near to a heteroclinic connection in low-Reynolds\nnumber ($Re=O(100)$) plane Couette flow where there are multiple simple\ninvariant solutions beyond the constant shear basic state. This reveals as many\ndifferent Koopman decompositions as simple invariant solutions present and\nagain indicates the existence of crossover points between the expansions in\nstate space. Again, DMD can extract these expansions only if it does not\ninclude a crossover point.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2018 16:59:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-25"}

However, the\nwell-posedness issue in both problems is an even more fundamental one: in some\ncases, both Robust PCA and matrix completion can fail to have any solutions at\ndue to the set of low-rank plus sparse matrices not being closed, which in turn\nis equivalent to the notion of the matrix rigidity function not being lower\nsemicontinuous (Kumar et al., 2014). By constructing infinite families of\nmatrices, we derive bounds on the rank and sparsity such that the set of\nlow-rank plus sparse matrices is not closed.

In this paper, we show\nthat in a broad class of network settings where we allow for weak signals,\nsevere degree heterogeneity, and a wide range of network sparsity, SCORE\nachieves prefect clustering and has the so-called \"exponential rate\" in Hamming\nclustering errors.

Due to the curse\nof dimensionality and sparsity in graphical datasets, this approach has become\nindispensable for machine learning tasks over large networks. The majority of\nexisting literature has considered this technique under the assumption that the\nnetwork is static. However, networks in many applications, nodes and edges\naccrue to a growing network as a streaming. A small number of very recent\nresults have addressed the problem of embedding for dynamic networks. However,\nthey either rely on knowledge of vertex attributes, suffer high-time complexity\nor need to be re-trained without closed-form expression. Thus the approach of\nadapting the existing methods to the streaming environment faces non-trivial\ntechnical challenges.\n  These challenges motivate developing new approaches to the problems of\nstreaming network embedding. In this paper, We propose a new framework that is\nable to generate latent features for new vertices with high efficiency and low\ncomplexity under specified iteration rounds. We formulate a constrained\noptimization problem for the modification of the representation resulting from\na stream arrival. We show this problem has no closed-form solution and instead\ndevelop an online approximation solution. Our solution follows three steps: (1)\nidentify vertices affected by new vertices, (2) generate latent features for\nnew vertices, and (3) update the latent features of the most affected vertices.\nThe generated representations are provably feasible and not far from the\noptimal ones in terms of expectation. Multi-class classification and clustering\non five real-world networks demonstrate that our model can efficiently update\nvertex representations and simultaneously achieve comparable or even better\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2018 18:02:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-15"}

Utilizing the path integral, we\nderive a generalized consistency relation that relates a squeezed $(N+1)$-point\ncorrelation function to an $N$-point function, where the relevant soft mode is\nat early rather than late time. This generalized (early-late-time) version has\nwider applicability than the standard consistency relation where all modes are\nevaluated at late times. We elucidate the conditions under which the latter\nfollows from the former. A key ingredient is the physical mode condition: that\nthe nonlinear part of the symmetry transformation must match the time\ndependence of the dominant, long wavelength physical mode. This is closely\nrelated to, but distinct from, the adiabatic mode condition. Our derivation\nsheds light on a number of otherwise puzzling features of the standard\nconsistency relation: (1) the underlying nonlinearly-realized symmetries (such\nas dilation and special conformal transformation SCT) originate as residual\ngauge redundancies, yet the consistency relation has physical content---for\ninstance, it can be violated; (2) the standard consistency relation is known to\nfail in ultra-slow-roll inflation, but since dilation and SCT remain good\nsymmetries, there should be a replacement for the standard relation; (3) in\nlarge scale structure applications, it is known that the standard consistency\nrelation breaks down if the long wavelength power spectrum is too blue. The\nearly-late-time consistency relation helps address these puzzles. We introduce\na toy model where explicit checks of this generalized consistency relation are\nsimple to carry out.

Owing to the generality of this model\nclass, inference relies on `black-box' Monte Carlo methods that are often not\nable to take advantage of conditional independence and exchangeability, which\nhave historically been the cornerstones of efficient inference. We here seek to\ndevelop a `middle ground' between probabilistic models with fully dynamic and\nfully static computation graphs. To this end, we introduce a combinator library\nfor the Probabilistic Torch framework. Combinators are functions that accept\nmodels and return transformed models. We assume that models are dynamic, but\nthat model composition is static, in the sense that combinator application\ntakes place prior to evaluating the model on data. Combinators provide\nprimitives for both model and inference composition. Model combinators take the\nform of classic functional programming constructs such as map and reduce.

The method\nhas led to molecular detections of H2O, CO, and TiO in hot Jupiters using large\nground-based telescopes.

Transitions are identified by\nthe spin-wave instabilities and by the Luttinger-Tisza approach.

However, for a two-dimensional\nsurface of the full 3D parameter space, the spin-wave spectrum in one of the\nstripe phases exhibits an enigmatic accidental degeneracy manifested by\npseudo-Goldstone modes. As a result, despite the nearly classical ground state,\nthe ordering transition temperature in a wide region of the phase diagram is\nsignificantly suppressed from the mean-field expectation.

In response, the CDC recommends that departments of health perform a\nstandardized incidence ratio (SIR) analysis to determine whether the observed\ncancer incidence is higher than expected. This approach has several limitations\nthat are well documented in the literature. In this paper we propose a novel\ncausal inference approach to cancer cluster investigations, rooted in the\npotential outcomes framework. Assuming that a source of hazard representing a\npotential cause of increased cancer rates in the community is identified a\npriori, we introduce a new estimand called the causal SIR (cSIR). The cSIR is a\nratio defined as the expected cancer incidence in the exposed population\ndivided by the expected cancer incidence under the (counterfactual) scenario of\nno exposure. To estimate the cSIR we need to overcome two main challenges: 1)\nidentify unexposed populations that are as similar as possible to the exposed\none to inform estimation under the counterfactual scenario of no exposure, and\n2) make inference on cancer incidence in these unexposed populations using\npublicly available data that are often available at a much higher level of\nspatial aggregation than what is desired. We overcome the first challenge by\nrelying on matching. We overcome the second challenge by developing a Bayesian\nhierarchical model that borrows information from other sources to impute cancer\nincidence at the desired finer level of spatial aggregation.

The phase curve includes the transit,\nsecondary eclipse, and sinusoidal modulations across the orbital phase shaped\nby the planet's atmospheric characteristics and the star-planet gravitational\ninteraction. We measure the beaming (Doppler boosting) and tidal ellipsoidal\ndistortion phase modulations and show that the amplitudes of both agree with\ntheoretical expectations. We find that the light from the planet's day-side\nhemisphere occulted during secondary eclipse, with a relative brightness of\n$341_{-18}^{+17}$ ppm, is dominated by thermal emission, leading to an upper\nlimit on the geometric albedo in the TESS band of 0.048 (2$\\sigma$).

We find that its maximum is well-aligned with the\nsub-stellar point, to within 2.9 deg (2$\\sigma$). We do not detect light from\nthe planet's night-side hemisphere, with an upper limit of 43 ppm (2$\\sigma$),\nwhich is 13 % of the day-side brightness.

This is due to the existence of a more\nrigorous constraint on the perturbation space for sequential data, and the lack\nof a proper metric for measuring the perturbation.

The main\ncontribution of our work is that we derive the precise asymptotic behavior of\nthe upper order statistics of the LFMO distribution. More specifically, we\nconsider a sequence of $n$ univariate random variables jointly distributed as a\nmultivariate LFMO distribution and analyze the order statistics of the sequence\nas $n$ grows. Our main result states that if the underlying L\\'evy subordinator\nis in the normal domain of attraction of a stable distribution with index of\nstability $\\alpha$ then, after certain logarithmic centering and scaling, the\nupper order statistics converge in distribution to a stable distribution if\n$\\alpha>1$ or a simple transformation of it if $\\alpha\\leq1$. Our result is\nespecially useful in network reliability and systemic risk, when modeling the\nlifetimes of components in a system using the LFMO distribution, as it allows\nto understand the behavior of systems that rely on its last working components.\nOur result can also give easily computable confidence intervals for these\ncomponents, provided that a proper convergence analysis is carried out first.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2018 19:59:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2018 20:26:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 22 May 2019 01:16:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-11"}

Whether training on large quantities of data (i.e. big data) is\nthe right or the wrong approach, is debatable. The fact is, that training\nalgorithms the same way we learn ourselves, comes with limitations. This paper\ndiscusses the issues around applying a human-like approach to train algorithms\nand the implications of this approach when using limited data. Several current\nstudies involving non-data-driven algorithms and natural examples are also\ndiscussed and certain alternative approaches are suggested.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2018 20:44:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-16"}

The molecular cloud G337.342$-$0.119, the\n`Pebble,' is a candidate for such a cold progenitor. Although G337.342$-$0.119\nwas originally identified as four separate ATLASGAL clumps, the similarity in\ntheir molecular line velocities and linewidths in the MALT90 dataset\ndemonstrate that these four clumps are in fact one single, coherent cloud.

It is clear\nthat the metallization takes place electrochemically and there has previously\nbeen extensive evidence for the removal of small amounts of oxygen during ionic\nliquid gating. Hydrogen intercalation has also been proposed, but the source of\nthe hydrogen has remained unclear. In this work, solid-state magic angle\nspinning NMR spectroscopy is used to investigate the thermal metal-insulator\ntransition in VO2, before progressing to catalytically hydrogenated and\nelectrochemically metallized VO2. Electrochemical metallization of bulk VO2\nparticles is shown to be associated with intercalation of hydrogen, the degree\nof which can be measured with quantitative 1H NMR spectroscopy. Possible\nsources of the hydrogen are explored, and by using a selectively deuterated\nionic liquid, it is revealed that the hydrogenation is due to deprotonation of\nthe ionic liquid; specifically, for the commonly used dialkylimidazolium based\nionic liquids, it is the \"carbene\" proton that is responsible. Increasing the\ntemperature of the electrochemistry is shown to increase the degree of\nhydrogenation, forming first a less hydrogenated metallic phase then a more\nhydrogenated insulating Curie-Weiss paramagnetic phase, both of which were also\nobserved for catalytically hydrogenated VO2. The NMR results are supported by\nmagnetic susceptibility measurements, which corroborate the degree of Pauli and\nCurie-Weiss paramagnetism. NMR spectroscopy is used to identify the presence of\nhydrogen in an electrolyte gated thin film of VO2, suggesting that electrolyte\nbreakdown, proton intercalation and reactions with decomposition products\nwithin the electrolyte should not be ignored when interpreting the electronic\nand structural changes observed in electrochemical gating experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2018 21:41:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2018 09:47:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-06"}

Recent measurements of the\nsplashback feature around optically selected galaxy clusters have found that\nthe splashback radius, $r_{\\rm sp}$, is smaller than predicted by N-body\nsimulations. A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that $r_{\\rm sp}$\ninferred from the observed radial distribution of galaxies is affected by\nselection effects related to the optical cluster-finding algorithms. We test\nthis possibility by measuring the splashback feature in clusters selected via\nthe SZ effect in data from the South Pole Telescope SZ survey and the Atacama\nCosmology Telescope Polarimeter survey. The measurement is accomplished by\ncorrelating these clusters with galaxies detected in the Dark Energy Survey\nYear 3 data. The SZ observable used to select clusters in this analysis is\nexpected to have a tighter correlation with halo mass and to be more immune to\nprojection effects and aperture-induced biases than optically selected\nclusters. We find that the measured $r_{\\rm sp}$ for SZ-selected clusters is\nconsistent with the expectations from simulations, although the small number of\nSZ-selected clusters makes a precise comparison difficult. In agreement with\nprevious work, when using optically selected redMaPPer clusters, $r_{\\rm sp}$\nis $\\sim$ $2\\sigma$ smaller than in the simulations. These results motivate\ndetailed investigations of selection biases in optically selected cluster\ncatalogs and exploration of the splashback feature around larger samples of\nSZ-selected clusters. Additionally, we investigate trends in the galaxy profile\nand splashback feature as a function of galaxy color, finding that blue\ngalaxies have profiles close to a power law with no discernible splashback\nfeature, which is consistent with them being on their first infall into the\ncluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2018 21:44:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 May 2019 17:16:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-27"}

What makes this\nproblem challenging is that the decision whether $\\tau=t$ may only depend on\nthe values of the random variables $X_1,\\dots,X_t$ and on the distribution $F$.\nFor quite some time the best known bound for the problem was\n$\\alpha\\geq1-1/e\\approx0.632$ [Hill and Kertz, 1982].

Instead we consider filtering in the wavelet domain with\nlearnable filters. The wavelet space allows us to have local, smooth filters\nwith far fewer parameters, and learnability can give us flexibility. We present\na novel layer which takes CNN activations into the wavelet space, learns\nparameters and returns to the pixel space.

The former is developed\nwith contextual self-attention and multi-scale techniques to encode a sentence\ninto an embedding tensor. This module is shortly called Contextual\nself-Attention Multi-scale Sentence Embedding (CAMSE). The latter employs two\nscoring strategies: Semantic Matching Scoring (SMS) and Semantic Association\nScoring (SAS). SMS measures similarity while SAS captures association between\nsentence pairs: a medical question concatenated with a candidate choice, and a\npiece of corresponding supportive evidence. The proposed framework is examined\nby two Medical Question Answering(MedicalQA) datasets which are collected from\nreal-world applications: medical exam and clinical diagnosis based on\nelectronic medical records (EMR). The comparison results show that our proposed\nframework achieved significant improvements compared to competitive baseline\napproaches.

This suggests the existence of the intergalactic\nmagnetic fields, which may have a primordial origin. One of the mechanisms that\ncan produce primordial magnetic fields is so-called the chiral plasma\ninstability, where the (hyper) magnetic fields are destabilized when a large\nchiral asymmetry exists in the high-temperature plasma in the early Universe.\nWe argue that such a large chiral asymmetry can be produced through the GUT\nbaryogenesis. Note that the chiral asymmetry is a good conserved quantity at\nhigh temperature when the Yukawa interaction is weak enough. We also point out\nthat the generated hypermagnetic fields are maximally helical, and hence baryon\nand lepton asymmetry is inevitably produced through the chiral anomaly in the\nStandard Model through $U(1)_Y$ gauge interaction at the electroweak symmetry\nbreaking. Consequently, the magnetic fields suggested by the blazar\nobservations over-produce baryon asymmetry. Thus the chiral plasma instability\nalone cannot be responsible for the intergalactic magnetic fields but can be\nresponsible for the baryon asymmetry of the Universe. In other words, GUT\nbaryogenesis without $B$-$L$ asymmetry generation is revived as a viable\nbaryogenesis scenario, which otherwise has been thought to suffer from $B$+$L$\nwashout by sphalerons.

To portray a gait, existing gait recognition methods utilize either a\ngait template, where temporal information is hard to preserve, or a gait\nsequence, which must keep unnecessary sequential constraints and thus loses the\nflexibility of gait recognition. In this paper we present a novel perspective,\nwhere a gait is regarded as a set consisting of independent frames. We propose\na new network named GaitSet to learn identity information from the set. Based\non the set perspective, our method is immune to permutation of frames, and can\nnaturally integrate frames from different videos which have been filmed under\ndifferent scenarios, such as diverse viewing angles, different clothes/carrying\nconditions. Experiments show that under normal walking conditions, our\nsingle-model method achieves an average rank-1 accuracy of 95.0% on the CASIA-B\ngait dataset and an 87.1% accuracy on the OU-MVLP gait dataset. These results\nrepresent new state-of-the-art recognition accuracy. On various complex\nscenarios, our model exhibits a significant level of robustness. It achieves\naccuracies of 87.2% and 70.4% on CASIA-B under bag-carrying and coat-wearing\nwalking conditions, respectively. These outperform the existing best methods by\na large margin. The method presented can also achieve a satisfactory accuracy\nwith a small number of frames in a test sample, e.g., 82.5% on CASIA-B with\nonly 7 frames.

In the case of Weyl semimetals, to reproduce the nonsaturating linear\nmagnetoresistance seen in experiments, the use of screened charged impurities\nis inevitable. In this paper, these are included using the first Born\napproximation for the self-energy. The screening wave number is calculated\nusing the random phase approximation with the polarization function taking into\naccount the electron-electron interaction. The Hall conductivity is calculated\nanalytically in the case of no impurities and is shown to be perfectly\ninversely proportional to the magnetic field.

In the past years, the database\ncommunity has been working on different techniques for Approximate Query\nProcessing (AQP) that aim to deliver an approximate query result given a fixed\ntime bound to support interactive visualizations better. However, classical AQP\napproaches suffer from various problems that limit the applicability to support\nthe ad-hoc exploration of a new data set: (1) Classical AQP approaches that\nperform online sampling can support ad-hoc exploration queries but yield low\nquality if executed over rare subpopulations. (2) Classical AQP approaches that\nrely on offline sampling can use some form of biased sampling to mitigate these\nproblems but require a priori knowledge of the workload, which is often not\nrealistic if users want to explore a new database. In this paper, we present a\nnew approach to AQP called Model-based AQP that leverages generative models\nlearned over the complete database to answer SQL queries at interactive speeds.\nDifferent from classical AQP approaches, generative models allow us to compute\nresponses to ad-hoc queries and deliver high-quality estimates also over rare\nsubpopulations at the same time. In our experiments with real and synthetic\ndata sets, we show that Model-based AQP can in many scenarios return more\naccurate results in a shorter runtime.

These methods, however,\nsuffer from high variance in gradient estimation, resulting in poor sample\nefficiency. To mitigate this issue, a number of variance-reduction approaches\nhave been proposed. Unfortunately, in the challenging problems with delayed\nrewards, these approaches either bring a relatively modest improvement or do\nreduce variance at expense of introducing a bias and undermining convergence.\nThe unbiased methods of gradient estimation, in general, only partially reduce\nvariance, without eliminating it completely even in the limit of exact\nknowledge of the value functions and problem dynamics, as one might have\nwished. In this work we propose an unbiased method that does completely\neliminate variance under some, commonly encountered, conditions. Of practical\ninterest is the limit of deterministic dynamics and small policy stochasticity.\nIn the case of a quadratic value function, as in linear quadratic Gaussian\nmodels, the policy randomness need not be small. We use such a model to analyze\nperformance of the proposed variance-elimination approach and compare it with\nstandard variance-reduction methods. The core idea behind the approach is to\nuse control variates at all future times down the trajectory.

While it is\nrecognized that the altered polymer region near filler particles, the\ninterphase, significantly contributes to enhancements of composite properties,\nthe spatial distribution of interphase properties is rarely considered due to\nlack of local property measurements. In recent years, the Atomic Force\nMicroscopy (AFM) technique has begun to make local property measurements of the\ninterphase available.

However, the origin and evolution of these filaments are not yet\nwell understood, partly because of the lack of kinematic information. To\nexamine whether the B211/B213 filament is accreting background gas due to its\ngravitational potential, we produced a toy accretion model and compared its\npredictions to the 12CO(1--0) and 13CO(1--0) velocity patterns. We also\nexamined the spatial distributions of Halpha, 857 GHz continuum, and HI\nemission to search for evidence of large-scale external effects. We estimated\nthe depth of the cloud around the B211/B213 filament to be 0.3--0.7 pc under\nthe assumption that the density of the gas is the same as the 13CO critical\ndensity. Compared to a linear extent of >10 pc in the plane of the sky, this\nsuggests that the 3D morphology of the cloud is sheet-like. 12CO and 13CO PV\ndiagrams perpendicular to the filament axis show that the emission from the gas\nsurrounding B211/B213 is redshifted to the northeast of the filament and\nblueshifted to the southwest, respectively, and that the velocities of both\ncomponents approach the filament velocity as the line of sight approaches the\nfilament crest. The PV diagrams predicted by our accretion model are in good\nagreement with the observed 12CO and 13CO PV diagrams, supporting the scenario\nof mass accretion into the filament proposed by Palmeirim et al. Moreover,\ninspection of the distribution of the Halpha and 857 GHz emission in the\nTaurus-California-Perseus region suggests that the B211/B213 filament may have\nformed as a result of an expanding supershell generated by the Per OB2\nassociation.

By\n$n$-acceleration we essentially mean the higher order time derivatives of the\nposition vector of the trajectory of a point particle, adapted to Minkowski\nspacetime or eventually to curved spacetime. The $2$-acceleration is known as\nthe Jerk, the $3$-acceleration as the Snap, etc. As for the concept of {\\sl\nproper} $n$-acceleration we give a specific definition involving the\ninstantaneous comoving frame of the observer and we discuss, in such framework,\nthe difficulties in finding a characterization of this notion as a Lorentz\ninvariant statement. We show how the Frenet-Serret formalism helps to address\nthe problem. In particular we find that our definition of an observer with\nconstant proper acceleration corresponds to the vanishing of the third\ncurvature invariant $\\kappa_3$ (thus the motion is three dimensional in\nMinkowski spacetime) together with the constancy of the first and second\ncurvature invariants and the restriction $\\kappa_2 < \\kappa_1$, the particular\ncase $\\kappa_2=0$ being the one commonly referred to in the literature.

Instead of de\nnovo synthesis of data, here we assume logged, real experience and model\nalternative outcomes of this experience under counterfactual actions, actions\nthat were not actually taken. Based on this, we propose the\nCounterfactually-Guided Policy Search (CF-GPS) algorithm for learning policies\nin POMDPs from off-policy experience.

As shortest route comprised of hub nodes and chances of congestion is\nmore on these nodes. Hence, BC-BC correlation is used to find user's route. A\nconnection between two hub nodes reduces the data forwarding capacity of\nconnecting link with higher probability. If a node shows disassortativity with\nits neighbors then it may forward more packets and may be chosen for routing.\nFurthermore, user's optimal data sending rate as well as critical packet\ngeneration rate of the proposed model is calculated and shown improved results\nin comparison than the classical scale-free network model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Nov 2018 10:13:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-18"}

The harmonic bath is comprised of identical\noscillators, and may be second quantised for use with CCSB, so that this\nproblem may be thought of as a bosonic bath with an impurity. The\ncross-correlation function for the dynamics of the system and Fourier transform\nspectrum compare extremely well with a benchmark calculation, which none of the\nprior methods of studying the problem achieved. The second model problem\ninvolves 100 bosons in a shifted harmonic trap. Breathing oscillations in the\n1-body density are calculated and shown to compare favourably to a\nmulticonfigurational time-dependent Hartree for bosons calculation,\ndemonstrating the applicability of the method as a new formally exact way to\nstudy the quantum dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Nov 2018 10:56:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2018 16:40:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 28 Jun 2019 16:40:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-17"}

The key feature in redundancy\nscheduling is replication of a job upon arrival by dispatching replicas to\ndifferent servers. Redundant copies are abandoned as soon as the first of these\nreplicas finishes service. By creating multiple service opportunities,\nredundancy scheduling increases the chance of a fast response from a server\nthat is quick to provide service, and mitigates the risk of a long delay\nincurred when a single selected server turns out to be slow.\n  The diversity enabled by redundant requests has been found to strongly\nimprove the response time performance, especially in case of highly variable\nservice requirements. Analytical results for redundancy scheduling are\nunfortunately scarce however, and even the stability condition has largely\nremained elusive so far, except for exponentially distributed service\nrequirements. In order to gain further insight in the role of the service\nrequirement distribution, we explore the behavior of redundancy scheduling for\nscaled Bernoulli service requirements. We establish a sufficient stability\ncondition for generally distributed service requirements and we show that, for\nscaled Bernoulli service requirements, this condition is also asymptotically\nnearly necessary. This stability condition differs drastically from the\nexponential case, indicating that the stability condition depends on the\nservice requirements in a sensitive and intricate manner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Nov 2018 12:12:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-24"}

One of the evident strengths, when compared to other\nsmall-signal methods, is the natural association with circuit theory. This\nmakes them possible to be connected through basic circuit laws. However,\ncareful attention should be paid when making this association since the\nimpedances obtained through linearization are local variables, often referred\nto locally defined reference frames. To allow the operations of these\nimpedances using basic circuit laws, a unified reference has to be defined.\nThough this issue was properly addressed on the state-space models, a thorough\nanalysis and a clarification regarding the unified impedances and stability\neffects are still missing. This paper aims to bridge this gap by introducing\nthe Impedance Operator (IO) and associated properties to the development of\nimpedance networks. First, the IO for both the AC coupled and AC/DC coupled\nsystems are presented and verified through impedance measurements in PSCAD.\nThen, three types of impedance network-based stability criterions are presented\nalong with a clarification on the consistency of stability conclusions.\nFinally, the Nyquist-based analysis is explored, regarding the sensitivity to\npartition points, to open the discussion on the identification of systems weak\npoints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Nov 2018 13:11:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-16"}

We address this question by studying\nsystems formed by a solar-like star and a close-in planet. We focus on the\nstellar wind spinning down the star along its main sequence phase and tidal\ninteraction causing orbital evolution of the systems. Despite recent\nsignificant advances in these fields, all current models use parametric\ndescriptions to study at least one of these effects. Our objective is to\nintroduce simultaneously ab-initio prescriptions of the tidal and braking\ntorques, so as to improve our understanding of the underlying physics. We\ndevelop a 1D numerical model of coplanar circular star-planet systems taking\ninto account stellar structural changes, wind braking and tidal interaction and\nimplement it in a code called ESPEM. We follow the secular evolution of the\nstellar rotation assuming a bi-layer internal structure, and of the semi-major\naxis of the orbit. After comparing our predictions to recent observations and\nmodels, we perform tests to emphasize the contribution of ab-initio\nprescriptions. Our secular model of stellar wind braking reproduces well the\nrecent observations of stellar rotation in open clusters. Our results show that\na planet can affect the rotation of its host star and that the resulting\nspin-up or spin-down depends on the orbital semi-major axis and on the joint\ninfluence of magnetic and tidal effects. The ab-initio prescription for tidal\ndissipation that we used predicts fast outward migration of massive planet\norbiting fast-rotating young stars. Finally, we provide the reader with a\ncriterion based on the system's characteristics that allows us to assess\nwhether or not the planet will undergo orbital decay due to tidal interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Nov 2018 14:06:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-16"}

Both functionals are shown to give\nresults in good agreement with experimental measurements. Such a consistency\nbetween the two functionals may seem a bit surprising, as the LDA is known to\noverbind and the GGA to soften the interatomic bonds. Such features ought to\ngreatly affect the value of the system interatomic force constants (IFCs) which\nare necessary for the first-principle prediction of the lattice thermal\nconductivity.

Studies of faint, high-redshift star-forming galaxies, in\nmost cases, fail to detect enough escaping ionizing radiation to sustain the\nprocess. Recently, the capacity of bright quasi-stellar objects to ionize their\nsurrounding medium has been confirmed also for faint active galactic nuclei\n(AGNs), which were found to display an escaping fraction of ~74% at z~4. Such\nlevels of escaping radiation could sustain the required UV background, given\nthe number density of faint AGNs is adequate. Thus, it is mandatory to\naccurately measure the luminosity function of faint AGNs (L~L*) in the same\nredshift range. For this reason we have conducted a spectroscopic survey, using\nthe wide field spectrograph IMACS at the 6.5m Baade Telescope, to determine the\nnature of our sample of faint AGN candidates in the COSMOS field. This sample\nwas assembled using photometric redshifts, color, and X-ray information.

When agents are\nat distance at most $\\epsilon$, for some positive constant $\\epsilon$ unknown\nto them, they can exchange all information.

One of the determinants of\nan individual's behavior is the various activities undertaken at various\ntimes-of-the-day and days-of-the-week. In many cases, such behavior will follow\ntemporal patterns. Currently, researchers use either equal or unequal\ninterval-based segmentation of time for mining mobile phone users' behavior.\nMost of them take into account static temporal coverage of 24-h-a-day and few\nof them take into account the number of incidences in time-series data.\nHowever, such segmentations do not necessarily map to the patterns of\nindividual user activity and subsequent behavior because of not taking into\naccount the diverse behaviors of individuals over time-of-the-week.

Approximate expression for the stability of the\nnon-oscillatory stationary state is derived on the basis of the generalized\nfree energy of the system. We show that an effective wavenumber of the system\ndetermined by the spatial arrangement of the active and inactive oscillators is\nan decisive factor in the suppression, in addition to the ratio of active\npopulation to inactive population and relative intensity of each population.\nThe effectiveness of the proposed theory is illustrated with a cortico-thalamic\nmodel of epileptic seizures, where active and inactive oscillators correspond\nto epileptic foci and healthy cerebral cortex tissue, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Nov 2018 12:24:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-22"}

These results are mainly attributed to the\nomni-directional anchoring of the isotropically oriented BP molecules at the\npolymer walls of the hexagonal microwells and at the top and bottom substrates.\nThis leads to an omni-directional stabilization of the entire BPLC system. This\nstudy not only provides a novel insight into the mechanism for the BP formation\nin the 2D microwell but also points to an improved route to stabilize BP using\n2D microwell arrays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2018 16:47:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-27"}
