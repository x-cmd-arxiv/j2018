For box sizes smaller than a certain\nlarge value, flocking appears continuously from a uniform disordered state at a\ncritical value of the noise. Because of mass conservation, the amplitude\nequations describing the flocking state consist of a scalar equation for the\ndensity disturbance from the homogeneous particle density (particle number\ndivided by box area) and a vector equation for a current density. These two\nequations contain two time scales. At the shorter scale, they are a hyperbolic\nsystem in which time and space scale in the same way. At the longer, diffusive,\ntime scale, the equations are parabolic. The bifurcating solution depends on\nthe angle and is uniform in space as in the normal form of the usual pitchfork\nbifurcation. We show that linearization about the latter solution is described\nby a Klein-Gordon equation in the hyperbolic time scale.

For given average sensing\ntime, OAS reduces the MSE compared to non-adaptive schemes, when the signal is\nsparse.

From the observational point of view\nthis structure approximates the configuration of a binary-like system in linear\norbit interconnected by a huge filamentary structure which, if confirmed, it\nwould be the first case to date observed at z > 0.07. Given the importance to\ndisentangle this issue, a follow-up analysis has been performed on the region\nconstrained by the common envelop of the two superclusters in order to search\nfor new hints to confirm their mutual gravitational interaction. Observational\nsignatures of that interaction have been found mapping the inner peculiar\nmotions where the observed negative peculiar velocities measured within the\nA2142 (supercluster) region suggest a general matter flow toward the Corona\nBorealis supercluster. Besides, analyzing the effects on both superclusters due\nto the mutual impact of the external tidal forces, turns out that their inner\ndynamics remain unperturbed up to the turnaround radii. Outside, where the\nbinding forces are overlapped by the tidal ones, the outskirts of both\nsuperclusters should be unstable and subject to fragmentation. Such a scenario\nindicates that both superclusters interact with comparable and reciprocal tidal\nperturbations leaving the whole system in a substantial dynamical equilibrium.\nThe origin of such a dynamical dichotomy would be explained either by a much\nmore massive Corona Borealis supercluster than that estimated in the present\nwork or by a selection effect biasing the small sample of peculiar velocities\ndue to the remoteness of the system worsened by the large uncertainty on their\nmeasurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Nov 2018 17:25:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Nov 2018 14:55:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-30"}

The dynamics of small grains\nin the disc is stiffly coupled to the gas, while the dynamics of grown solids\nis decoupled. Moreover, in some parts of the disc the concentration of the dust\nis low (dust to gas mass ratio is about 0.01), while in other parts it can be\nmuch higher. These factors place high requirements on the numerical methods for\ndisc simulations. In particular, when gas and dust are simulated with two\ndifferent fluids, explicit methods require very small timestep (must be less\nthan dust stopping time $t_{\\rm stop}$ during which the velocity of a solid\nparticle is equalized with respect to the gas velocity) to obtain solution,\nwhile some implicit methods requires high temporal resolution to obtain\nacceptable accuracy.

The remainder term also teaches us exactly how well we need to\nestimate the nuisance parameters (outcome model and treatment mechanism) to\nguarantee asymptotic efficiency. Through simulations we verify theoretical\nproperties of the estimator and show the importance of machine learning over\nconventional regression approaches to fitting the nuisance parameters. We also\nderive the bias and variance of the estimator, the orders of which are\nanalogous to a kernel density estimator. This estimator opens up the\npossibility of developing methodology for optimal choice of the kernel and\nbandwidth to form confidence bounds for the CDF itself.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Nov 2018 18:21:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2018 07:47:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 30 Nov 2018 20:15:32 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 26 Dec 2018 22:47:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-31"}

Each MUSE-Wide pointing has a depth\nof 1 hour and hence targets more extreme and more luminous objects over 10\ntimes the area of the MUSE-Deep fields (Bacon et al. 2017). The legacy value of\nMUSE-Wide lies in providing \"spectroscopy of everything\" without photometric\npre-selection. We describe the data reduction, post-processing and PSF\ncharacterization of the first 44 CANDELS/GOODS-S MUSE-Wide pointings released\nwith this publication. Using a 3D matched filtering approach we detected 1,602\nemission line sources, including 479 Lyman-$\\alpha$ (Lya) emitting galaxies\nwith redshifts $2.9 \\lesssim z \\lesssim 6.3$. We cross-match the emission line\nsources to existing photometric catalogs, finding almost complete agreement in\nredshifts and stellar masses for our low redshift (z < 1.5) emitters. At high\nredshift, we only find ~55% matches to photometric catalogs. We encounter a\nhigher outlier rate and a systematic offset of $\\Delta$z$\\simeq$0.2 when\ncomparing our MUSE redshifts with photometric redshifts. Cross-matching the\nemission line sources with X-ray catalogs from the Chandra Deep Field South, we\nfind 127 matches, including 10 objects with no prior spectroscopic\nidentification. Stacking X-ray images centered on our Lya emitters yielded no\nsignal; the Lya population is not dominated by even low luminosity AGN.

Some will be\ntransiting, but most lack sufficient follow-up observations to confidently\ndetect (or rule out) transits. We use published stellar, orbital, and planetary\nparameters to estimate the transit probabilities for nearly all exoplanets that\nhave been discovered via the RV method. From these probabilities, we predict\nthat $25.5^{+0.7}_{-0.7}$ of the known RV exoplanets should transit their host\nstars. This prediction is more than double the amount of RV exoplanets that are\ncurrently known to transit. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)\npresents a valuable opportunity to explore the transiting nature of many of the\nknown RV exoplanet systems. Based on the anticipated pointing of TESS during\nits two-year primary mission, we identify the known RV exoplanets that it will\nobserve and predict that $11.7^{+0.3}_{-0.3}$ of them will have transits\ndetected by TESS. However, we only expect the discovery of transits for $\\sim$3\nof these exoplanets to be novel (i.e., not previously known).

Here, we provide a modern quantitative\nassessment of those relations, by modelling the rotation curves of galaxies\nfrom the Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves (SPARC) database with\nthe Einasto dark halo model. We focus in particular on the comparison between\nthe original SPARC parameters, with constant mass-to-light ratios for bulges\nand disks, and the parameters for which galaxies follow the tightest radial\nacceleration relation. We show that fits are improved in the second case, and\nthat the pure halo scaling relations also become tighter. We report that the\ndensity at the radius where the slope is -2 is strongly anticorrelated to this\nradius, and to the Einasto index. The latter is close to unity for a large\nnumber of galaxies, indicative of large cores. In terms of dark matter-baryon\nscalings, we focus on relations between the core properties and the extent of\nthe baryonic component, which are relevant to the cusp-core transformation\nprocess. We report a positive correlation between the core size of halos with\nsmall Einasto index and the stellar disk scale-length, as well as between the\naveraged dark matter density within 2 kpc and the baryon-induced rotational\nvelocity at that radius. This finding is related to the consequence of the\nradial acceleration relation on the diversity of rotation curve shapes,\nquantified by the rotational velocity at 2 kpc. While a tight radial\nacceleration relation slightly decreases the observed diversity compared to the\noriginal SPARC parameters, the diversity of baryon-induced accelerations at 2\nkpc is sufficient to induce a large diversity, incompatible with current\nhydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation, while maintaining a tight\nradial acceleration relation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Nov 2018 19:00:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Jan 2019 16:33:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-20"}

In\nPaper I, Cally & Khomenko (2015) have shown that in a weakly ionized plasma,\nsuch as the solar photosphere and chromosphere, the Hall current introduces a\nnew coupling mechanism. The present study extends the results from Paper I to\nthe case of warm plasma. We report on numerical experiments where mode\ntransformation is studied using quasi-realistic stratification in thermodynamic\nparameters resembling the solar atmosphere. This redresses the limitation of\nthe cold plasma approximation assumed in Paper I, in particular allowing the\ncomplete process of coupling between fast and slow magneto-acoustic modes and\nsubsequent coupling of the fast mode to the Alfv\\'en mode through the Hall\ncurrent. Our results confirm the efficacy of the mechanism proposed in Paper I\nfor the solar case. We observe that the efficiency of the transformation is a\nsensitive function of the angle between the wave propagation direction and the\nmagnetic field, and of the wave frequency. The efficiency increases when the\nfield direction and the wave direction are aligned for increasing wave\nfrequencies.

The effective temperature of the star (12500 K) agrees well with\nthose of HgMn (CP3) stars. Furthermore, the main sequence end of its\nevolutionary track also intersects the domain of He-weak CP4 stars. Hence these\nfirst results suggest that HR 62 may be a transition object between the CP4 to\nCP3 subgroup. However, a more detailed analysis of higher resolution spectra at\nshorter wavelengths (< 4380 \\AA{}) is necessary to clearly address the nature\nof this interesting object.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Nov 2018 20:21:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-19"}

The main setting considered is a fixed number\nof vector following a high-dimensional normal distribution with unknown mean\nand diagonal covariance matrix. The diagonal covariance matrix can be known or\nunknown. If the covariance matrix is unknown, the sample size can be as small\nas $2$. The proposed estimator is based on the idea that the unobserved pairs\nof mean and variance for each dimension are drawn from an unknown bivariate\ndistribution, which we model as a mixture of normal-inverse gammas. The mixture\nof normal-inverse gamma distributions provides advantages over more traditional\nempirical Bayes methods, which are based on a normal-normal model. When fitting\na mixture model, we are essentially clustering the unobserved mean and variance\npairs for each dimension into different groups, with each group having a\ndifferent normal-inverse gamma distribution. The proposed estimator of each\nmean is the posterior mean of shrinkage estimates, each of which shrinks a\nsample mean towards a different component of the mixture distribution.\nSimilarly, the proposed estimator of variance has an analogous interpretation\nin terms of sample variances and components of the mixture distribution. If\ndiagonal covariance matrix is known, then the sample size can be as small as\n$1$, and we treat the pairs of known variance and unknown mean for each\ndimension as random observations coming from a flexible mixture of\nnormal-inverse gamma distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Nov 2018 21:49:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-07"}

This formulation describes the momentum,\nviscosity, and incompressibility of the fluid-structure system in Eulerian\nform, and it uses Lagrangian coordinates to describe the structural\ndeformations, stresses, and resultant forces. Integral transforms with Dirac\ndelta function kernels connect the Eulerian and Lagrangian frames. The fluid\nand the structure are both typically treated as incompressible materials. Upon\ndiscretization, however, the incompressibility of the structure is only\nmaintained approximately. To obtain an immersed method for incompressible\nhyperelastic structures that is robust under large structural deformations, we\nintroduce a volumetric energy in the solid region that stabilizes the\nformulation and improves the accuracy of the numerical scheme. This formulation\naugments the discrete Lagrange multiplier for the incompressibility constraint,\nthereby improving the original method's accuracy.

The explicit construction of corresponding Weyl-like\nstar products is given.

Most\ndata-efficient exploration methods require significant computation, typically\nrelying on a learned model to guide exploration. Least-squares methods have the\npotential to provide some of the data-efficiency benefits of model-based\napproaches -- because they summarize past interactions -- with the computation\ncloser to that of model-free approaches.

Complete mixing over a certain distance beyond the\nconvective boundary (Stothers \\& Chin 1985) and an exponentially decaying\ndiffusion outside the convection zone (Herwig 2000) are commonly adopted for\nthe overshoot mixing. Recently, Li (2012, 2017) developed the $k$-$\\omega$\nmodel, which can be used in both convection zones and overshooting regions. We\nincorporated it in calculations of $30M_{\\odot}$ stellar models. We find that\nin the main sequence stage, models with the $k$-$\\omega$ model are almost\nidentical to models with complete mixing in the overshooting region beyond the\nconvective core, and the overshooting in the $k$-$\\omega$ model is equivalent\nto an overshooting distance of about $0.15H_P$. In the post main sequence\nstage, we find that the overshooting below the bottom of the intermediate\nconvection zone beyond the hydrogen-burning shell can significantly restrict\nthe size of the hydrogen-depleted core, and can penetrate effectively into the\nhydrogen-burning shell.

Great advances have been made\nfor the deep networks, but small objects detection is still a challenging task.\nIn order to solve this problem, majority of existing methods utilize\ncomplicated network or bigger image size, which generally leads to higher\ncomputation cost. The proposed network model is referred to as modular feature\nfusion detector (MFFD), using a fast and efficient network architecture for\ndetecting small objects. The contribution lies in the following aspects: 1) Two\nbase modules have been designed for efficient computation: Front module reduce\nthe information loss from raw input images; Tinier module decrease model size\nand computation cost, while ensuring the detection accuracy. 2) By stacking the\nbase modules, we design a context features fusion framework for multi-scale\nobject detection. 3) The propose method is efficient in terms of model size and\ncomputation cost, which is applicable for resource limited devices, such as\nembedded systems for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS).

However, most of\nthe existing rate adaptation approaches for ABR are content-agnostic, without\nconsidering the semantic information of the video content. Nevertheless,\nsemantic information largely determines the informativeness and interestingness\nof the video content, and consequently affects the QoE for video streaming. One\ncommon case is that the user may expect higher quality for the parts of video\ncontent that are more interesting or informative so as to reduce video\ndistortion and information loss, given that the overall bitrate budgets are\nlimited. This creates two main challenges for such a problem: First, how to\ndetermine which parts of the video content are more interesting? Second, how to\nallocate bitrate budgets for different parts of the video content with\ndifferent significances? To address these challenges, we propose a\nContent-of-Interest (CoI) based rate adaptation scheme for ABR. We first design\na deep learning approach for recognizing the interestingness of the video\ncontent, and then design a Deep Q-Network (DQN) approach for rate adaptation by\nincorporating video interestingness information.

We do so by merging 2D\nvisual cues, 3D object dimensions, and ground plane constraints to produce\nboxes that are robust against small errors and incorrect predictions. First, we\ntrain a single-shot convolutional neural network (CNN) that produces multiple\nvisual and geometric cues of interest: 2D bounding boxes, 2D keypoints of\ninterest, coarse object orientations and object dimensions. Subsets of these\ncues are then used to poll probable ground planes from a pre-computed database\nof ground planes, to identify the \"best fit\" plane with highest consensus. Once\nidentified, the \"best fit\" plane provides enough constraints to successfully\nconstruct the desired 3D detection box, without directly predicting the 6DoF\npose of the object. The entire ground plane polling (GPP) procedure is\nconstructed as a non-parametrized layer of the CNN that outputs the desired\n\"best fit\" plane and the corresponding 3D keypoints, which together define the\nfinal 3D bounding box. Doing so allows us to poll thousands of different ground\nplane configurations without adding considerable overhead, while also creating\na single CNN that directly produces the desired output without the need for\npost processing. We evaluate our method on the 2D detection and orientation\nestimation benchmark from the challenging KITTI dataset, and provide additional\ncomparisons for 3D metrics of importance.

Turbulence\naugmentation is due to the enhancement of fluctuations by wakes behind\nparticles, whereas turbulence attenuation is considered to result from the\nincreased dissipation due to the particle drag. In order to examine the\nturbulence attenuation mechanism, Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of a\nparticle-gas suspension are carried out at a Reynolds number of about 3333\nbased on the average gas velocity $\\bar{u}$, channel width $h$, and the gas\nkinematic viscosity. The particle Reynolds number based on the particle\ndiameter $d_p$, gas kinematic viscosity and the flow velocity $\\bar{u}$ is\nabout 42 and the Stokes number is in the range $7-450$. The particle volume\nfraction is in the range $0-2 \\times 10^{-3}$, and the particle mass loading is\nin the range $0-9$. As the volume fraction is increased, a discontinuous\ndecrease in the turbulent velocity fluctuations is observed at a critical\nvolume fraction. from $9 \\times 10^{-4}$ to $1 \\times 10^{-3}$. There is a\nreduction, by one order of magnitude, in the mean square fluctuating velocities\nin all directions and in the Reynolds stress. Though there is a modest increase\nin the energy dissipation due to particle drag, this increase is smaller than\nthe decrease in the turbulent energy production; moreover, there is a decrease\nin the total energy dissipation rate when there is turbulence collapse. Thus,\nturbulence attenuation appears to be due to a disruption of the turbulence\nproduction mechanism, and not due to the increased dissipation due to the\nparticles. There is a discontinuous collapse in the turbulence intensities at a\ncritical particle loading, instead of the continuous decrease as the particle\nloading is increased.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Nov 2018 07:48:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-19"}

This process of learning from demonstrations, and the study of\nalgorithms to do so, is called imitation learning. This work provides an\nintroduction to imitation learning. It covers the underlying assumptions,\napproaches, and how they relate; the rich set of algorithms developed to tackle\nthe problem; and advice on effective tools and implementation.\n  We intend this paper to serve two audiences. First, we want to familiarize\nmachine learning experts with the challenges of imitation learning,\nparticularly those arising in robotics, and the interesting theoretical and\npractical distinctions between it and more familiar frameworks like statistical\nsupervised learning theory and reinforcement learning. Second, we want to give\nroboticists and experts in applied artificial intelligence a broader\nappreciation for the frameworks and tools available for imitation learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Nov 2018 09:06:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-19"}

Flows through medical devices are\ncharacterized by moderate Reynolds numbers and typically involve different flow\nregimes such as laminar, transitional, and turbulent flows. Previous studies\nfor the FDA benchmark nozzle model revealed limitations of Reynolds-averaged\nNavier-Stokes turbulence models when applied to more complex flow scenarios.\nRecent works based on large-eddy simulation approaches indicate that these\nlimitations can be overcome but also highlight potential limitations due to a\nhigh sensitivity with respect to numerical parameters. The novel methodology\npresented in this work is based on two key ingredients. Firstly, we use\nhigh-order discontinuous Galerkin methods for discretization in space yielding\na discretization approach that is robust, accurate, and generic. The inherent\ndissipation properties of high-order discontinuous Galerkin discretizations\nrender this approach well-suited for transitional and turbulent flow\nsimulations. Secondly, a precursor simulation approach is applied in order to\ncorrectly predict the inflow boundary condition for the whole range of laminar,\ntransitional, and turbulent flow regimes. This approach eliminates the need to\nfit parameters of the numerical solution approach. We investigate the whole\nrange of Reynolds numbers as suggested by the FDA benchmark nozzle problem in\norder to critically assess the predictive capabilities of the solver. The\nresults presented in this study are compared to experimental data obtained by\nparticle image velocimetry demonstrating that the approach is capable of\ncorrectly predicting the flow for different flow regimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Nov 2018 11:03:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-19"}

Using a pair of high-resolution\nN-body+gas simulations, we investigate the evolution of a gas-rich low-mass\ngalaxy on a highly radial orbit around a massive host galaxy. As the infalling\nlow-mass galaxy passes through the host's corona at supersonic speeds, its\ndiffuse gas outskirts are stripped by ram pressure, as expected. However, the\ncompactness increases rapidly because of bursty star formation in the gas\ntidally driven to the centre. The metal-rich gas produced by supernovae and\nstellar winds is confined by the ram pressure from the surrounding environment,\nleading to subsequent generations of stars being more metal-rich. After the gas\nis depleted, tidal interactions enhance the metallicity further via the\nstripping of weakly bound, old, and metal-poor stars, while the size of the\nsatellite is changed only modestly. The outcome is a metal-rich cE that is\nconsistent with observations.

For DropFilter-PLUS,\nwe find a suitable way to accelerate the learning process based on theoretical\nanalysis. Experimental results on MNIST show that using DropFilter and\nDropFilter-PLUS may improve performance on image classification tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Nov 2018 12:40:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Nov 2018 01:28:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-20"}

This is because they operate on the\nrelated pseudoforest partitions or the dual problem of finding dense subgraphs.\n  We propose an algorithm for converting a partition of $k$ pseudoforests into\na partition of $k+1$ forests in $O(mk\\log k + m \\log n)$ time with a data\nstructure by Brodal and Fagerberg that stores graphs of arboricity $k$. A\nslightly better bound can be given when perfect hashing is used. When applied\nto a pseudoforest partition obtained from Kowalik's approximation scheme, our\nconversion implies a constructive $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm with\nruntime $O(m \\log n \\log \\Gamma\\, \\epsilon^{-1})$ for every $\\epsilon > 0$. For\nfixed $\\epsilon$, the runtime can be reduced to $O(m \\log n)$.\n  Our conversion also implies a near-exact algorithm that computes a partition\ninto at most $\\Gamma+2$ forests in $O(m\\log n \\,\\Gamma \\log^* \\Gamma)$ time. It\nmight also pave the way to faster exact arboricity algorithms.\n  We also make several remarks on approximation algorithms for the\npseudoarboricity and the equivalent graph orientations with smallest maximum\nindegree, and correct some mistakes made in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Nov 2018 13:57:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Dec 2018 17:33:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 25 Apr 2019 13:17:14 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2019 11:50:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-06"}

However, compared with Lamb wave, SH0 wave is less used in\npractice since it is difficult to be excited by using conventional\npiezoelectric transducers. Recently, face-shear piezoelectric mode has been\nrealized in PZT ceramics and several face-shear piezoelectric transducers have\nbeen developed to excite pure SH0 wave in plates. However, when controllable\nradiation pattern of SH0 wave is required, it is found that no mathematical\nbasis is available for designers to optimize the transducer's parameters. In\nthis work, based on the reciprocal theorem of elastodynamics and Huygens'\nprinciple, a theoretical model is proposed to describe the SH0 wave field\ngenerated by arbitrary-shaped face-shear transducers bonded on an infinite\nisotropic plate. It is proved that the wave field generated by a face-shear\ntransducer is equivalent to that generated by uniform in-plane tractions along\nits perimeter. Then the proposed model is applied to two specific cases of a\nsingle square face-shear (d24) PZT wafer and a bidirectional SH0 wave\npiezoelectric transducer(BSH-PT).Explicit analytical expressions for both cases\nare successfully obtained. The accuracy of the obtained analytical model is\nverified by both experiments and FEM simulations. Furthermore, some general\nguidelines based on the analytical model are presented for optimization of the\ntransducer's dimensions. Finally, based on the guidelines, a new bidirectional\nSH0 wave piezoelectric transducer is proposed with very small beam divergence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Nov 2018 14:26:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Feb 2019 14:42:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-13"}

However, a proper evaluation of the\ncooling rate due to CO requires a determination of the populations of many\nlevels, the spontaneous and stimulated radiative de-excitation rates between\nthese levels, and the transfer of the emitted multi-line radiation;\nadditionally, this must be done for three isotopologues. It would be useful to\nhave a simple analytic formulation that avoided these complications; this could\nthen be used in situations where CO plays an important role as a coolant, but\nthe details of this role are not the main concern. We derive such a formulation\nhere, by first considering the two asymptotic forms that obtain in the limits\nof (a) low volume-density and optical depth, and (b) high volume-density and\noptical depth. These forms are then combined in such a way as to fit the\ndetailed numerical results from Goldsmith \\& Langer (1978), which cover low\ntemperatures, and a range of physical conditions where the interplay of thermal\nand sub-thermal excitation, optical-depth effects, and the contributions from\nrare isotopologues, are all important. The fit is obtained using the\nMetropolis-Hastings method, and reproduces the results of GL78 well. It is a\npurely local and analytic function of state --- specifically a function of the\ndensity, $\\rho$, isothermal sound speed, $a$, CO abundance, $X_{_{\\rm CO}}$,\nand velocity divergence, $\\nabla\\cdot{\\boldsymbol\\upsilon}$. As an application,\nwe consider the cooling layer following a slow steady non-magnetic planar\nJ-shock. We show that, if the post-shock cooling is dominated by CO and its\nisotopologues, the thickness of the post-shock cooling layer is very small and\napproximately independent of the pre-shock velocity, $\\upsilon_o$, or pre-shock\nisothermal sound speed, $a_o$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Nov 2018 14:29:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-19"}

We propose a security-driven CAD and manufacturing flow for\nface-to-face (F2F) 3D ICs, along with obfuscation of interconnects.

We consider treasure hunt in geometric terrains with\nobstacles. Both the terrain and the obstacles are modeled as polygons and both\nthe agent and the treasure are modeled as points. The agent navigates in the\nterrain, avoiding obstacles, and finds the treasure when there is a segment of\nlength at most 1 between them, unobstructed by the boundary of the terrain or\nby the obstacles. The cost of finding the treasure is the length of the\ntrajectory of the agent. We investigate the amount of information that the\nagent needs a priori in order to find the treasure at cost $O(L)$, where $L$ is\nthe length of the shortest path in the terrain from the initial position of the\nagent to the treasure, avoiding obstacles. Following the paradigm of algorithms\nwith advice, this information is given to the agent in advance as a binary\nstring, by an oracle cooperating with the agent and knowing the whole\nenvironment: the terrain, the position of the treasure and the initial position\nof the agent. Advice complexity of treasure hunt is the minimum length of the\nadvice string (up to multiplicative constants) that enables the agent to find\nthe treasure at cost $O(L)$.\n  We first consider treasure hunt in regular terrains which are defined as\nconvex polygons with convex $c$-fat obstacles, for some constant $c>1$. A\npolygon is $c$-fat if the ratio of the radius of the smallest disc containing\nit to the radius of the largest disc contained in it is at most $c$. For the\nclass of regular terrains, we establish the exact advice complexity of treasure\nhunt. We then show that advice complexity of treasure hunt for the class of\narbitrary terrains (even for non-convex polygons without obstacles, and even\nfor those with only horizontal or vertical sides) is exponentially larger than\nfor regular terrains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Nov 2018 14:43:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 Jan 2020 12:30:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-07"}

A related target, currently considered unfeasible without quantum\nrepeaters, is overcoming the fundamental rate-distance limit of point-to-point\nQKD.

Such a collision will produce a shock-compressed layer, and a\nstar cluster can then condense out of the dense gas near the centre of the\nlayer. If the clouds are sufficiently massive, the star cluster is likely to\ncontain at least one massive star, which emits ionising radiation, and excites\nan H{\\sc ii} region, which then expands, sweeping up the surrounding neutral\ngas. Once most of the matter in the clouds has accreted onto the layer,\nexpansion of the H{\\sc ii} Region meets little resistance in directions\nperpendicular to the mid-plane of the layer, and so it expands rapidly to\nproduce two lobes of ionised gas, one on each side of the layer. Conversely, in\ndirections parallel to the mid-plane of the layer, expansion of the H{\\sc ii}\nRegion stalls due to the ram-pressure of the gas that continues to fall towards\nthe star cluster from the outer parts of the layer; a ring of dense neutral gas\nbuilds up around the waist of the Bipolar H{\\sc ii} Region, and may spawn a\nsecond generation of star formation.

Several studies (Bi et al., 2006; Lin et al.,\n2008; Sengupta et al., 2016; Caporale et al., 2011; Berry et al., 2017) have\nshown that it is possible to express an optogenetic protein in ganglion cells\nand make them light sensitive.

In particular,\nthe desired ground state of the Higgs potential should be a charge conserving,\nand preferably global, minimum with parity violation at low scales.

Using an extensive set of multi-wavelength and multi-epoch\nobservations we aimed to identify the origin of the previously detected\nasymmetries. We have observed V1247 Ori at three epochs spanning $\\sim678$ days\nusing sparse aperture masking interferometry with Keck/NIRC2 and VLT/NACO. In\naddition, we search for signs of accretion through VLT/SPHERE-ZIMPOL spectral\ndifferential imaging in H$\\alpha$ and R-band continuum. Our SMA sub-millimetre\ninterferometry in 880 $\\mu$m continuum and in the CO(3-2) line allows us to\nconstrain the orientation and direction of rotation of the outer disc. We find\nthe L'-band emission to be dominated by static features which trace\nforward-scattered dust emission from the inner edge of the outer disc located\nto the north-east. In H- and K-band, we see evidence for a companion candidate\nthat moved systematically by 45$^{\\circ}$ within the first $\\sim$345 days. The\nseparation of the companion candidate is not well constrained, but the observed\nposition angle change is consistent with Keplerian motion of a body located on\na 6 au orbit. From the SMA CO moment map, the location of the disc rim, and the\ndetected orbital motion, we deduced the three-dimensional orientation of the\ndisc. We see no indication of accretion in H$\\alpha$ and set upper limits for\nan accreting companion. The measured contrast of the companion candidate in H\nand K is consistent with an actively accreting protoplanet. Hence, we identify\nV1247 Ori as a unique laboratory for studying companion-disc interactions and\ndisc clearing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Nov 2018 15:53:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-19"}

While an effort has been made to axiomatize the former in a\nsequent system, there is currently no proof theory for the latter. Moreover,\nthe extant axiomatization of erotetic evocation fails to capture its defeasible\ncharacter and provides no rules for introducing or eliminating question-forming\noperators.

The isotropic behavior of velocity autocorrelation function (VACF) and mean\nsquared displacement (MSD), seen in the bulk, breaks down due to partial\nconfinement. A distinct trend emerges in the VACF-perpendicular and\nMSD-perpendicular, corresponding to the confined direction, while the trends in\nVACF-parallel and MSD-parallel, corresponding to the other two unconfined\ndirections are seen to be unaffected by the confinement. VACF-perpendicular\ndisplays a minimum, at short timescales, that correlates with the separation\nbetween the reflective walls. The effect of partial confinement on\nMSD-perpendicular is seen to manifest as a transition from diffusive to\nsubdiffusive motion with the transition time correlating with the minimum in\nthe VACF-perpendicular. When compared to the trends shown by MSD and VACF in\nthe bulk, the MSD-perpendicular exhibits subdiffusive behavior and the\nVACF-perpendicular features rapid decay, suggesting that confinement suppresses\nthe role of thermal fluctuations significantly. Repetitive wall-mediated\ncollisions are identified to give rise to the minima in VACF-perpendicular and\nin turn a characteristic frequency in its frequency spectrum.

At\nthe same time, high-order GKS has been developed, such as the two-stage\nfourth-order scheme (S2O4) GKS, and used for laminar flow calculations. In this\npaper, targeting on the high-Reynolds number engineering turbulent flows, an\nimplicit high-order GKS with Lower-Upper Symmetric Gauss-Seidel (LU-SGS)\ntechnique is developed under the S2O4 framework. Based on Vreman-type LES model\nand $k - \\omega$ SST model, a turbulent relaxation time is obtained and used\nfor an enlarged particle collision time in the implicit high-order GKS for the\nhigh-Reynolds number turbulent flows. Numerical experiments include\nincompressible decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence, incompressible\nhigh-Reynolds number flat plate turbulent flow, incompressible turbulence\naround NACA0012 airfoil, transonic turbulence around RAE2822 airfoil, and\ntransonic high-Reynolds number ARA M100 wing-body turbulence.

Through these examples, it is concluded that the\nhigh-order GKS has high accuracy in space and time, especially for smooth\nflows, obtaining more accurate turbulent flow fields on coarse grids compared\nwith second-order GKS.

Meanwhile, most of the previous methods\nrely on complicated structures with given scarce data, which largely limits the\nefficacy of the neural models. In this paper, we exploit a new direction named\ncoarse-to-fine task transfer, which aims to leverage knowledge learned from a\nrich-resource source domain of the coarse-grained AC task, which is more easily\naccessible, to improve the learning in a low-resource target domain of the\nfine-grained AT task.

The theory captures the basic dynamics of\ncarving runs and thus provides a useful tool for assessing the potential and\nlimitations of the carving technique. We also apply the model to simulate runs\non slopes of constant gradient and describe the results. We find that pure\ncarving is possible only on relatively flat slopes, with the critical slope\nangle in the range of 8-20 degrees. The exact value depends mostly on the\ncoefficient of snow friction and to a lesser degree on the sidecut radius of\nthe skis. In wiggly carving runs on slopes of subcritical gradient, the\naerodynamic drag force remains relatively unimportant and the speed stops\ngrowing well below the one achieved in fall-line gliding. This is because the\nincreased g-force of carving turns leads to enhanced snow friction which can\nsignificantly exceed the one found in the gliding. At the critical gradient,\nthe g-force of carving turns becomes excessive. For such and even steeper\nslopes only hybrid turns, where at least some part of the turn is skidded, are\npossible. The carving turns of all alpine racing disciplines are approximately\nsimilar. This is because in the dimensionless equations of the model the\nsidecut radius of skis enters only via the coefficient of the aerodynamic drag\nterm, which always remains relatively small. Simple modifications to the model\nare made to probe the roles of skier angulation and skidding at the transition\nphase of hybrid turns. As expected the angulation gives certain control over\nthe turn trajectory, but does not remove the slope limitations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Nov 2018 17:58:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 16 Dec 2018 10:02:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 11 Apr 2019 17:59:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-12"}
