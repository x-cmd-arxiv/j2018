Every\nstable matching is a min-size popular matching; another subclass of popular\nmatchings that always exist and can be easily computed is the set of dominant\nmatchings. A popular matching $M$ is dominant if $M$ wins the head-to-head\nelection against any larger matching.

In the context of the two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model, such\npolarons are predicted to form around charged dopants in an antiferromagnetic\nbackground in the low doping regime close to the Mott insulating state.\nMacroscopic transport and spectroscopy measurements related to high $T_{c}$\nmaterials have yielded strong evidence for the existence of such quasiparticles\nin these systems. Here we report the first microscopic observation of magnetic\npolarons in a doped Fermi-Hubbard system, harnessing the full single-site spin\nand density resolution of our ultracold-atom quantum simulator. We reveal the\ndressing of mobile doublons by a local reduction and even sign reversal of\nmagnetic correlations, originating from the competition between kinetic and\nmagnetic energy in the system. The experimentally observed polaron signatures\nare found to be consistent with an effective string model at finite\ntemperature. We demonstrate that delocalization of the doublon is a necessary\ncondition for polaron formation by contrasting this mobile setting to a\nscenario where the doublon is pinned to a lattice site.

This line\nwidth can be considerably reduced if the Comptonisation continuum is\nmulti-component rather than single temperature, but such models are highly\ndegenerate.

Here we present an empirical relationship between Mks and\nmass spanning $0.075M_\\odot<M<0.70M_\\odot$. The relation is derived from 62\nnearby binaries, whose orbits we determine using a combination of Keck/NIRC2\nimaging, archival adaptive optics data, and literature astrometry. From their\norbital parameters, we determine the total mass of each system, with a\nprecision better than 1% in the best cases. We use these total masses, in\ncombination with resolved Ks magnitudes and system parallaxes, to calibrate the\nmass-Mks relation. The result can be used to determine masses of single stars\nwith a precision of 2-3%, which we confirm by a comparison to dynamical masses\nfrom the literature. The precision is limited by scatter around the best-fit\nrelation beyond mass uncertainties, perhaps driven by intrinsic variation in\nthe mass-Mks relation or underestimated measurement errors. We find the effect\nof [Fe/H] on the mass-Mks relation is likely negligible for metallicities in\nthe Solar neighborhood (0.0+/-2.2% change in mass per dex change in [Fe/H]).\nThis weak effect is consistent with predictions from the Dartmouth Stellar\nEvolution Database, but inconsistent with those from MESA Isochrones and\nStellar Tracks.

Based on this new expression for\n$Ca_c$, a three-regime theory is formulated to describe the interface\n(in)stability: (i) in Regime I, the growth rate is always negative, thus the\ninterface is stable; (ii) in Regime II, the growth rate remains zero (parallel\ncells), changes from negative to positive (converging cells), or from positive\nto negative (diverging cells), thus the interface (in)stability possibly\nchanges type at some location in the cell; (iii) in Regime III, the growth rate\nis always positive, thus the interface is unstable.

To address the need for efficient and task-independent\nmodel parallelism, we introduce GPipe, a pipeline parallelism library that\nallows scaling any network that can be expressed as a sequence of layers. By\npipelining different sub-sequences of layers on separate accelerators, GPipe\nprovides the flexibility of scaling a variety of different networks to gigantic\nsizes efficiently.

However, such flows are notoriously difficult to model due to\nthe variety of fluid-particle and particle-particle interactions that can\noccur. In this work, we focus on non-Brownian shear-dominated suspensions,\nwhere kinetic collisions are negligible and frictional effects play a dominant\nrole. Under these circumstances, irreversible phenomena such as particle\ndiffusion and migration arise, requiring anisotropic stress models to describe\nthe suspension rheology. On a continuum level, reduced-order models such as the\nsuspension balance model (SBM) or the diffusive flux model are commonly used to\npredict particle migration phenomena. We propose a new method based on a\ntwo-fluid model (TFM), where both the phases are considered as interpenetrating\ncontinua with their own conservation of mass and momentum equations. Without\nemploying the nowadays customary simplifications in applying the SBM, we close\nthe ``full'' TFM instead. Specifically, we show that when an anisotropic stress\nanalogous to that used in the SBM is added to the equilibrium equations for the\nparticle phase, the TFM is able to accurately predict particle migration. Thus,\nthe TFM does not require the assumptions of a steady suspension velocity and a\nStokesian (inertialess) fluid, and the TFM can be easily extended to include\nbuoyancy and even kinetic collisional models.

In this work we compare the UV/optical variations of RL quasars\nin SDSS Stripe 82 to those of several RQ samples, including those matched in\nredshift-luminosity-black hole mass and/or color-magnitude. We find that while\nboth RL and RQ populations appear bluer when they brighten, RL quasars\npotentially show a weaker/flatter dependence on timescale in their color\nvariation. We further find that while both RL and RQ populations on average\nshow similar variation amplitudes at long timescales, fast variations of RL\nsources appear weaker/smaller (at timescales of ~ 25 -- 300 days in the\nobserver's frame), and the difference is more prominent in the g-band than in\nthe r-band. Inhomogeneous disk simulations can qualitatively reproduce these\nobserved differences if the inner accretion disk of RL quasars fluctuates less\nbased on simple toy models. Though the implications are likely model dependent,\nthe discovery points to an interesting diagram that magnetic fields in RL\nquasars may be prospectively stronger and play a key role in both jet launching\nand the stabilization of the inner accretion disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Nov 2018 19:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-27"}

We developed a theoretical model based on\nSelf-Organizing Maps (SOM), where a three-level artificial neural network\nqualitatively incorporates these kinds of alterations observed in brains of\npatients with ASD. Computational simulations of our model indicate that high\nexcitatory states or long distance under-connectivity are at the origins of\ncognitive alterations, as difficulty in categorization and mental rigidity.\nMore specifically, the enlargement of excitatory synaptic reach areas in a\ncortical map development conducts to low categorization (over-selectivity) and\npoor concepts formation. And, both the over-strengthening of local excitatory\nsynapses and the long distance under-connectivity, although through distinct\nmechanisms, contribute to impaired categorization (under-selectivity) and\nmental rigidity. Our results indicate how, together, both local and global\nbrain connectivity alterations give rise to spoiled cortical structures in\ndistinct ways and in distinct cortical areas.

It is a challenging\nproblem to model them jointly. In this paper, we first present a new variant of\nLong Short-Term Memory, namely Relational LSTM, to address the challenge of\nrelation reasoning across space and time between objects. In our Relational\nLSTM module, we utilize a non-local operation similar in spirit to the recently\nproposed non-local network to substitute the fully connected operation in the\nvanilla LSTM. By doing this, our Relational LSTM is capable of capturing long\nand short-range spatio-temporal relations between objects in videos in a\nprincipled way. Then, we propose a two-branch neural architecture consisting of\nthe Relational LSTM module as the non-local branch and a spatio-temporal\npooling based local branch. The local branch is utilized for capturing local\nspatial appearance and/or short-term motion features. The two branches are\nconcatenated to learn video-level features from snippet-level ones which are\nthen used for classification. Experimental results on UCF-101 and HMDB-51\ndatasets show that our model achieves state-of-the-art results among LSTM-based\nmethods, while obtaining comparable performance with other state-of-the-art\nmethods (which use not directly comparable schema).

The key issues are how to extract discriminative\nfeatures and how to design the classification model. In this paper, we first\nleverage a robust feature descriptor, path signature (PS), and propose three PS\nfeatures to explicitly represent the spatial and temporal motion\ncharacteristics, i.e., spatial PS (S_PS), temporal PS (T_PS) and temporal\nspatial PS (T_S_PS). Considering the significance of fine hand movements in the\ngesture, we propose an \"attention on hand\" (AOH) principle to define joint\npairs for the S_PS and select single joint for the T_PS. In addition, the\ndyadic method is employed to extract the T_PS and T_S_PS features that encode\nglobal and local temporal dynamics in the motion. Secondly, without the\nrecurrent strategy, the classification model still faces challenges on temporal\nvariation among different sequences. We propose a new temporal transformer\nmodule (TTM) that can match the sequence key frames by learning the temporal\nshifting parameter for each input. This is a learning-based module that can be\nincluded into standard neural network architecture. Finally, we design a\nmulti-stream fully connected layer based network to treat spatial and temporal\nfeatures separately and fused them together for the final result.

We then\nuse this data to analyze the relationship between memorability and acoustic\nfeatures like harmonicity, spectral skew, and models of cognitive salience; we\nalso assess the relationship between memorability and high-level features with\na dependence on the sound source itself, such as its familiarity, valence,\narousal, source type, causal certainty, and verbalizability.

A novel constrained Tucker\ndecomposition (consTD) technique of synergy extraction is proposed for\nsynergy-based myoelectric control model and compared with state-of-the-art\nmatrix factorisation models.

This is contrast with matrix\nfactorisation models where data are segmented for each DoF and then the\nsynergies often have to be realigned. Moreover, the consTD method offers more\ninformation by providing additional shared synergies, unlike matrix\nfactorisation methods. The extracted control signals were fed to a ridge\nregression to estimate the wrist's kinematics based on real glove data. The\nCoefficient of Determination (R2) for the reconstructed wrist position showed\nthat the proposed consTD was higher than matrix factorisation methods.

However,\ncurrent multi-locus-based methods are insufficient, in terms of computational\ncost and discrimination power, to detect statistically significant interactions\nand they are lacking in the ability of finding diverse genetic effects on\nmultifarious diseases. Especially, multiple statistic tests for high-order\nepistasis ($ \\geq $ 2 SNPs) will raise huge analytical challenges because the\ncomputational cost increases exponentially as the growth of the cardinality of\nSNPs in an epistatic module. In this paper, we develop a simple, fast and\npowerful method, named JS-MA, using the Jensen-Shannon divergence and a\nhigh-dimensional $ k $-mean clustering algorithm for mapping the genome-wide\nmulti-locus epistatic interactions on multiple diseases.

Such photocurrent appears in a direction perpendicular to\nthe light plane of incidence but is absent in the parallel configuration. The\nhelicity dependent photocurrent is significantly reduced for a Bi single layer\nfilm and the effect is nearly absent for a Cu single layer film. Conventional\ninterpretation of the CPGE suggests the existence of spin-momentum locked\nband(s) of a Rashba type in the Cu/Bi bilayer. In contrast to previous reports\non the CPGE studied in other systems, however, the light energy used here to\nexcite the carriers is much larger than the band gap of Bi. Moreover, the CPGE\nof the Cu/Bi bilayer is larger when the energy of the light is larger: the\nhelicity dependent photocurrent excited with a blue light is nearly two times\nlarger than that of a red light. We therefore consider the CPGE of the Cu/Bi\nbilayer may have a different origin compared to conventional systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Nov 2018 08:47:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-08"}

One possible underexplored solution to the faint\nyoung Sun paradox is that the Sun has simply lost a few percent of its mass\nduring its lifetime. If correct, this would slow, or potentially even offset\nthe increase in luminosity expected from a constant-mass model. However, this\nhypothesis is challenging to test.

The\nmultiscale dynamics in UGKS is achieved through the coupled particle transport\nand collision in the particle evolution process within a time step. In this\npaper, under the UGKS framework, we propose an efficient multiscale unified\ngas-kinetic wave-particle (UGKWP) method. The gas dynamics in UGKWP method is\ndescribed by the individual particle movement coupled with the evolution of the\nprobability density function (PDF). During a time step, the trajectories of\nsimulation particles are tracked until collision happens, and the\npost-collision particles are evolved collectively through the evolution of the\ncorresponding distribution function. The evolution of simulation particles and\ndistribution function is guided by evolution of macroscopic variables. The two\ndescriptions on a gas particle, i.e. wave and particle, switch dynamically with\ntime. A new concept of multiscale multi-efficiency preserving (MMP) method is\nintroduced, and the UGKWP method is shown to be an MMP scheme.

The purpose\nis to compute isovector dipole electromagnetic (E1) response and related\nquantities, i.e. integrated dipole cross section and polarizability, and\ncompare with data from photoabsorption and Coulomb excitation experiments. The\nsingle-particle propagator is obtained by solving the Dyson equation, where the\nself-energy includes correlations non-perturbatively through the Algebraic\nDiagrammatic Construction (ADC) method. The particle-hole ($ph$) polarization\npropagator is treated in the Dressed Random Phase Approximation (DRPA), based\non an effective correlated propagator that includes some $2p2h$ effects but\nkeeps the same computation scaling as the standard Hartree-Fock propagator. The\nE1 responses for $^{14,16,22,24}$O, $^{36,40,48,52,54,70}$Ca and $^{68}$Ni have\nbeen computed: the presence of a soft dipole mode of excitation for\nneutron-rich nuclei is found, and there is a fair reproduction of the\nlow-energy part of the experimental excitation spectrum.

On such platforms, advertisers often participate in\nauctions through a proxy bidder, so the standard incentive analyses that are\ncommon in the literature do not apply directly. In this paper, we take the\nperspective of a budget management system that surfaces aggregated incentives\n-- instead of individual auctions -- and compare first and second price\nauctions. We show that theory offers surprising endorsement for using a first\nprice auction to sell individual impressions. In particular, first price\nauctions guarantee uniqueness of the steady-state equilibrium of the budget\nmanagement system, monotonicity, and other desirable properties, as well as\nefficient computation through the solution to the well-studied Eisenberg-Gale\nconvex program. Contrary to what one can expect from first price auctions, we\nshow that incentives issues are not a barrier that undermines the system. Using\nrealistic instances generated from data collected at real-world auction\nplatforms, we show that bidders have small regret with respect to their optimal\nex-post strategy, and they do not have a big incentive to misreport when they\ncan influence equilibria directly by giving inputs strategically. Finally,\nbudget-constrained bidders, who have significant prevalence in real-world\nplatforms, tend to have smaller regrets.

We define $g$ to be densely computable if it has a partial\ncomputable dense description $f$. Several previous authors have studied the\nstronger notions of generic computability and coarse computability, which\ncorrespond respectively to requiring in addition that $g$ and $f$ agree on the\ndomain of $f$, and to requiring that $f$ be total. Strengthening these two\nnotions, call a function $g$ effectively densely computable if it has a partial\ncomputable dense description $f$ such that the domain of $f$ is a computable\nset and $f$ and $g$ agree on the domain of $f$.

This large\ndistance and low temperature suggest that cometary activity is driven by the\nsublimation of a super-volatile ice (e.g.~CO), presumably preserved by K2's\nlong-term residence in the Oort cloud. The mass loss rate can be sustained by\nCO sublimation from an area $\\lesssim 2$ km$^2$, if located near the hot\nsub-solar point on the nucleus. However, while the drag force from sublimated\nCO is sufficient to lift millimeter sized particles against the gravity of the\ncometary nucleus, it is 10$^2$ to 10$^3$ times too small to eject these\nparticles against inter-particle cohesion. Our observations thus require either\na new understanding of the physics of inter-particle cohesion or the\nintroduction of another mechanism to drive distant cometary mass loss. We\nsuggest thermal fracture and electrostatic supercharging in this context.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Nov 2018 15:31:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-30"}

Decomposition of\ntasks into a hierarchical structure holds the potential to significantly speed\nup learning, generalization, and transfer learning. However, the current task\ndecomposition techniques often rely on high-level knowledge provided by an\nexpert (e.g. using dynamic Bayesian networks) to extract a hierarchical task\nstructure; which is not necessarily available in autonomous systems. In this\npaper, we propose a novel method based on Sequential Association Rule Mining\nthat can extract Hierarchical Structure of Tasks in Reinforcement Learning\n(SARM-HSTRL) in an autonomous manner for both Markov decision processes (MDPs)\nand factored MDPs. The proposed method leverages association rule mining to\ndiscover the causal and temporal relationships among states in different\ntrajectories, and extracts a task hierarchy that captures these relationships\namong sub-goals as termination conditions of different sub-tasks. We prove that\nthe extracted hierarchical policy offers a hierarchically optimal policy in\nMDPs and factored MDPs. It should be noted that SARM-HSTRL extracts this\nhierarchical optimal policy without having dynamic Bayesian networks in\nscenarios with a single task trajectory and also with multiple tasks'\ntrajectories. Furthermore, it has been theoretically and empirically shown that\nthe extracted hierarchical task structure is consistent with trajectories and\nprovides the most efficient, reliable, and compact structure under appropriate\nassumptions. The numerical results compare the performance of the proposed\nSARM-HSTRL method with conventional HRL algorithms in terms of the accuracy in\ndetecting the sub-goals, the validity of the extracted hierarchies, and the\nspeed of learning in several testbeds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Nov 2018 02:09:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-21"}

We extended an SD-based organizational\nmemory system, which we have been using in daily work for over seven years now,\nwith MF mechanisms directly embedding them in daily activities, too, and\nenabling us to test and optimize them in real-world scenarios. In this paper,\nwe first present our initial version of MB and discuss success and failure\nstories we have been experiencing with it during three years of practical\nusage. We learned from cognitive psychology that our previous research on\ncontext can be beneficial for MF. Thus, we created an advanced MB version\nespecially taking user context, and in particular context switches, into\naccount. These enhancements as well as a first prototypical implementation are\npresented, too.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Nov 2018 09:29:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-14"}

In the case of colorectal cancer (CRC), disparities\nin survival among non-Hispanic Whites and Blacks are well documented, and\nmechanisms leading to these disparities need to be studied formally. It has\nalso been established that body mass index (BMI) is a risk factor for\ndeveloping CRC, and recent literature shows BMI at diagnosis of CRC is\nassociated with survival. Since BMI varies by racial/ethnic group, a question\nthat arises is whether disparities in BMI is partially responsible for observed\nracial/ethnic disparities in CRC survival. This paper presents new methodology\nto quantify the impact of the hypothetical intervention that matches the BMI\ndistribution in the Black population to a potentially complex distributional\nform observed in the White population on racial/ethnic disparities in survival.\nWe perform a simulation that shows our proposed Bayesian density regression\napproach performs as well as or better than current methodology allowing for a\nshift in the mean of the distribution only, and that standard practice of\ncategorizing BMI leads to large biases. When applied to motivating data from\nthe Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance (CanCORS) Consortium, our\napproach suggests the proposed intervention is potentially beneficial for\nelderly and low income Black patients, yet harmful for young and high income\nBlack populations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Nov 2018 20:21:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-10"}

In contrast to previous studies, we\nconsider the contribution from the divergence of renormalized inverse electron\npermittivity, which enhances Coulomb interaction at longer ranges. Our work\nreveals that the Coulomb potential acquires oscillating terms, which for the\ncharged plane case could lead to a spatial heterostructure. In the resonant\ncase ($\\omega_p = \\Omega$), photoinduced Coulomb interaction becomes attractive\nfor small values of momenta. This Coulomb interaction renormalization could\npotentially lead to instabilities in the electron system, such as\nsuperconductivity and/or charge density waves. We found possible divergence of\nthe electron coupling constant and discuss herein a potential new mechanism of\nsuperconductivity based on electron-electron interaction renormalization via\nthe plasmon oscillating electric field.
