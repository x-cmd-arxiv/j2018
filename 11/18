This kind of variables is\ncharacterized to take as values one-dimensional probability or frequency\ndistributions on a numeric support. The objective function optimized in the\nalgorithm depends on the choice of the distance measure. According to the\nnature of the date, the $L_2$ Wasserstein distance is proposed as one of the\nmost suitable metrics to compare distributions. It is widely used in several\ncontexts of analysis of distributional data. Conventional batch SOM algorithms\nconsider that all variables are equally important for the training of the SOM.\nHowever, it is well known that some variables are less relevant than others for\nthis task. In order to take into account the different contribution of the\nvariables we propose an adaptive version of the DBSOM algorithm that tackles\nthis problem with an additional step: a relevance weight is automatically\nlearned for each distributional-valued variable. Moreover, since the $L_2$\nWasserstein distance allows a decomposition into two components: one related to\nthe means and one related to the size and shape of the distributions, also\nrelevance weights are automatically learned for each of the measurement\ncomponents to emphasize the importance of the different estimated parameters of\nthe distributions. Examples of real and synthetic datasets of distributional\ndata illustrate the usefulness of the proposed DBSOM algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Nov 2018 16:37:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2019 13:12:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 29 Mar 2019 17:06:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-01"}

We treat convolution kernels as nonlinear\nfunctions of the local coordinates of 3D points comprised of weight and density\nfunctions. With respect to a given point, the weight functions are learned with\nmulti-layer perceptron networks and density functions through kernel density\nestimation. The most important contribution of this work is a novel\nreformulation proposed for efficiently computing the weight functions, which\nallowed us to dramatically scale up the network and significantly improve its\nperformance.

One\nparticularly important aspect is whether or not competitors also interact.\nPopulation structures naturally affect sampling such that in a microscopic\ninterpretation of the replicator dynamics in well-mixed populations competing\nindividuals do not interact but do interact in structured populations. In\nsocial dilemmas interactions with competitors invariably inhibit cooperation\nwhile limited local interactions in structured populations support cooperation\nby reducing exploitation through cluster formation. These antagonistic effects\nof population structures on cooperation affect interpretations and the\nconclusions depend on the details of the comparison. For example, in the\nSnowdrift game, spatial structure may inhibit cooperation when compared to the\nreplicator dynamics. However, modifying the replicator dynamics to include\ninteractions between competitors lowers the equilibrium frequency of\ncooperators, which changes the conclusions and space is invariably beneficial,\njust as in the Prisoner's Dilemma. These conclusions are confirmed by\ncomparisons with random matching models, which mimic population structures but\nrandomly reshuffle individuals to inhibit spatial correlations. Finally, the\ndifferences in the dynamics with and without interactions among competing\nindividuals underlies the differences between death-birth and birth-death\nupdating in the spatial Moran process: death-birth supports cooperation because\ncompetitors tend not to interact whereas they tend to do for birth-death\nupdating and hence cooperators provide direct support to competitors to their\nown detriment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Nov 2018 01:41:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-20"}

However, due to unreliable detection, occlusion and\nfast camera motion, tracked targets can be easily lost, which makes MOT very\nchallenging. Most recent works treat tracking as a re-identification (Re-ID)\ntask, but how to combine appearance and temporal features is still not well\naddressed. In this paper, we propose an innovative and effective tracking\nmethod called TrackletNet Tracker (TNT) that combines temporal and appearance\ninformation together as a unified framework. First, we define a graph model\nwhich treats each tracklet as a vertex. The tracklets are generated by\nappearance similarity with CNN features and intersection-over-union (IOU) with\nepipolar constraints to compensate camera movement between adjacent frames.\nThen, for every pair of two tracklets, the similarity is measured by our\ndesigned multi-scale TrackletNet. Afterwards, the tracklets are clustered into\ngroups which represent individual object IDs. Our proposed TNT has the ability\nto handle most of the challenges in MOT, and achieve promising results on MOT16\nand MOT17 benchmark datasets compared with other state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Nov 2018 02:23:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-20"}

However, the\napproaches using global feature correlations fail to capture small, intricate\ntextures and maintain correct texture scales of the artworks, and the\napproaches based on local patches are defective on global effect. In this\npaper, we present a novel feature pyramid fusion neural network, dubbed\nGLStyleNet, which sufficiently takes into consideration multi-scale and\nmulti-level pyramid features by best aggregating layers across a VGG network,\nand performs style transfer hierarchically with multiple losses of different\nscales. Our proposed method retains high-frequency pixel information and low\nfrequency construct information of images from two aspects: loss function\nconstraint and feature fusion. Our approach is not only flexible to adjust the\ntrade-off between content and style, but also controllable between global and\nlocal. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our method can transfer not just\nlarge-scale, obvious style cues but also subtle, exquisite ones, and\ndramatically improves the quality of style transfer. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach on portrait style transfer, artistic style\ntransfer, photo-realistic style transfer and Chinese ancient painting style\ntransfer tasks. Experimental results indicate that our unified approach\nimproves image style transfer quality over previous state-of-the-art methods,\nwhile also accelerating the whole process in a certain extent.

We attempt to address this problem from\nanother angle - not by changing the network structure but by altering the\ntraining method. We show that by temporarily pruning and then restoring a\nsubset of the model's filters, and repeating this process cyclically, overlap\nin the learned features is reduced, producing improved generalization. We show\nthat the existing model-pruning criteria are not optimal for selecting filters\nto prune in this context and introduce inter-filter orthogonality as the\nranking criteria to determine under-expressive filters.

The\nusual AFQMC formalism of Blankenbecler, Scalapino, and Sugar suffers from the\nsign problem with most physical Hamiltonians, as is well known. Building on\nearlier ideas to constrain the paths in auxiliary-field space [Phys. Rev. Lett.\n\\textbf{83}, 2777 (1999)] and incorporating recent developments in\nzero-temperature, canonical-ensemble methods, we discuss how a self-consistent\nconstraint can be introduced in the finite-temperature,\ngrand-canonical-ensemble framework. This together with several other\nalgorithmic improvements discussed here leads to a more accurate, more\nefficient, and numerically more stable approach for finite-temperature\ncalculations. We carry out a systematic benchmark study in the two-dimensional\nrepulsive Hubbard model at $1/8$ doping. Temperatures as low as $T=1/80$ (in\nunits of hopping) are reached. The finite-temperature method is exact at very\nhigh temperatures, and approaches the result of the zero-temperature\nconstrained-path AFQMC as temperature is lowered. The benchmark shows that\nsystematically accurate results are obtained for thermodynamic properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Nov 2018 07:15:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Nov 2018 22:33:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-18"}

In additive Gaussian channel,\nthe chaotic signal is proved to be the optimal coherent communication waveform\nin the sense of using the very simple matched filter to obtain the maximum\nsignal-to-noise ratio. The properties of chaos can be used to reduce simply and\neffectively the Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI) and to achieve low bit error\nrate in the wireless communication system. However, chaotic signals need very\nwide bandwidth to be transmitted in the practical channel, which is difficult\nfor the practical transducer or antenna to convert such a broad band signal. To\nsolve this problem, in this work, the chaotic signal is applied to a radio-wave\ncommunication system, and the corresponding coding and decoding algorithms are\nproposed. A hybrid chaotic system is used as the pulse-shaping filter to obtain\nthe baseband signal, and the corresponding matched filter is used at the\nreceiver, instead of the conventional low-pass filter, to maximize the\nsignal-to-noise ratio. At the same time, the symbol judgment threshold\ndetermined by the chaos property is used to reduce the Inter-Symbol\nInterference (ISI) effect.

In this setting, we study the problem of two camps aiming to\nmaximize adoption of their respective opinions, by strategically investing on\nnodes in the two phases. A node's initial opinion in the second phase naturally\nplays a key role in determining the final opinion of that node, and hence also\nof other nodes in the network due to its influence on them. More importantly,\nthis bias also determines the effectiveness of a camp's investment on that node\nin the second phase. To formalize this two-phase investment setting, we propose\nan extension of Friedkin-Johnsen model, and hence formulate the utility\nfunctions of the camps. There is a tradeoff while splitting the budget between\nthe two phases.

And the complex-sedenions can be\napplied to study the field equations of the four interactions in the classical\nmechanics and quantum mechanics. Further, it is able to extend the field\nequations from the flat space into the curved space described with the\ncomplex-sedenions, by means of the tangent-frames and tensors. The research\nstates that a few physical quantities will make a contribution to certain\nspatial parameters of the curved spaces. These spatial parameters may exert an\ninfluence on some operators (such as, divergence, gradient, and curl),\nimpacting the field equations in the curved spaces, especially the field\nequations of the four quantum-fields in the quantum mechanics.

At the time of its swearing in, the Senate of the 45th Australian\nParliament consisted of nine political parties, the largest number in the\nhistory of the Australian Parliament. Due to the breadth of the political\nspectrum that the Senate represented, the situation presented an interesting\nopportunity for the study of political interactions in the Australian context.\nUsing publicly available Senate voting data in 2016, we quantitatively analyzed\ntwo aspects of the Senate. Firstly, we analyzed the degree to which each of the\nnon-government parties of the Senate are pro- or anti-government. Secondly, we\nanalyzed the degree to which the votes of each of the non-government Senate\nparties are in concordance or discordance with one another. We utilized the\nfully-visible Boltzmann machine (FVBM) model in order to conduct these\nanalyses. The FVBM is an artificial neural network that can be viewed as a\nmultivariate generalization of the Bernoulli distribution. Via a maximum\npseudolikelihood estimation approach, we conducted parameter estimation and\nconstructed hypotheses test that revealed the interaction structures within the\nAustralian Senate. The conclusions that we drew are well-supported by external\nsources of information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Nov 2018 10:34:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-16"}
