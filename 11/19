On the other hand, model-based\nreinforcement learning methods that learn the transition dynamics are more\nsample efficient, but they often suffer from the bias of the transition\nestimation. How to make use of both model-based and model-free learning is a\ncentral problem in reinforcement learning. In this paper, we present a new\ntechnique to address the trade-off between exploration and exploitation, which\nregards the difference between model-free and model-based estimations as a\nmeasure of exploration value. We apply this new technique to the PPO algorithm\nand arrive at a new policy optimization method, named Policy Optimization with\nModel-based Explorations (POME). POME uses two components to predict the\nactions' target values: a model-free one estimated by Monte-Carlo sampling and\na model-based one which learns a transition model and predicts the value of the\nnext state. POME adds the error of these two target estimations as the\nadditional exploration value for each state-action pair, i.e, encourages the\nalgorithm to explore the states with larger target errors which are hard to\nestimate.

The encoder-decoder\nteam choose stochastic encoding and decoding strategies to minimize the average\nprobability of error in transmission, while the jammer chooses a distribution\non the state-space to maximize this probability. The min-max value of this game\nis equivalent to channel coding for a compound channel -- we call this the\nShannon solution of the problem. The max-min value corresponds to finding a\nmixed channel with the largest value of the minimum achievable probability of\nerror. When the min-max and max-min values are equal, the problem is said to\nadmit a saddle-point or von Neumann solution. While a Shannon solution always\nexists, a von Neumann solution need not, owing to inherent nonconvexity in the\ncommunicating team's problem. Despite this, we show that the min-max and\nmax-min values become equal asymptotically in the large blocklength limit, for\nall but finitely many rates. We explicitly characterize this limiting value as\na function of the rate and obtain tight finite blocklength bounds on the\nmin-max and max-min value.

The problem is then decoupled into an HD frame request admission and\nscheduling subproblems and a matching theory game is formulated to solve the\nscheduling subproblem by associating requests from clusters of users to mmWave\nsmall cell base stations (SBSs) for their unicast/multicast transmission.\nFurthermore, for realistic modeling and simulation purposes, a real VR\nhead-tracking dataset and a deep recurrent neural network (DRNN) based on gated\nrecurrent units (GRUs) are leveraged. Extensive simulation results show how the\ncontent-reuse for clusters of users with highly overlapping FoVs brought in by\nmulticasting reduces the VR frame delay in 12\\%.

The surface redshift obtained for the HSs\nalso satisfy the constraints from pulsars RX J0720.4-3125 and 1E 1207.4-5209.\nIt is noteworthy that unlike several other works, we add no modifications to\nthe original form of the Bag model to satisfy these recent observational and\nempirical constraints on NS properties. We also discuss the rotational aspects\nof the HSs by calculating the properties like rotational mass, radius, energy\ndensity, moment of inertia at different angular velocities. The maximum bound\non rotational frequency from the rapidly rotating pulsars like PSR B1937+21 and\nPSR J1748-2446ad are satisfied with the HS configuration.

Previously, a great amount of research focus on the\nalignment of 2D or 3D patterns, especially in the field of computer vision.\nRecently, the alignment of geometric patterns in high dimension finds several\nnovel applications, and has attracted more and more attentions. However, the\nresearch is still rather limited in terms of algorithms. To the best of our\nknowledge, most existing approaches for high dimensional alignment are just\nsimple extensions of their counterparts for 2D and 3D cases, and often suffer\nfrom the issues such as high complexities. In this paper, we propose an\neffective framework to compress the high dimensional geometric patterns and\napproximately preserve the alignment quality. As a consequence, existing\nalignment approach can be applied to the compressed geometric patterns and thus\nthe time complexity is significantly reduced. Our idea is inspired by the\nobservation that high dimensional data often has a low intrinsic dimension. We\nadopt the widely used notion \"doubling dimension\" to measure the extents of our\ncompression and the resulting approximation. Finally, we test our method on\nboth random and real datasets, the experimental results reveal that running the\nalignment algorithm on compressed patterns can achieve similar qualities,\ncomparing with the results on the original patterns, but the running times\n(including the times cost for compression) are substantially lower.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Nov 2018 02:03:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-20"}

Our paper\nis built upon previous works in the field of unsupervised depth and relative\ncamera pose estimation from temporal consecutive video frames using deep\nlearning (DL) models. Our approach uses a hybrid learning framework introduced\nin a recent work called GeoNet, which leverages geometric constraints in the 3D\nscenes to synthesize a novel view from intermediate DL-based predicted depth\nand relative pose. However, the state-of-the-art unsupervised depth and pose\nestimation DL models are exclusively trained/tested on a few available outdoor\nscene datasets and we have shown they are hardly transferable to new scenes,\nespecially from indoor environments, in which estimation requires higher\nprecision and dealing with probable occlusions.

We first built a random graph model to control for factors such as\nnetwork scale, network growth, investment frequency and syndication tendency.\nThen we added a partner-selection mechanism and used two theories to analyze\nthe formation of network structure: relational embeddedness and structural\nembeddedness. After that, we ran simulations and compared the three models with\nthe actual Chinese VC network. To do this we computed the elite-clique's EI\nindex, degree distribution, clustering coefficient distribution and motifs.\nResults show that adding embeddedness theories significantly improved the\nnetwork dynamic model's predictive power, and help us uncover the mechanisms\nthat affect the formation of a small-world industrial network with an\nelite-clique at its center.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Nov 2018 02:51:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-20"}

The approximate optimal threshold depends not only on the spot\nvolatility, but also the jump intensity and the value of the jump density at\nthe origin. Estimation methods for these quantities are then developed, where\nthe spot volatility is estimated by a kernel estimator with thresholding and\nthe value of the jump density at the origin is estimated by a density kernel\nestimator applied to those increments deemed to contain jumps by the chosen\nthresholding criterion. Due to the interdependency between the model parameters\nand the approximate optimal estimators built to estimate them, a type of\niterative fixed-point algorithm is developed to implement them.

Measures of spatial structure and correlation have been\nsuccessfully implemented to elucidate the roles of the mechanisms underpinning\nthe behavior of individuals. In particular, the pair correlation function has\nbeen used across biology, ecology and physics to obtain quantitative insight\ninto a variety of processes. However, naively applying standard pair\ncorrelation functions in the presence of obstacles may fail to detect\ncorrelation, or suggest false correlations, due to a reliance on a distance\nmetric that does not account for obstacles.

A pronounced enhancement of those distributions is\nobserved as the frequency of the electric field passes across the one-photon\nthreshold. Below that threshold the pairs preferentially carry a longitudinal\nmomentum, while above the threshold they tend to carry a transverse momentum.\nSuch momentum sharing has an impact on the number of produced pairs: It grows\nfast with increasing the field frequency below the threshold but it saturates\nat a roughly constant value above it. On the other hand, at the fixed frequency\nabove the one-photon threshold, the number of pairs scales quadratically with\nthe field strength. This typically perturbative scaling holds even for large\nelectric fields. Thus, the validity of the perturbation theory is extended here\nto processes which result in creation of particles with substantial transverse\nmomenta.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Nov 2018 07:08:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-10"}

The\nlog-uniform prior not only interprets the regularization capacity of Gaussian\ndropout in network training, but also underpins the inference of such\nposterior. However, the log-uniform prior is an improper prior (i.e., its\nintegral is infinite) which causes the inference of posterior to be ill-posed,\nthus restricting the regularization performance of VD. To address this problem,\nwe present a new generalization of Gaussian dropout, termed variational\nBayesian dropout (VBD), which turns to exploit a hierarchical prior on the\nnetwork weights and infer a new joint posterior. Specifically, we implement the\nhierarchical prior as a zero-mean Gaussian distribution with variance sampled\nfrom a uniform hyper-prior. Then, we incorporate such a prior into inferring\nthe joint posterior over network weights and the variance in the hierarchical\nprior, with which both the network training and the dropout rate estimation can\nbe cast into a joint optimization problem. More importantly, the hierarchical\nprior is a proper prior which enables the inference of posterior to be\nwell-posed.

Usually, structures are made of components assembled together\nby means of joints whose behavior maybe highly nonlinear. Depending on the\namount of excitation, joints can dramatically change the dynamic behavior of\nthe whole system, and the modelling of this type of constraint is therefore\ncrucial for a correct prediction of the amount of vibration.\n  The solution of the nonlinear equilibrium equations by means of the Harmonic\nBalance Method (HBM) is widely accepted as an effective approach to calculate\nthe steady state forced response in the frequency domain, in spite of Direct\nTime Integration (DTI). The state of the art contact element used to model the\nfriction forces at the joint interfaces is a nodal contact element, where the\nlocal contact compliance is modelled by means of linear springs and Coulomb law\nis used to govern the friction phenomena.\n  In the literature, when the HBM is applied to vibrating systems with joint\ninterfaces and the state-of-the-art contact model is used, an uncoupled\napproach is mostly employed: the static governing equations are solved in\nadvance to compute the pre-stress effects and then the dynamic governing\nequations are solved to predict the vibration amplitude of the system. As a\nresult, the HBM steady-state solution may lead to a poor correlation with the\nDTI solution, where static and dynamic loads are accounted for simultaneously.\n  In this paper, the HBM performances are investigated by comparing the\nuncoupled approach to a fully coupled static/dynamic approach. In order to\nhighlight the main differences between the two approaches, a lumped parameter\nsystem, characterized by a single friction contact, is considered in order to\nshow the different levels of accuracy that the proposed approaches can provide\nfor different configurations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Nov 2018 08:00:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-26"}

Recently, Meta learning algorithm has been confirmed as a promising way\nto improve the ability of learning from few images for computer vision.\nHowever, previous Meta learning approaches expose problems:\n  1) they ignored the importance of attention mechanism for the Meta learner;\n  2) they didn't give the Meta learner the ability of well using the past\nknowledge which can help to express images into high representations, resulting\nin that the Meta learner has to solve few shot learning task directly from the\noriginal high dimensional RGB images.\n  In this paper, we argue that the attention mechanism and the past knowledge\nare crucial for the Meta learner, and the Meta learner should be trained on\nhigh representations of the RGB images instead of directly on the original\nones. Based on these arguments, we propose two methods: Attention augmented\nMeta Learning (AML) and Representation based and Attention augmented Meta\nLearning(RAML). The method AML aims to improve the Meta learner's attention\nability by explicitly embedding an attention model into its network.

This paper proposes a\nnew framework for tool path optimization. It views a family of iso-level curves\nof a scalar function defined over the surface as tool path so that desired tool\npath can be generated by finding the function that minimizes certain energy\nfunctional and different objectives can be considered simultaneously. We use\nthe framework to plan globally optimal tool path with respect to iso-scallop\nand smoothness. The energy functionals for planning iso-scallop, smoothness,\nand optimal tool path are respectively derived, and the path topology is\nstudied too. Experimental results are given to show the effectiveness of the\nproposed methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Nov 2018 09:49:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-20"}

While classical\npopulation coding theory disregards the temporal dimension, recent works have\nargued that trajectories of transient activity can be particularly informative\nabout stimulus identity and may form the basis of computations through\ndynamics. Yet the dynamical mechanisms needed to generate a population code\nbased on transient trajectories have not been fully elucidated. Here we examine\ntransient coding in a broad class of high-dimensional linear networks of\nrecurrently connected units. We start by reviewing a well-known result that\nleads to a distinction between two classes of networks: networks in which all\ninputs lead to weak, decaying transients, and networks in which specific inputs\nelicit strongly amplified transient responses and are mapped onto orthogonal\noutput states during the dynamics. Theses two classes are simply distinguished\nbased on the spectrum of the symmetric part of the connectivity matrix.

This process could be\nimportant in coronal heating because it leads to dissipation of energy at small\nspatial-scale plasma interactions. Meanwhile, small amplitude decayless\noscillations in coronal loops have been discovered recently in observations of\nSDO/AIA. We model such oscillations in coronal loops and study wave heating\neffects, considering a kink and Alfv{\\'e}n driver separately and a mixed driver\nat the bottom of flux tubes. Both the transverse and Alfv{\\'e}n oscillations\ncan lead to the KHI. Meanwhile, the Alfv{\\'e}n oscillations established in\nloops will experience phase mixing. Both processes will generate small\nspatial-scale structures, which can help the dissipation of wave energy.\nIndeed, we observe the increase of internal energy and temperature in loop\nregions. The heating is more pronounced for the simulation containing the mixed\nkink and Alfv{\\'e}n driver. This means that the mixed wave modes can lead to a\nmore efficient energy dissipation in the turbulent state of the plasma and that\nthe KHI eddies act as an agent to dissipate energy in other wave modes.\nFurthermore, we also obtained forward modelling results using the FoMo code. We\nobtained forward models which are very similar to the observations of decayless\noscillations. Due to the limited resolution of instruments, neither Alfv{\\'e}n\nmodes nor the fine structures are observable. Therefore, this numerical study\nshows that Alfv{\\'e}n modes probably can co-exist with kink modes, leading to\nenhanced heating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Nov 2018 10:56:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-16"}

Existing attributed network approaches work well\nwhen the network is consistent in structure and attributes, and nodes behave as\nexpected. But real world networks often have anomalous nodes. Typically these\noutliers, being relatively unexplainable, affect the embeddings of other nodes\nin the network. Thus all the downstream network mining tasks fail miserably in\nthe presence of such outliers. Hence an integrated approach to detect anomalies\nand reduce their overall effect on the network embedding is required.\n  Towards this end, we propose an unsupervised outlier aware network embedding\nalgorithm (ONE) for attributed networks, which minimizes the effect of the\noutlier nodes, and hence generates robust network embeddings. We align and\njointly optimize the loss functions coming from structure and attributes of the\nnetwork.

We give a heuristic\nmotivation for this new method and show numerical examples that indicate its\ngood performance in the localization of anomalies and the alleviation of\nringing artifacts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Nov 2018 11:12:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-20"}

Therefore, the success of many protocols in optical\nquantum information processing relies on the availability of photon states with\na well-defined spatial and temporal mode. Photons in single spatial mode can be\nobtained from nonlinear processes in single-mode waveguides. For the temporal\nmode, the common approach is to engineer the nonlinear processes.

The\ntree's leaves represent the individuals, and the lengths of the adjacent edges\nindicate the individuals' time durations up to some common ancestor. These\nedges are called external branches. We consider typical external branches under\nthe broad assumption that the coalescent has no dust component, and maximal\nexternal branches under further regularity assumptions. As it transpires, the\ncrucial characteristic is the coalescent's rate of decrease $\\mu(b)$, $b\\geq\n2$. The magnitude of a typical external branch is asymptotically given by\n$n/\\mu(n)$, where $n$ denotes the sample size. This result, in addition to the\nasymptotic independence of several typical external lengths hold in full\ngenerality, while convergence in distribution of the scaled external lengths\nrequires that $\\mu(n)$ is regularly varying at infinity. For the maximal\nlengths, we distinguish two cases. Firstly, we analyze a class of\n$\\Lambda$-coalescents coming down from infinity and with regularly varying\n$\\mu$.

This paper focuses on exploring how to\nconvert entropy measurement into fractal dimension for the spatial analysis of\nscale-free urban phenomena using ideas from scaling. Urban systems proved to be\nrandom prefractal and multifractals systems. The entropy of fractal cities\nbears two typical properties. One is the scale dependence.

The RFMIO and its variants encapsulate important properties that\nare relevant to modeling ribosome flow such as the possible evolution of\n\"traffic jams\" and non-homogeneous elongation rates along the mRNA molecule,\nand can also be used for studying additional intracellular processes such as\ntranscription, transport, and more. Here we consider networks of interconnected\nRFMIOs as a fundamental tool for modeling, analyzing and re-engineering the\ncomplex mechanisms of protein production. In these networks, the output of each\nRFMIO may be divided, using connection weights, between several inputs of other\nRFMIOs.

These mathematical properties make\nthese networks highly suitable as models of various phenomena: property (1)\nmeans that the behavior is predictable and ordered, and property (2) means that\ndetermining the optimal weights is numerically tractable even for large-scale\nnetworks.

However, besides nanoparticles, metal nanowires feature several\nadvantages for applications. Their elongation offers a larger interaction\nvolume, their resonances can reach higher quality factors, and their mode\nstructure provides better coupling into integrated hybrid dielectric-plasmonic\ncircuits. It is crucial though, to control the distance of the wire to a\nsupporting substrate, to another metal layer or to active materials with\nsub-nanometer precision. A dielectric coating can be utilized for distance\ncontrol, but it must not degrade the plasmonic properties. In this paper, we\nintroduce a controlled synthesis and coating approach for silver nanowires to\nfulfill these demands. We synthesize and characterize silver nanowires of\naround 70 nm in diameter. These nanowires are coated with nm-sized silica\nshells using a modified St\\\"ober method to achieve a homogeneous and smooth\nsurface quality. We use transmission electron microscopy, dark-field microscopy\nand electron-energy loss spectroscopy to study morphology and plasmonic\nresonances of individual nanowires and quantify the influence of the silica\ncoating.

Synthetic oversampling methods are commonly used to\ntackle these problems by generating the minority class samples to balance the\ndistributions between majority and minority classes. However, many of\noversampling methods are inappropriate that they cannot generate effective and\nuseful minority class samples according to different distributions of data,\nwhich further complicate the process of learning samples. Thus, this paper\nproposes a novel adaptive oversampling technique: EM-based Weighted Minority\nOversampling TEchnique (EWMOTE) for industrial fault diagnostics and\nprognostics. The methods comprises a weighted minority sampling strategy to\nidentify hard-to-learn informative minority fault samples and Expectation\nMaximization (EM) based imputation algorithm to generate fault samples. To\nvalidate the performance of the proposed methods, experiments are conducted in\ntwo real datasets.

In simple terms the action of system A on system B\ndoes not necessarily produce a back-action. We derive general quantum equations\ndescribing the situation and analyze in details their classical correspondence.\nChanging the properties of the environment one can easily change and engineer\nthe resulting interaction. It is tempting to use this for quantum manipulation\nof the systems. However the resulting quantum gate is not always unitary and\nmay induce a loss of quantum coherence.

The direction of spin A\ncontrols the rotation of spin B while spin A is not rotated experiencing no\nback-action from spin B.

At the first stage of its\nevolution the fireball contains gluons as well as $u$ and $d$ quarks. The very\nhigh baryochemical potential inhibits gluons from fragmenting into $u \\bar u$\nand $d \\bar d$, and so they fragment predominantly into $s \\bar s$ pairs. In\nthe hadronization which follows this leads to the strong suppression of pions\nand hence photons, but allows heavy hadrons to be emitted carrying away\nstrangeness. In this manner, the extreme imbalance of hadron to photon content\nprovides a way to enhance the muon content of the air shower.

A lack of interactions can explain how individuals develop depressive\nsymptoms, but depressive symptoms can also explain how individuals engage in\nsocial interactions. Understanding in detail how depression affects\nindividuals' social interaction networks is important to break this vicious\ncycle of social isolation and depression. This article tackles two central\nmethodological challenges in understanding the micro-level mechanisms between\ndepressive symptoms and social interactions. The first contribution is the\napplication of novel data collection strategies that employ RFID sensors to\nrecord behavioral data on interpersonal interaction, which we combine with\nself-reported depressive symptoms and sociometric data on friendship relations.\nThe second contribution is the analysis of these data with statistical social\nnetwork methodology that allows testing hypotheses on the duration of\ninteractions between pairs of individuals. With this unique approach, we test\nfour social network hypotheses in an empirical setting of two first-year\nundergraduate student cohorts (N(pairs) = 2,454, N(individuals) = 123) spending\na weekend together in a remote camp house. We conclude that depressive symptoms\nare associated with (1) spending less time in social interaction, (2) spending\ntime with similarly depressed others, (3) spending time in pair-wise\ninteractions rather than group interactions, and with (4) spending more time\nwith reciprocal friends (but not with unilaterally perceived friends). Our\nfindings offer new insights into social consequences of depressive symptoms and\ncall for the development of social network-oriented intervention strategies to\nprevent depressed individuals from being socially isolated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Nov 2018 14:58:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-20"}

The residual symmetry in the neutrino and up quark sector is a\nKlein group and CP, while a Z_3 and a Z_{16} symmetry are preserved among\ncharged leptons and down quarks, respectively. If the Klein group in the\nneutrino sector is further broken down to a single Z_2 symmetry, we obtain\npredictions for all lepton mixing parameters in terms of one real quantity,\nwhose size is determined by the value of the reactor mixing angle. The Dirac\nand Majorana phases are fixed, in particular sin (delta) = -0.936. A sum rule,\nrelating these CP phases and the reactor and atmospheric mixing angles,\ntheta_{13} and theta_{23}, is given. In the quark sector, we have for the\nCabibbo angle theta_C= sin (pi/16) = 0.195 after the first step of symmetry\nbreaking. This is brought into full accordance with experimental data with the\nsecond step of symmetry breaking, where either the Z_{16} group is broken to a\nZ_8 symmetry in the down quark sector or the Klein group to one Z_2 symmetry\nonly among up quarks.

All three white dwarfs have pure-hydrogen\n(DA) atmospheres, masses of 0.60-0.63 Msun and cooling ages of 40-290 Myr. We\nadopt eight initial-to-final mass relations to estimate the main sequence\nprogenitor masses (which we find to be similar for the three components,\n1.6-2.6 Msun) and lifetimes. The differences between the derived cooling times\nand main sequence lifetimes agree for most of the adopted initial-to-final mass\nrelations, hence the three white dwarfs in J1953-1019 are consistent with\ncoeval evolution. Furthermore, we calculate the projected orbital separations\nof the inner white dwarf binary (303.25 +- 0.01 au) and of the centre of mass\nof the inner binary and the outer companion (6398.97 +- 0.09 au). From these\nvalues, and taking into account a wide range of possible configurations for the\ntriplet to be currently dynamically stable, we analyse the future evolution of\nthe system.

The cost for this nonlinear\nsolver is very low, accounting for only a few percent of the total computation\ntime per time step, because this nonlinear equation is about a scalar number,\nnot a field function. Extensive numerical experiments have been presented for\nseveral two-phase flow problems involving large density ratios and large\nviscosity ratios. Comparisons with theory show that the proposed method\nproduces physically accurate results. Simulations with large time step sizes\ndemonstrate the stability of computations and verify the robustness of the\nproposed method. An implication of this work is that energy-stable schemes for\ntwo-phase problems can also become computationally efficient and competitive,\neliminating the need for expensive re-computations of coefficient matrices,\neven at large density ratios and viscosity ratios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Nov 2018 21:07:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-26"}

The purpose of this study\nwas to evaluate the accuracy of our newly-developed system using a deep\nlearning algorithm for automatic 3D cephalometric annotation. Methods: To\novercome current technical limitations, some measures were developed to\ndirectly annotate 3D human skull data. Our deep learning-based model system\nmainly consisted of a 3D convolutional neural network and image data\nresampling. Results: The discrepancies between the referenced and predicted\ncoordinate values in three axes and in 3D distance were calculated to evaluate\nsystem accuracy. Our new model system yielded prediction errors of 3.26, 3.18,\nand 4.81 mm (for three axes) and 7.61 mm (for 3D). Moreover, there was no\ndifference among the landmarks of the three groups, including the midsagittal\nplane, horizontal plane, and mandible (p>0.05).

Despite the\ntechnological advances in medical imaging, IVD localization and segmentation\nare still manually performed, which is time-consuming and prone to errors. If,\nin addition, multi-modal imaging is considered, the burden imposed on disease\nassessments increases substantially. In this paper, we propose an architecture\nfor IVD localization and segmentation in multi-modal MRI, which extends the\nwell-known UNet. Compared to single images, multi-modal data brings\ncomplementary information, contributing to better data representation and\ndiscriminative power. Our contributions are three-fold. First, how to\neffectively integrate and fully leverage multi-modal data remains almost\nunexplored. In this work, each MRI modality is processed in a different path to\nbetter exploit their unique information. Second, inspired by HyperDenseNet, the\nnetwork is densely-connected both within each path and across different paths,\ngranting the model the freedom to learn where and how the different modalities\nshould be processed and combined. Third, we improved standard U-Net modules by\nextending inception modules with two dilated convolutions blocks of different\nscale, which helps handling multi-scale context. We report experiments over the\ndata set of the public MICCAI 2018 Challenge on Automatic Intervertebral Disc\nLocalization and Segmentation, with 13 multi-modal MRI images used for training\nand 3 for validation.
