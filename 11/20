An\ninternal dataset served as test data, withheld during training. We ran two\nexperiments training CycleGAN on low and higher resolution images ($256 \\times\n256$ px and $512 \\times 408$ px). Three radiologists read the images and rated\nthe likelihood of malignancy on a scale from 1-5 and the likelihood of the\nimage being manipulated. The readout was evaluated by ROC analysis (Area under\nthe ROC curve = AUC). $\\textbf{Results}$ At the lower resolution, only one\nradiologist exhibited markedly lower detection of cancer (AUC=0.85 vs 0.63,\np=0.06), while the other two were unaffected (0.67 vs. 0.69 and 0.75 vs. 0.77,\np=0.55). Only one radiologist could discriminate between original and modified\nimages slightly better than guessing/chance (0.66, p=0.008). At the higher\nresolution, all radiologists showed significantly lower detection rate of\ncancer in the modified images (0.77-0.84 vs. 0.59-0.69, p=0.008), however, they\nwere now able to reliably detect modified images due to better visibility of\nartifacts (0.92, 0.92 and 0.97). $\\textbf{Conclusion}$ A CycleGAN can\nimplicitly learn malignant features and inject or remove them so that a\nsubstantial proportion of small mammographic images would consequently be\nmisdiagnosed. At higher resolutions, however, the method is currently limited\nand has a clear trade-off between manipulation of images and introduction of\nartifacts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:08:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-20"}

Atmospheric convection, one of the most important components of the\nclimate system, is by comparison complicated and poorly understood. A key\nattribute of atmospheric convection is the buoyancy source provided by the\ncondensation of water vapour, but the presence of radiation, compressibility,\nliquid water and ice further complicate the system and our understanding of it.\nIn this paper we present an idealized model of moist convection by taking the\nBoussinesq limit of the ideal gas equations and adding a condensate that obeys\na simplified Clausius--Clapeyron relation. The system allows moist convection\nto be explored at a fundamental level and reduces to the classical\nRayleigh-Benard model if the latent heat of condensation is taken to be zero.\nThe model has an exact, Rayleigh-number independent `drizzle' solution in which\nthe diffusion of water vapour from a saturated lower surface is balanced by\ncondensation, with the temperature field (and so the saturation value of the\nmoisture) determined self-consistently by the heat released in the\ncondensation. This state is the moist analogue of the conductive solution in\nthe classical problem. We numerically determine the linear stability properties\nof this solution as a function of Rayleigh number and a nondimensional\nlatent-heat parameter. We also present a number of turbulent solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:12:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-30"}

Our focus here is on designing sublinear-time algorithms for approximately\ncounting occurrences of $H$ in $G$ in the setting where the algorithm is given\nquery access to $G$. This problem has been studied in several recent papers\nwhich primarily focused on specific families of graphs $H$ such as triangles,\ncliques, and stars. However, not much is known about approximate counting of\narbitrary graphs $H$. This is in sharp contrast to the closely related subgraph\nenumeration problem that has received significant attention in the database\ncommunity as the database join problem. The AGM bound shows that the maximum\nnumber of occurrences of any arbitrary subgraph $H$ in a graph $G$ with $m$\nedges is $O(m^{\\rho(H)})$, where $\\rho(H)$ is the fractional edge-cover of $H$,\nand enumeration algorithms with matching runtime are known for any $H$.\n  We bridge this gap between subgraph counting and subgraph enumeration by\ndesigning a sublinear-time algorithm that can estimate the number of any\narbitrary subgraph $H$ in $G$, denoted by $\\#H$, to within a $(1\\pm\n\\epsilon)$-approximation w.h.p. in $O(\\frac{m^{\\rho(H)}}{\\#H}) \\cdot\npoly(\\log{n},1/\\epsilon)$ time. Our algorithm is allowed the standard set of\nqueries for general graphs, namely degree queries, pair queries and neighbor\nqueries, plus an additional edge-sample query that returns an edge chosen\nuniformly at random. The performance of our algorithm matches those of Eden\net.al. [FOCS 2015, STOC 2018] for counting triangles and cliques and extend\nthem to all choices of subgraph $H$ under the additional assumption of\nedge-sample queries. We further show that our algorithm works for the more\ngeneral database join size estimation problem and prove a matching lower bound\nfor this problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:29:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-20"}

Modeling\nlocal structure has been proven to be important for the success of\nconvolutional architectures, and researchers exploited the modeling of local\npoint sets in the feature extraction hierarchy. However, limited attention has\nbeen paid to explicitly model the geometric structure amongst points in a local\nregion. To address this problem, we propose Geo-CNN, which applies a generic\nconvolution-like operation dubbed as GeoConv to each point and its local\nneighborhood. Local geometric relationships among points are captured when\nextracting edge features between the center and its neighboring points. We\nfirst decompose the edge feature extraction process onto three orthogonal\nbases, and then aggregate the extracted features based on the angles between\nthe edge vector and the bases. This encourages the network to preserve the\ngeometric structure in Euclidean space throughout the feature extraction\nhierarchy. GeoConv is a generic and efficient operation that can be easily\nintegrated into 3D point cloud analysis pipelines for multiple applications.

We find that for generic values of the theory's three dimensionless\ncoupling constants, slowly moving black holes present curvature singularities\nat the universal horizon. Singularities at the spin-0 horizon also arise unless\none waives the requirement of asymptotic flatness at spatial infinity.\nNevertheless, we have verified that at least in a one-dimensional subset of the\n(three-dimensional) parameter space of the theory's coupling constants, slowly\nmoving black holes are regular everywhere, even though they coincide with the\ngeneral relativistic ones (thus implying in particular the absence of dipolar\ngravitational radiation). Remarkably, this subset of the parameter space\nessentially coincides with the one selected by the recent constraints from\nGW170817 and by solar system tests.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:38:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2019 17:18:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 6 Sep 2021 09:03:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-07"}

An\nupper bound on the semantic security information leakage of modular BRI schemes\nin a one-shot setting is derived which separates the effects of the biregular\nirreducible function on the one hand and the error-correcting code plus the\nchannel on the other hand. The effect of the biregular irreducible function is\ndescribed by the second-largest eigenvalue of an associated stochastic matrix.\nA characterization of biregular irreducible functions is given in terms of\nconnected edge-disjoint biregular graphs.

Each class has its own forward and backward dynamic models. The\nevolution of a CM sequence can be described by different models. For example, a\nMarkov sequence can be described by a Markov model, as well as by reciprocal,\n$CM_L$, and $CM_F$ models. Also, sometimes a forward model is available, but it\nis desirable to have a backward model for the same sequence (e.g., in\nsmoothing). Therefore, it is important to study relationships between different\ndynamic models of a CM sequence.

For experiments at hadron colliders, radiation\nhardness is a key requirement which is not fulfilled by standard CMOS sensor\ndesigns that collect charge by diffusion.

We\naddress the problems of partitioning a mixed graph into matching forests or\nmixed edge covers, so that all parts are equal with respect to some criterion,\nsuch as edge/arc numbers or total sizes. Moreover, we provide the best possible\nmulticriteria equalization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Nov 2018 18:18:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2018 10:54:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 10 Feb 2019 21:20:40 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2019 20:33:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-18"}

We\npropose a deep convolutional neural network architecture termed OrthoSeg for\nsemantic segmentation using multimodal, orthorectified and coregistered data.\nWe also propose a training procedure for supervised training of OrthoSeg. The\ntraining procedure complements the inherent architectural characteristics of\nOrthoSeg for preventing complex co-adaptations of learned features, which may\narise due to probable high dimensionality and spatial correlation in multimodal\nand/or multispectral coregistered data. OrthoSeg consists of parallel encoding\nnetworks for independent encoding of multimodal feature maps and a decoder\ndesigned for efficiently fusing independently encoded multimodal feature maps.\nA softmax layer at the end of the network uses the features generated by the\ndecoder for pixel-wise classification. The decoder fuses feature maps from the\nparallel encoders locally as well as contextually at multiple scales to\ngenerate per-pixel feature maps for final pixel-wise classification resulting\nin segmented output. We experimentally show the merits of OrthoSeg by\ndemonstrating state-of-the-art accuracy on the ISPRS Potsdam 2D Semantic\nSegmentation dataset. Adaptability is one of the key motivations behind\nOrthoSeg so that it serves as a useful architectural option for a wide range of\nproblems involving the task of semantic segmentation of coregistered multimodal\nand/or multispectral imagery. Hence, OrthoSeg is designed to enable independent\nscaling of parallel encoder networks and decoder network to better match\napplication requirements, such as the number of input channels, the effective\nfield-of-view, and model capacity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Nov 2018 18:21:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2018 16:45:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-21"}

These synchrotron\nsources are generally classified as radio haloes and radio relics. Whilst it is\ncommonly accepted that mergers play a crucial role in the formation of radio\nhaloes and relics, not all the merging clusters show the presence of giant\ndiffuse radio sources and this provides important information concerning\ncurrent models. The Abell 781 complex is a spectacular system composed of an\napparent chain of clusters on the sky. Its main component is undergoing a\nmerger and hosts peripheral emission that is classified as a candidate radio\nrelic and a disputed radio halo. We used new LOw Frequency ARay (LOFAR)\nobservations at 143 MHz and archival Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT)\nobservations at 325 and 610 MHz to study radio emission from non-thermal\ncomponents in the ICM of Abell 781. Complementary information came from\nXMM-Newton data, which allowed us to investigate the connection with the\nthermal emission and its complex morphology. The origin of the peripheral\nemission is still uncertain. We speculate that it is related to the interaction\nbetween a head tail radio galaxy and shock. However, the current data allow us\nonly to set an upper limit of $\\mathcal{M} < 1.4$ on the Mach number of this\nputative shock. Instead, we successfully characterise the surface brightness\nand temperature jumps of a shock and two cold fronts in the main cluster\ncomponent of Abell 781. Their positions suggest that the merger is involving\nthree substructures. We do not find any evidence for a radio halo either at the\ncentre of this system or in the other clusters of the chain. We place an upper\nlimit to the diffuse radio emission in the main cluster of Abell 781 that is a\nfactor of 2 below the current radio power-mass relation for giant radio haloes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Nov 2018 19:06:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-27"}

The value-added LDR1 catalogue contains Pan-STARRS counterparts, which\nwe match with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR7 and DR12 quasar\ncatalogues. We find that BALQSOs are twice as likely to be detected at\n144$\\,$MHz than their non-BAL counterparts, and BALQSOs with low-ionisation\nspecies present in their spectra are three times more likely to be detected\nthan those with only high-ionisation species. The BALQSO fraction at 144$\\,$MHz\nis constant with increasing radio luminosity, which is inconsistent with\nprevious results at 1.4$\\,$GHz, indicating that observations at the different\nfrequencies may be tracing different sources of radio emission. We cross-match\nradio sources between the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty Centimeters\n(FIRST) survey and LDR1, which provides a bridge via the LDR1 Pan-STARRS\ncounterparts to identify BALQSOs in SDSS. Consequently we expand the sample of\nBALQSOs detected in FIRST by a factor of three. The LDR1-detected BALQSOs in\nour sample are almost exclusively radio-quiet (\\logr $\\,<2$), with radio sizes\nat 144$\\,$MHz typically less than $200\\,$kpc; these radio sizes tend to be\nlarger than those at 1.4$\\,$GHz, suggesting more extended radio emission at low\nfrequencies. We find that although the radio detection fraction increases with\nincreasing balnicity index (BI), there is no correlation between BI and either\nlow-frequency radio power or radio-loudness. This suggests that both radio\nemission and BI may be linked to the same underlying process, but are spatially\ndistinct phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Nov 2018 19:06:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-21"}

Measuring the IGMF is\nimportant to determine its origin (i.e. primordial or otherwise). Using data\nfrom the LOFAR Two Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS), we present the Faraday rotation\nmeasure (RM) and depolarisation properties of the giant radio galaxy\nJ1235+5317, at a redshift of $z = 0.34$ and 3.38 Mpc in size. We find a mean RM\ndifference between the lobes of $2.5\\pm0.1$ rad/m$^2$ , in addition to small\nscale RM variations of ~0.1 rad/m$^2$ . From a catalogue of LSS filaments based\non optical spectroscopic observations in the local universe, we find an excess\nof filaments intersecting the line of sight to only one of the lobes.\nAssociating the entire RM difference to these LSS filaments leads to a gas\ndensity-weighted IGMF strength of ~0.3 {\\mu}G. However, direct comparison with\ncosmological simulations of the RM contribution from LSS filaments gives a low\nprobability (~5%) for an RM contribution as large as 2.5 rad/m$^2$ , for the\ncase of IGMF strengths of 10 to 50 nG. It is likely that variations in the RM\nfrom the Milky Way (on 11' scales) contribute significantly to the mean RM\ndifference, and a denser RM grid is required to better constrain this\ncontribution. In general, this work demonstrates the potential of the LOFAR\ntelescope to probe the weak signature of the IGMF. Future studies, with\nthousands of sources with high accuracy RMs from LoTSS, will enable more\nstringent constraints on the nature of the IGMF.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Nov 2018 19:08:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-27"}

In order to accelerate the\ndiscovery of new superionic conductors is convenient to establish meaningful\nrelations between ionic transport and simple materials descriptors. Recently,\nseveral experimental studies on lithium fast-ion conductors have suggested a\ncorrelation between lattice softness and enhanced ionic conductivity due to a\nconcomitant decrease in the activation energy for ion migration, $E_{a}$. In\nthis article, we employ extensive \\emph{ab initio} molecular dynamics\nsimulations based on density functional theory to substantiate the links\nbetween ionic transport and lattice dynamics in a number of structurally and\nchemically distinct lithium superionic conductors. Our first-principles results\nshow no evidence for a direct and general correlation between $E_{a}$, or the\nhopping attempt frequency, and lattice softness. However, we find that, in\nagreement with recent observations, the pre-exponential factor of lithium\ndiffusivity, $D_{0}$, follows the Meyer-Neldel rule $\\propto\n\\exp{\\left(E_{a}/\\langle \\omega \\rangle\\right)}$, where $\\langle \\omega\n\\rangle$ represents an average phonon frequency. Hence, lattice softness can be\nidentified with enhanced lithium diffusivity but only within families of\nsuperionic materials presenting very similar migration activation energies, due\nto larger $D_{0}$. On the technical side, we show that neglection of\ntemperature effects in first-principles estimation of $E_{a}$ may lead to huge\ninaccuracies of $\\sim 10$\\%.

We used the sample, combined with recently developed analytical models,\nto investigate the lifetime distribution of RLAGN. We show that large or giant\npowerful RLAGN are probably the old tail of the general RLAGN population, but\nthat the low-luminosity RLAGN candidates in our sample, many of which have\nsizes $<100$ kpc, either require a very different lifetime distribution or have\ndifferent jet physics from the more powerful objects. We then used analytical\nmodels to develop a method of estimating jet kinetic powers for our candidate\nobjects and constructed a jet kinetic luminosity function based on these\nestimates. These values can be compared to observational quantities, such as\nthe integrated radiative luminosity of groups and clusters, and to the\npredictions from models of RLAGN feedback in galaxy formation and evolution. In\nparticular, we show that RLAGN in the local Universe are able to supply all the\nenergy required per comoving unit volume to counterbalance X-ray radiative\nlosses from groups and clusters and thus prevent the hot gas from cooling. Our\ncomputation of the kinetic luminosity density of local RLAGN is in good\nagreement with other recent observational estimates and with models of galaxy\nformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Nov 2018 19:27:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-27"}

While at first glance the X-ray images suggest that\nwe are witnessing the first infall of NGC 4839 into the Coma cluster core, we\nargue that a post-merger scenario provides a better explanation of the observed\nfeatures and illustrate this with a series of numerical simulations. In this\nscenario, the tail is formed when the group, initially moving to the\nsouth-west, reverses its radial velocity after crossing the apocenter, the ram\npressure ceases and the ram-pressure-displaced gas falls back toward the center\nof the group and overshoots it. Shortly after the apocenter passage, the\noptical galaxy, dark matter and gaseous core move in a north-east direction,\nwhile the displaced gas continues moving to the south-west. The \"sheath\" is\nexplained as being due to interaction of the re-infalling group with its own\ntail of stripped gas mixed with the Coma gas. In this scenario, the shock,\ndriven by the group before reaching the apocenter, has already detached from\nthe group and would be located close to the famous relic to the south-west of\nthe Coma cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Nov 2018 19:28:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Mar 2019 08:24:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-08"}

We use the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) Data Release 1 catalogues\nto investigate this relationship. We cross-matched 8,745 radio-loud AGN with\n0.08<z<0.4, selected from LoTSS, with two Sloan Digital Sky Survey cluster\ncatalogues, and find that only 10 percent of LoTSS AGN in this redshift range\nhave an association, so that the majority of low-redshift AGN (including a\nsubstantial fraction of the most radio-luminous objects) must inhabit haloes\nwith M < 10^14 M_sun. We find that the probability of a cluster association,\nand the richness of the associated cluster, is correlated with AGN radio\nluminosity, and for the cluster population, the number of associated AGN and\nthe radio luminosity of the brightest associated AGN is richness-dependent. We\ndemonstrate that these relations are not driven solely by host-galaxy stellar\nmass, supporting models in which large-scale environment is influential in\ndriving AGN jet activity. At the lowest radio luminosities we find that the\nminority of objects with a cluster association are located at larger mean\ncluster-centre distances than more luminous AGN, which appears to be driven\nprimarily by host-galaxy mass. Finally, we also find that FRI radio galaxies\ninhabit systematically richer environments than FRIIs. The work presented here\ndemonstrates the potential of LoTSS for AGN environmental studies.

The data taken with these\ninterferometers, for example with the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR), are often\ncalibrated in a low signal-to-noise ratio regime and the removal of critical\nsystematic effects is challenging. The process requires an understanding of\ntheir origin and properties.\n  Aim: In this paper we describe the major systematic effects inherent to next\ngeneration low-frequency telescopes, such as LOFAR. With this knowledge, we\nintroduce a data processing pipeline that is able to isolate and correct these\nsystematic effects. The pipeline will be used to calibrate calibrator\nobservations as the first step of a full data reduction process.\n  Methods: We processed two LOFAR observations of the calibrator 3C196: the\nfirst using the Low Band Antenna (LBA) system at 42-66 MHz and the second using\nthe High Band Antenna (HBA) system at 115-189 MHz.\n  Results: We were able to isolate and correct for the effects of clock drift,\npolarisation misalignment, ionospheric delay, Faraday rotation, ionospheric\nscintillation, beam shape, and bandpass. The designed calibration strategy\nproduced the deepest image to date at 54 MHz. The image has been used to\nconfirm that the spectral energy distribution of the average radio source\npopulation tends to flatten at low frequencies.\n  Conclusions: We prove that LOFAR systematic effects can be described by a\nrelatively small number of parameters. Furthermore, the identification of these\nparameters is fundamental to reducing the degrees of freedom when the\ncalibration is carried out on fields that are not dominated by a strong\ncalibrator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Nov 2018 19:51:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-27"}

We used the LOFAR\nTwo-Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) first data release value-added catalogue (LDR1) to\nstudy blazars in the low-frequency regime with unprecedented sensitivity and\nresolution. We identified radio counterparts to all $98$ known sources from the\nThird \\textit{Fermi}-LAT Point Source Catalogue (3FGL) or Roma-BZCAT\nMulti-frequency Catalogue of Blazars ($5^{\\mathrm{th}}$ edition) that fall\nwithin the LDR1 footprint. Only the 3FGL unidentified $\\gamma$-ray sources\n(UGS) could not be firmly associated with an LDR1 source; this was due to\nsource confusion. We examined the redshift and radio luminosity distributions\nof our sample, finding flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) to be more distant\nand more luminous than BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs) on average. Blazars are\nknown to have flat spectra in the gigahertz regime but we found this to extend\ndown to $144$ MHz, where the radio spectral index, $\\alpha$, of our sample is\n$-0.17 \\pm 0.14$. For BL Lacs, $\\alpha = -0.13 \\pm 0.16$ and for FSRQs, $\\alpha\n= -0.15 \\pm 0.17$. We also investigated the radio-to-$\\gamma$-ray connection\nfor the $30$ $\\gamma$-ray-detected sources in our sample. We find Pearson's\ncorrelation coefficient is $0.45$ ($p = 0.069$). This tentative correlation and\nthe flatness of the spectral index suggest that the beamed core emission\ncontributes to the low-frequency flux density. We compare our sample\ndistribution with that of the full LDR1 on colour-colour diagrams, and we use\nthis information to identify possible radio counterparts to two of the four UGS\nwithin the LDR1 field. We will refine our results as LoTSS continues.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Nov 2018 20:21:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

Ages have been derived for few of them showing differences up to few\nmillion years, hinting at being binary star clusters. However, final\nconfirmation needs to be done through spectroscopic analysis. Here we focus on\nthe LMC cluster pair NGC2006-SL538 and aim to determine whether the star\ncluster pair is a bound entity (binary star cluster) or a chance alignment.\nUsing the MIKE echelle spectrograph at LCO we have acquired integrated-light\nspectra for each cluster. We have measured radial velocities by two methods: a)\ndirect line profile measurement yields v$_r=300.3\\pm5\\pm6$ km/s for NGC2006 and\n$v_r=310.2\\pm4\\pm6$ km/s for SL538. b) By comparing observed spectra with\nsynthetic bootstrapped spectra yielding $v_r=311.0\\pm0.6$ km/s for NGC2006 and\n$v_r=309.4\\pm0.5$ km/s for SL538. Finally when spectra are directly compared,\nwe find a ${\\Delta}v=1.08\\pm0.47$ km/s. Full-spectrum SED fits reveal that the\nstellar population ages lie in the range 13-21 Myr with a metallicity of\nZ=0.008. We find indications for differences in the chemical abundance patterns\nas revealed by the helium absorption lines between the two clusters. The\ndynamical analysis shows that the two clusters are likely to merge within the\nnext $\\sim$150 Myr. The NGC2006-SL538 cluster pair shows radial velocities,\nstellar population and dynamical parameters consistent with a gravitational\nbound entity. We conclude that this is a genuine binary cluster pair, and we\npropose that their differences in ages and stellar population chemistry is most\nlikely due to variances in their chemical enrichment history within their\nenvironment. We suggest that their formation may have taken place in a loosely\nbound star-formation complex which saw initial fragmentation but then had its\nclusters become a gravitationally bound pair by tidal capture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Nov 2018 21:18:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-30"}

For a simplified model in which\nlong-lived neutral particles are pair produced and decay to two jets, pair\nproduction cross sections larger than 0.2 fb are excluded at 95% confidence\nlevel for a long-lived particle mass larger than 1000 GeV and proper decay\nlengths between 3 and 130 mm. Several supersymmetry models with gauge-mediated\nsupersymmetry breaking or $R$-parity violation, where pair-produced long-lived\ngluinos or top squarks decay to several final-state topologies containing\ndisplaced jets, are also tested. For these models, in the mass ranges above 200\nGeV, gluino masses up to 2300-2400 GeV and top squark masses up to 1350-1600\nGeV are excluded for proper decay lengths approximately between 10 and 100 mm.\nThese are the most restrictive limits to date on these models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Nov 2018 21:36:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 24 Feb 2019 14:27:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-27"}

There are several classes of CM sequences one of\nwhich is the reciprocal sequence. Reciprocal sequences have been widely used in\nmany areas including image processing, intelligent systems, and acausal\nsystems. To use them in application, we need not only their applicable dynamic\nmodels, but also some general approaches to designing parameters of dynamic\nmodels. Dynamic models governing two important classes of nonsingular Gaussian\n(NG) CM sequences (called $CM_L$ and $CM_F$ models), and a dynamic model\ngoverning the NG reciprocal sequence (called reciprocal $CM_L$ model) were\npresented in our previous work.

Font pairing is\nan important design task that is difficult for novices. Given a font selection\nfor one part of a document (e.g., header), our goal is to recommend a font to\nbe used in another part (e.g., body) such that the two fonts used together look\nvisually pleasing. There are three main challenges in font pairing. First, this\nis a fine-grained problem, in which the subtle distinctions between fonts may\nbe important. Second, rules and conventions of font pairing given by human\nexperts are difficult to formalize. Third, font pairing is an asymmetric\nproblem in that the roles played by header and body fonts are not\ninterchangeable. To address these challenges, we propose automatic font pairing\nthrough learning visual relationships from large-scale human-generated font\npairs. We introduce a new database for font pairing constructed from millions\nof PDF documents available on the Internet. We propose two font pairing\nalgorithms: dual-space k-NN and asymmetric similarity metric learning (ASML).\nThese two methods automatically learn fine-grained relationships from\nlarge-scale data.

Main sequence stars with a convective core are predicted to\nstochastically excite Internal Gravity Waves (IGWs), which effectively\ntransport angular momentum throughout the stellar interior and explain the\nobserved near-uniform interior rotation rates of intermediate-mass stars.\nHowever, there are few detections of IGWs, and fewer still made using\nphotometry, with more detections needed to constrain numerical simulations.\nAims. We aim to formalise the detection and characterisation of IGWs in\nphotometric observations of stars born with convective cores (M > 1.5\nM$_{\\odot}$) and parameterise the low-frequency power excess caused by IGWs.\nMethods. Using the most recent CoRoT light curves for a sample of O, B, A and F\nstars, we parameterise the morphology of the flux contribution of IGWs in\nFourier space using an MCMC numerical scheme within a Bayesian framework. We\ncompare this to predictions from IGW numerical simulations and investigate how\nthe observed morphology changes as a function of stellar parameters. Results.\nWe demonstrate that a common morphology for the low-frequency power excess is\nobserved in early-type stars observed by CoRoT. Our study shows that a\nbackground frequency-dependent source of astrophysical signal is common, which\nwe interpret as IGWs. We provide constraints on the amplitudes of IGWs and the\nshape of their detected frequency spectrum across a range of mass, which is the\nfirst ensemble study of stochastic variability in such a diverse sample of\nstars. Conclusions. The evidence of a low-frequency power excess across a wide\nmass range supports the interpretation of IGWs in photometry of O, B, A and F\nstars.

While these\ndevices provide a highly affordable support tool for the caregivers for\ncontinuous monitoring and to detect acute conditions, such as arrhythmia, their\nutility for cardiac diagnostics remains limited. This is because clinical\ndiagnosis of many cardiac pathologies is rooted in gleaning patterns from\nsynchronous 12-lead ECG. If synchronous 12-lead signals of clinical quality can\nbe synthesized from these single-lead devices, it can transform cardiac care by\nsubstantially reducing the costs and enhancing access to cardiac diagnostics.\nHowever, prior attempts to synthesize synchronous 12-lead ECG have not been\nsuccessful. Vectorcardiography (VCG) analysis suggests that cardiac axis\nsynthesized from earlier attempts deviates significantly from that estimated\nfrom 12-lead and/or Frank lead measurements. This work is perhaps the first\nsuccessful attempt to synthesize clinically equivalent synchronous 12-lead ECG\nfrom single-lead ECG. Our method employs a random forest machine learning model\nthat uses a subject's historical 12-lead recordings to estimate the morphology\nincluding the actual timing of various ECG events (relative to the measured\nsingle-lead ECG) for all 11 missing leads of the subject. Our method was\nvalidated on two benchmark datasets as well as paper ECG and AliveCor-Kardia\ndata obtained from the Heart, Artery, and Vein Center of Fresno, California.\nResults suggest that this approach can synthesize synchronous ECG with\naccuracies (R2) exceeding 90%.

To achieve better performance on these cognitive tasks,\nmerely recognizing individual object instances is insufficient. Instead, the\ninteractions between object instances need to be captured in order to\nfacilitate reasoning and understanding of the visual scenes in an image. Scene\ngraph, a graph representation of images that captures object instances and\ntheir relationships, offers a comprehensive understanding of an image. However,\nexisting techniques on scene graph generation fail to distinguish subjects and\nobjects in the visual scenes of images and thus do not perform well with\nreal-world datasets where exist ambiguous object instances. In this work, we\npropose a novel scene graph generation model for predicting object instances\nand its corresponding relationships in an image. Our model, SG-CRF, learns the\nsequential order of subject and object in a relationship triplet, and the\nsemantic compatibility of object instance nodes and relationship nodes in a\nscene graph efficiently. Experiments empirically show that SG-CRF outperforms\nthe state-of-the-art methods, on three different datasets, i.e., CLEVR, VRD,\nand Visual Genome, raising the Recall@100 from 24.99% to 49.95%, from 41.92% to\n50.47%, and from 54.69% to 54.77%, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2018 04:55:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-21"}

A global\nnetwork of GW detectors will play a key role to solve the unknown nature of the\nsources in coordinated observations with astronomical telescopes and detectors.\nHere we introduce KAGRA (former name LCGT; Large-scale Cryogenic Gravitational\nwave Telescope), a new GW detector with two 3-km baseline arms arranged in the\nshape of an \"L\", located inside the Mt. Ikenoyama, Kamioka, Gifu, Japan.\nKAGRA's design is similar to those of the second generations such as Advanced\nLIGO/Virgo, but it will be operating at the cryogenic temperature with sapphire\nmirrors. This low temperature feature is advantageous for improving the\nsensitivity around 100 Hz and is considered as an important feature for the\nthird generation GW detector concept (e.g. Einstein Telescope of Europe or\nCosmic Explorer of USA). Hence, KAGRA is often called as a 2.5 generation GW\ndetector based on laser interferometry. The installation and commissioning of\nKAGRA is underway and its cryogenic systems have been successfully tested in\nMay, 2018. KAGRA's first observation run is scheduled in late 2019, aiming to\njoin the third observation run (O3) of the advanced LIGO/Virgo network. In this\nwork, we describe a brief history of KAGRA and highlights of main feature. We\nalso discuss the prospects of GW observation with KAGRA in the era of O3. When\noperating along with the existing GW detectors, KAGRA will be helpful to locate\na GW source more accurately and to determine the source parameters with higher\nprecision, providing information for follow-up observations of a GW trigger\ncandidate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2018 05:14:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-16"}

However, there is no open-source hardware implementation of a\nheterogeneous-ISA processor available for research, and effective research on\nheterogeneous-ISA processors necessitates the emulation speed provided by FPGA\nprototyping. This work describes our experiences creating JuxtaPiton by\nintegrating a small RISC-V core into the OpenPiton framework, which uses a\nmodified OpenSPARC T1 core. This is the first time a new core has been\nintegrated with the OpenPiton framework, and JuxtaPiton is the first\nopen-source, general-purpose, heterogeneous-ISA processor. JuxtaPiton inherits\nall the capabilities of OpenPiton, including vital FPGA emulation\ninfrastructure which can boot full-stack Debian Linux.

Low-frequency (<1 GHz) observations of radio\nrecombination lines (RRLs) primarily from carbon and hydrogen offer a new, if\nnot unique, way to probe cold, largely atomic gas and warm, ionised gas in\nother galaxies. Furthermore, RRLs can be used to determine the physical state\nof the emitting regions, such as temperature and density. These properties make\nRRLs, potentially, a powerful tool of extragalactic ISM physics. At low radio\nfrequencies, its conceivable to detect RRLs out to cosmological distances when\nilluminated by a strong radio continuum. However, they are extremely faint (tau\n~ 1e-3 -- 1e-4) and have so far eluded detection outside of the local universe.\n  With LOFAR observations of the radio quasar 3C 190 (z=1.1946), we aim to\ndemonstrate that the ISM can be explored out to great distances through\nlow-frequency RRLs.\n  We report the detection of RRLs in the frequency range 112--163 MHz in the\nspectrum of 3C 190.

The same process occurs in lasers which limits its intrinsic\nlinewidth and makes the phase uncertainty difficult to calculate. The most\ncommonly used simplification is to assume a narrow photon-number distribution\nfor the optical field (which we call the small-noise approximation). For\ncoherent light, this condition is determined by the average photon number. The\nsmall-noise approximation relies on (i) the input to have a good\nsignal-to-noise ratio, and (ii) that such a signal-to-noise ratio can be\nmaintained throughout the amplification process. Here we ask: For a coherent\ninput, how many photons must be present in the input to a quantum linear\namplifier for the phase noise at the output to be amenable to a small-noise\nanalysis? We address these questions by showing how the phase uncertainty can\nbe obtained without recourse to the small-noise approximation. It is shown that\nfor an ideal linear amplifier (i.e. an amplifier most favourable to the\nsmall-noise approximation), the small-noise approximation breaks down with only\na few photons on average. Interestingly, when the input strength is increased\nto tens of photons, the small-noise approximation can be seen to perform much\nbetter and the process of phase diffusion permits a small-noise analysis. This\ndemarcates the limit of the small-noise assumption in linear amplifiers as such\nan assumption is less true for a nonideal amplifier.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2018 07:33:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Jan 2019 03:45:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 11 Oct 2019 05:00:31 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 25 Oct 2019 04:11:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-06"}

So, most of them\nuse a uniform threshold to scale in/out. In real NFV scenario, each VNF may\nserve the one or more flows, and the characteristics of these flows are\ncompletely different, a uniform threshold used in this scenario is not\nsuitable, because each VNF has a distinct processing logic depending on\nincident network traffic and events. Even if certain VNFs share packet\nprocessing functionality such as packet header analysis, the differences in\nupper-layer processing and implementation can exhibit unique resource usage\npatterns.\n  We proposes a dynamic threshold scaling mechanism that can tailor thresholds\naccording to each VNF's characteristic. As setting thresholds is a per-VNF\ntask, and requires a deep understanding of workload trends and the diversity of\neach VNF, so we have added tailor-made features to the traditional dynamic\nmechanism. Besides, we also reserve resources by predicting workload and add an\nemergency module to cope with anomaly traffic, that is to say we develop a\nhybrid scaling policy combining proactive and reactive scaling together.\nMoreover, the sharp rise of network traffic not only can be caused by large\namount of new incoming flows, but also can be induced by the growing of\nexisting flows. If the traffic arises mainly due to the growing of existing\nflows, then only rerouting new flows can not alleviate the overload quickly and\nSLAs may be violated \\cite{zhang2016co}. The only method to avoid SLA\nviolations is to migrate flows and associated NF internal states quickly and\nsafely from existing instances to new scaled instances, so state migration is\nan important part of the scaling procedure.

Recent studies have shown that deep neural networks tend to\nprioritize the learning of simple patterns over the memorization of noise\npatterns. This suggests a possible method to search for the best generalization\nthat learns the main pattern until the noise begins to be memorized.\nTraditional approaches often employ a clean validation set to find the best\nstop timing of learning, i.e., early stopping. However, the generalization\nperformance of such methods relies on the quality of validation sets. Further,\nin practice, a clean validation set is sometimes difficult to obtain. To solve\nthis problem, we propose a method that can estimate the optimal stopping timing\nwithout a clean validation set, called limited gradient descent.

In\nthis paper we propose a novel method that makes an explicit use of the\ndiscriminator in test-time, in a feedback manner in order to improve the\ngenerator results. To the best of our knowledge it is the first time a\ndiscriminator is involved in test-time. We claim that the discriminator holds\nsignificant information on the real data distribution, that could be useful for\ntest-time as well, a potential that has not been explored before.\n  The approach we propose does not alter the conventional training stage. At\ntest-time, however, it transfers the output from the generator into the\ndiscriminator, and uses feedback modules (convolutional blocks) to translate\nthe features of the discriminator layers into corrections to the features of\nthe generator layers, which are used eventually to get a better generator\nresult.

In this paper\nwe propose a weakly supervised method for automatic confidence estimation of\nacoustic shadow regions. Our method is able to generate a dense shadow-focused\nconfidence map. In our method, a shadow-seg module is built to learn general\nshadow features for shadow segmentation, based on global image-level\nannotations as well as a small number of coarse pixel-wise shadow annotations.\nA transfer function is introduced to extend the obtained binary shadow\nsegmentation to a reference confidence map. Additionally, a confidence\nestimation network is proposed to learn the mapping between input images and\nthe reference confidence maps. This network is able to predict shadow\nconfidence maps directly from input images during inference. We use evaluation\nmetrics such as DICE, inter-class correlation and etc. to verify the\neffectiveness of our method. Our method is more consistent than human\nannotation, and outperforms the state-of-the-art quantitatively in shadow\nsegmentation and qualitatively in confidence estimation of shadow regions. We\nfurther demonstrate the applicability of our method by integrating shadow\nconfidence maps into tasks such as ultrasound image classification, multi-view\nimage fusion and automated biometric measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2018 10:20:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Nov 2018 19:31:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 6 May 2019 17:03:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-07"}

To\nrecognize a sketched object, most existing methods discard such important\ntemporal ordering and grouping information from human and simply rasterize\nsketches into binary images for classification. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel single-branch attentive network architecture RNN-Rasterization-CNN\n(Sketch-R2CNN for short) to fully leverage the dynamics in sketches for\nrecognition. Sketch-R2CNN takes as input only a vector sketch with grouped\nsequences of points, and uses an RNN for stroke attention estimation in the\nvector space and a CNN for 2D feature extraction in the pixel space\nrespectively. To bridge the gap between these two spaces in neural networks, we\npropose a neural line rasterization module to convert the vector sketch along\nwith the attention estimated by RNN into a bitmap image, which is subsequently\nconsumed by CNN. The neural line rasterization module is designed in a\ndifferentiable way to yield a unified pipeline for end-to-end learning.

In Weyl semimetals, the foundational gapless topological\nphase, chiral degeneracies are isolated near the Fermi level and give rise to\nthe Fermi-arc surface states. However, it is now recognized that chiral\ndegeneracies are ubiquitous in the band structures of systems with broken\nspatial inversion ($\\mathcal{P}$) or time-reversal ($\\mathcal{T}$) symmetry.\nThis leads to a broadly defined notion of topological metals, which implies the\npresence of disconnected Fermi surface sheets characterized by non-zero Chern\nnumbers inherited from the enclosed chiral degeneracies. Here, we address the\npossibility of experimentally observing surface-related signatures of chiral\ndegeneracies in metals. As a representative system we choose bcc iron, a\nwell-studied archetypal ferromagnetic metal with two nontrivial electron\npockets. We find that the (110) surface presents arc-like resonances attached\nto the topologically nontrivial electron pockets. These Fermi-arc resonances\nare due to two different chiral degeneracies, a type-I elementary Weyl point\nand a type-II composite (Chern numbers $\\pm 2$) Weyl point, located at slightly\ndifferent energies close to the Fermi level. We further show that these surface\nresonances can be controlled by changing the orientation of magnetization,\neventually being eliminated following a topological phase transition. Our study\nthus shows that the intricate Fermi-arc features can be observed in materials\nas simple as ferromagnetic iron, and are possibly very common in polar and\nmagnetic materials broadly speaking.

These galaxies display large-scale remnant radio plasma in the\nintergalactic medium left behind by a past episode of active galactic nuclei\n(AGN) activity, and meanwhile, the radio jets have restarted in a new episode.\nThe knowledge of what causes the jets to switch off and restart is crucial to\nour understanding of galaxy evolution, while it is important to know if DDRGs\nform a host galaxy dichotomy relative to RLAGN. We utilised the LOFAR Two-Metre\nSky Survey DR1, using a visual identification method to compile a sample of\nmorphologically selected candidate DDRGs, showing two pairs of radio lobes. To\nconfirm the restarted nature in each of the candidate sources, we obtained\nfollow-up observations with the VLA at higher resolution to observe the inner\nlobes or restarted jets, the confirmation of which created a robust sample of\n33 DDRGs. We created a comparison sample of 777 RLAGN from the DR1 catalogue,\nand compared the optical and infrared magnitudes and colours of their host\ngalaxies. We find that there is no statistically significant difference in the\nbrightness of the host galaxies between double-doubles and single-cycle RLAGN.\nThe DDRG and RLAGN samples also have similar distributions in WISE mid-infrared\ncolours, indicating similar ages of stellar populations and dust levels in the\nhosts of DDRGs. We conclude that DDRGs and 'normal' RLAGN are hosted by\ngalaxies of the same type, and that DDRG activity is simply a normal part of\nthe life cycle of RLAGN.

Current state-of-the-art networks have enormous amount of\nparameters hence unsuitable for mobile devices, while other small memory\nfootprint models follow the spirit of classification network and ignore the\ninherent characteristic of semantic segmentation. To tackle this problem, we\npropose a novel Context Guided Network (CGNet), which is a light-weight and\nefficient network for semantic segmentation. We first propose the Context\nGuided (CG) block, which learns the joint feature of both local feature and\nsurrounding context, and further improves the joint feature with the global\ncontext. Based on the CG block, we develop CGNet which captures contextual\ninformation in all stages of the network and is specially tailored for\nincreasing segmentation accuracy. CGNet is also elaborately designed to reduce\nthe number of parameters and save memory footprint. Under an equivalent number\nof parameters, the proposed CGNet significantly outperforms existing\nsegmentation networks. Extensive experiments on Cityscapes and CamVid datasets\nverify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Specifically, without any\npost-processing and multi-scale testing, the proposed CGNet achieves 64.8% mean\nIoU on Cityscapes with less than 0.5 M parameters.

For a driven molecular\nsystem described in a bipartite Hilbert space H=Hel x Hvib of dimension 2 x Nv,\nwe derive the canonical form of the electronic master equation, deducing the\ncanonical measures of non-Markovianity and the Bloch volume of accessible\nstates.

Enhanced non-Markovian behavior, characterized\nby two negative decoherence rates, appears if there is a coupling between the\nelectronic states g, e, such that the evolution of the electronic populations\nobeys d(PgPe)/dt > 0. Non-Markovianity of the electronic evolution is analyzed\nin relation to temporal behaviors of the electronic-vibrational entanglement\nand electronic coherence, showing that enhanced non-Markovian behavior\naccompanies entanglement increase.

To address these challenges, we propose a\nsemi-supervised graph based dimensionality reduction method named\n`semi-supervised spatial spectral regularized manifold local scaling cut'\n(S3RMLSC). The underlying idea of the proposed method is to exploit the limited\nlabeled information from both the spectral and spatial domains along with the\nabundant unlabeled samples to facilitate the classification task by retaining\nthe original distribution of the data. In S3RMLSC, a hierarchical guided filter\n(HGF) is initially used to smoothen the pixels of the HSI data to preserve the\nspatial pixel consistency. This step is followed by the construction of linear\npatches from the nonlinear manifold by using the maximal linear patch (MLP)\ncriterion. Then the inter-patch and intra-patch dissimilarity matrices are\nconstructed in both spectral and spatial domains by regularized manifold local\nscaling cut (RMLSC) and neighboring pixel manifold local scaling cut (NPMLSC)\nrespectively. Finally, we obtain the projection matrix by optimizing the\nupdated semi-supervised spatial-spectral between-patch and total-patch\ndissimilarity.

However,\na fully tractable model system to teach us how this transition unfolds is still\nlacking. To bridge this gap, we quantify the effect of stochastic restart on\nthe first-passage time of a drift-diffusion process to an absorbing boundary.\nThere, we find that the transition is governed by the P\\'eclet number ($Pe$)\n--- the ratio between the rates of advective and diffusive transport. When\n$Pe>1$ the process is drift-controlled and restart can only hinder its\ncompletion. In contrast, when $0\\leq~Pe<1$ the process is diffusion-controlled\nand restart can speed-up its completion by a factor of $\\sim1/Pe$.

Asymmetric flow resistances arise in shallow nozzle/diffuser\nmicrochannels with deformable ceiling, in which the fluid flow is governed by a\nnon-linear coupled fluid-solid mechanics equation. Fluid flow rectification has\nbeen demonstrated for low-Reynolds-number flows (Re ~ O(0.001)-O(1)) of common\nNewtonian fluids such as air, water, and alcohol.

The\nlanguage of probabilities and statistics is often used to describe\ndisagreements quantitatively. In practice, however, we want much more than\nthat. We want disagreements to be resolved. This leaves us with a substantial\nknowledge gap which is often perceived as a lack of practical intuition\nregarding probabilistic and statistical concepts.\n  Take for instance the R\\'enyi divergence which is a well-known statistical\nquantity specifically designed as a measure of disagreement between\nprobabilistic models. Despite its widespread use in science and engineering,\nthe R\\'enyi divergence remains a highly abstract axiomatically-motivated\nmeasure. Certainly, it offers no practical insight as to how disagreements can\nbe resolved.\n  Here we propose to address disagreements using the methods of financial\neconomics. In particular, we show how a large class of disagreements can be\ntransformed into investment opportunities. The expected financial performance\nof such investments quantifies the amount of disagreement in a tangible way.\nThis provides intuition for statistical concepts such as the R\\'enyi divergence\nwhich becomes connected to the financial performance of optimized investments.\nInvestment optimization takes into account individual opinions as well as\nattitudes towards risk. The result is a market-like social mechanism by which\nfunds flow naturally to support a more accurate view. Such social mechanisms\ncan help us with difficult disagreements (e.g., financial arguments concerning\nthe future climate).\n  In terms of scientific validation, we used the findings of independent\nneurophysiological experiments as well as our own research on the equity\npremium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2018 15:15:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 8 Dec 2018 08:09:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 21 Jan 2019 14:13:45 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 19 Apr 2019 14:29:06 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 2019 13:28:47 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2020 11:02:25 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 09:30:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-01"}

Recent\nobservations show that 1 to 4 percent of single white dwarfs are accompanied by\ndusty disks, while the occurrence rate of metal pollution is about 25 to 50\npercent . The dusty disks and metal pollution have been associated with\naccretion of remnant planetary systems around white dwarfs, yet the relation\nbetween these two phenomena is still unclear. Here we suggest an evolutionary\nscenario to link the two observational phenomena. By analyzing a sample of\nmetal polluted white dwarfs, we find that the mass accretion rate onto the\nwhite dwarf generally follows a broken power law decay, which matches well with\nthe theoretical prediction, if assuming dust accretion is primarily driven by\nPoynting-Robertson drag and the dust source is primarily delivered via\ndynamically falling asteroids perturbed by a Jovian planet. The presence of\ndisks is mainly at the early stage (about 0.1 to 0.7 billion years) of the\nwhole process of metal pollution, which is detectable until about 8 billion\nyears, naturally explaining the fraction (about 2-16 percent) of metal-polluted\nwhite dwarfs having dusty disks. The success of this scenario also implies that\nthe configuration of an asteroid belt with an outer gas giant might be common\naround stars of several solar masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2018 15:35:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-21"}

One of the most widely known 2-Dimensional (2D) dielectric\nmaterials is hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). Solution-based techniques are\ncost-effective and allow simple methods to be used for device fabrication. In\nparticular, inkjet printing is a low-cost, non-contact approach, which also\nallows for device design flexibility, produces no material wastage and offers\ncompatibility with almost any surface of interest, including flexible\nsubstrates. In this work we use water-based and biocompatible graphene and hBN\ninks to fabricate all-2D material and inkjet-printed capacitors. We demonstrate\nan areal capacitance of 2.0 \\pm 0.3 nF cm^(-2) for a dielectric thickness of\n\\sim 3 \\mu m and negligible leakage currents, averaged across more than 100\ndevices. This gives rise to a derived dielectric constant of 6.1 \\pm 1.7. The\ninkjet printed hBN dielectric has a breakdown field of 1.9 \\pm 0.3 MV cm^(-1).\nFully printed capacitors with sub-/mu m hBN layer thicknesses have also been\ndemonstrated. The capacitors are then exploited in two fully printed\ndemonstrators: a resistor-capacitor (RC) low-pass filter and a graphene-based\nfield effect transistor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2018 14:34:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-17"}

This takes inspiration from a recently developed\nalgorithm [Liu \\emph{et al.}, J.~Chem.~Theor.~Comput.~ \\textbf{13}, 2571\n(2017)]. A key component is the accurate evaluation of electrostatic potential\nintegral, which is the rate-determining step. This introduces the Fourier\nconvolution theorem in conjunction with a range-separated Coulomb interaction\nkernel. The latter is efficiently mapped into real grid through a simple\noptimization procedure, giving rise to a constraint in the range-separated\nparameter. The overall process offers logarithmic scaling with respect to\nmolecular size. It is then extended towards global hybrid functionals such as\nB3LYP, PBE0 and BHLYP within pseudopotential Kohn-Sham theory, through an\nLCAO-MO ansatz in Cartesian grid, developed earlier in our laboratory. For sake\nof comparison, a parallel semi-numerical approach has also been worked out that\nexploits the familiar Obara-Saika recursion algorithm. An excellent agreement\nbetween these two routes is demonstrated through total energy and orbital\nenergy in a series of atoms and molecules (including 10 $\\pi$-electron\nmolecules), employing an LANL2DZ-type basis function. A critical analysis of\nthese two algorithms reveals that the proposed numerical scheme could lead to\nvery attractive and competitive scaling. The success of our approach also\nenables us for further development of optimally tuned range-separated hybrid\nand hyper functionals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2018 14:57:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-05"}

The feedback weights are also updated with a local rule, the same as\nthe feedforward weights - a weight is updated solely based on the product of\nactivity of the units it connects. With fixed feedback weights as proposed in\nLillicrap et. al (2016) performance degrades quickly as the depth of the\nnetwork increases. If the feedforward and feedback weights are initialized with\nthe same values, as proposed in Zipser and Rumelhart (1990), they remain the\nsame throughout training thus precisely implementing back-propagation. We show\nthat even when the weights are initialized differently and at random, and the\nalgorithm is no longer performing back-propagation, performance is comparable\non challenging datasets. We also propose a cost function whose derivative can\nbe represented as a local Hebbian update on the last layer. Convolutional\nlayers are updated with tied weights across space, which is not biologically\nplausible. We show that similar performance is achieved with untied layers,\nalso known as locally connected layers, corresponding to the connectivity\nimplied by the convolutional layers, but where weights are untied and updated\nseparately. In the linear case we show theoretically that the convergence of\nthe error to zero is accelerated by the update of the feedback weights.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Nov 2018 20:40:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Mar 2019 21:05:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-14"}
