In this paper, we\nexplore a third solution: to automatically improve existing test cases written\nby developers. We present the concept, design, and implementation of a system\ncalled \\dspot, that takes developer-written test cases as input (junit tests in\nJava) and synthesizes improved versions of them as output. Those test\nimprovements are given back to developers as patches or pull requests, that can\nbe directly integrated in the main branch of the test code base. We have\nevaluated DSpot in a deep, systematic manner over 40 real-world unit test\nclasses from 10 notable and open-source software projects. We have amplified\nall test methods from those 40 unit test classes. In 26/40 cases, DSpot is able\nto automatically improve the test under study, by triggering new behaviors and\nadding new valuable assertions. Next, for ten projects under consideration, we\nhave proposed a test improvement automatically synthesized by \\dspot to the\nlead developers. In total, 13/19 proposed test improvements were accepted by\nthe developers and merged into the main code base. This shows that DSpot is\ncapable of automatically improving unit-tests in real-world, large-scale Java\nsoftware.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2018 16:00:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-25"}

This paper develops a new, categorically oriented\nview based on a clear distinction between syntax (string diagrams) and\nsemantics (stochastic matrices), connected via interpretations as\nstructure-preserving functors. A key notion in the identification of causal\neffects is that of an intervention, whereby a variable is forcefully set to a\nparticular value independent of any prior propensities. We represent the effect\nof such an intervention as an endofunctor which performs `string diagram\nsurgery' within the syntactic category of string diagrams. This diagram surgery\nin turn yields a new, interventional distribution via the interpretation\nfunctor. While in general there is no way to compute interventional\ndistributions purely from observed data, we show that this is possible in\ncertain special cases using a calculational tool called comb disintegration. We\ndemonstrate the use of this technique on a well-known toy example, where we\npredict the causal effect of smoking on cancer in the presence of a confounding\ncommon cause.

In the limit of an infinitesimally small rotation\nof the acoustic black hole, the gyroscope still precesses with a finite\nfrequency, thus confirming a behaviour analogous to geodetic precession in a\nphysical non-rotating spacetime like a Schwarzschild black hole.

Forced oscillations and\nmechanical resonance were already described by Galileo early in the 17th\ncentury, even though he misunderstood them. The phenomenon was then completely\nignored by Newton but was partly rediscovered in the 18th century, as a purely\nmathematical surprise, by Euler. Not earlier than in the 19th century did\nThomas Young give the first correct description. Until then, forced\noscillations were not investigated for the purpose of understanding the motion\nof a pendulum, or of a mass on a spring, or the acoustic resonance, but in the\ncontext of the ocean tides. Thus, in the field of pure mechanics the results by\nYoung had no echo at all. On the other hand, in the 19th century mechanical\nresonance disasters were observed ever more frequently, e.g. with suspension\nbridges and steam engines, but were not recognized as such. The equations\ngoverning forced mechanical oscillations were then rediscovered in other fields\nlike acoustics and electrodynamics and were later found to play an important\nrole also in quantum mechanics. Only then, in the early 20th century, the\nimportance of the one-dimensional mechanical resonance as a fundamental model\nprocess was recognized in various fields, at last in engineering mechanics.\nThere may be various reasons for the enormous time span between the\nintroduction of this simple mechanical phenomenon into science and its due\nscientific appreciation.

In\nthis work, we explore a novel training procedure and an associated unsupervised\nmodel which creates graph representations optimised to predict the future state\nof the graph. We make use of graph convolutional neural networks to encode the\ngraph into a latent representation, which we then use to train our temporal\noffset reconstruction method, inspired by auto-encoders, to predict a later\ntime point -- multiple time steps into the future. Using our method, we\ndemonstrate superior performance for the task of future link prediction\ncompared with none-temporal state-of-the-art baselines. We show our approach to\nbe capable of outperforming non-temporal baselines by 38% on a real world\ndataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2018 17:01:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-21"}

Namely, we\npresent how $3$-dimensional surgery alters the fundamental group of the initial\nmanifold and present ways to calculate the fundamental group of the resulting\nmanifold. We also point out how the fundamental group can detect the\ntopological complexity of non-trivial embeddings that produce knotting. The\nsecond approach can only be applied for standard embeddings. For such cases, we\ngive new visualizations for both types of $3$-dimensional surgery as different\nrotations of the decompactified $2$-sphere. Each rotation produces a different\ndecomposition of the $3$-sphere which corresponds to a different visualization\nof the $4$-dimensional process of $3$-dimensional surgery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2018 17:40:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-21"}

Several methods for the estimation of the Fried\nparameter and outer scale have been developed, most of which are based on the\nfitting of Zernike polynomial coefficients variances reconstructed from the\ntelemetry.

It is found that cross\ncoupling is the dominant bias. An iterative algorithm to overcome it is\npresented. Simulations are conducted for typical ranges of the outer scale (4\nto 32m), Fried parameter (10 cm) and noise in the variances (signal-to-noise\nratio of 10 and above).

We\nconsider here the case of generic deformations associated to a parameter $q$\nwhich is not a root of unity. The Separation of Variables (SoV) basis for the\ntransfer matrix spectral problem is generated by using the action of the\ntransfer matrix itself on a generic co-vector of the Hilbert space, following\nthe general procedure described in our paper [1]. Such a SoV construction\nallows to prove that for general values of the parameters defining the model\nthe transfer matrix is diagonalizable and with simple spectrum for any twist\nmatrix which is also diagonalizable with simple spectrum. Then, using together\nthe knowledge of such a SoV basis and of the fusion relations satisfied by the\nhierarchy of transfer matrices, we derive a complete characterization of the\ntransfer matrix eigenvalues and eigenvectors as solutions of a system of\npolynomial equations of order $n+1$. Moreover, we show that such a SoV discrete\nspectrum characterization is equivalently reformulated in terms of a finite\ndifference functional equation, the quantum spectral curve equation, under a\nproper choice of the set of its solutions. A construction of the associated\nQ-operator induced by our SoV approach is also presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2018 18:23:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-18"}

Depending on their morphology and size, we\ndistinguish between giant radio haloes, which occur predominantly in merging\nclusters, and mini haloes, which are found in non-merging, cool-core clusters.\nLow-frequency sensitive observations are required to assess whether the\nemission discovered in these few cases is common in galaxy clusters or not.\nWith this aim, we carried out a campaign of observations with the LOw Frequency\nARay (LOFAR) in the frequency range 120 - 168 MHz of nine massive clusters\nselected from the \\textit{Planck} SZ catalogue, which had no sign of major\nmergers. In this paper, we discuss the results of the observations that have\nled to the largest cluster sample studied within the LOFAR Two-metre Sky\nSurvey, and we present Chandra X-ray data used to investigate the dynamical\nstate of the clusters, verifying that the clusters are currently not undergoing\nmajor mergers, and to search for traces of minor or off-axis mergers.

We conclude that radio emission in non-merging massive clusters is not\ncommon at the sensitivity level reached by our observations and that no clear\nconnection with the cluster dynamical state is observed.

To do this, we use the fact that a PDF fit may be recast\nin a physical basis, where the PDFs themselves are bypassed entirely, and one\ninstead relates measured observables to predicted ones.

Despite the recent discovery of spiral-shaped features in\nprotoplanetary discs in the near-infrared and millimetric wavelengths, there is\nstill an active discussion to understand how they formed. In fact, the spiral\nwaves observed in discs around young stars can be due to different physical\nmechanisms: planet/companion torques, gravitational perturbations or\nillumination effects. Aims. We study the spirals formed in the gaseous phase\ndue to two diametrically opposed shadows cast at fixed disc locations. The\nshadows are created by an inclined non-precessing disc inside the cavity, which\nis assumed to be optically thick. In particular, we analyse the effect of these\nspirals on the dynamics of the dust particles and discuss their detectability\nin transition discs. Methods. We perform gaseous hydrodynamical simulations\nwith shadows, then we compute the dust evolution on top of the gaseous\ndistribution, and finally we produce synthetic ALMA observations of the dust\nemission based on radiative transfer calculations. Results. Our main finding is\nthat mm- to cm-sized dust particles are efficiently trapped inside the\nshadow-triggered spirals.

This dynamical effect would favour grain growth and affect the\nresulting composition of planetesimals in the disc. In addition, our radiative\ntransfer calculations show spiral patterns in the disc at 1.6 {\\mu}m and 1.3\nmm. Due to their faint thermal emission (compared to the bright inner regions\nof the disc) the spirals cannot be detected with ALMA. Our synthetic\nobservations prove however that shadows are observable as dips in the thermal\nemission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2018 19:00:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-30"}

First, we investigate fgas for 75 AGN host galaxies in the extended\nGALEX Arecibo SDSS Survey (xGASS), whose atomic gas fractions are complete to a\nfew percent.

Herein, a collection of robust characterization methods are\npresented, implemented within the Automatic Flow Framework for Materials\nDiscovery (AFLOW), that leverages materials data for the prediction of phase\ndiagrams and properties of disordered materials. These methods directly address\nthe issue of materials synthesizability, bridging the gap between simulation\nand experiment.

As calculated with standardized parameter sets, the wealth\nof data also presents a favorable learning environment. Machine learning\nalgorithms are employed for property prediction, descriptor development, design\nrule discovery, and the identification of candidate functional materials. When\ncombined with physical models and intelligently formulated descriptors, the\ndata becomes a powerful tool, facilitating the discovery of new materials for\napplications ranging from high-temperature superconductors to thermoelectrics.\nThese methods have been validated by the synthesis of two new permanent magnets\nintroduced herein - the first discovered by computational approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2018 19:51:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-23"}

However, flaws in the FCS\nmethod, due to its high sensitivity to the environment, have recently been\nevaluated, calling the prior diffusion results into question. It behooves us to\nadopt complimentary and direct methods to measure the mobility of enzymes in\nsolution. Herein, we use a novel technique of direct single-molecule imaging to\nobserve the diffusion of single enzymes. This technique is less sensitive to\nintensity fluctuations and gives the diffusion coefficient directly based on\nthe trajectory of the enzymes. Our measurements recapitulate that enzyme\ndiffusion is enhanced in the presence of its substrate and find that the\nrelative increase in diffusion of a single enzyme is even higher than those\npreviously reported using FCS. We also use this complementary method to test if\nthe total enzyme concentration affects the relative increase in diffusion and\nif enzyme oligomerization state changes during catalytic turnover.

The most prevalent\nparadigm for the design and employment of multi-core fibers relies on the\nsuppression of direct coupling of optical power among cores. The cores,\nhowever, remain mechanically coupled. Inter-core, opto-mechanical cross-talk,\namong cores that are otherwise optically isolated from one another, is shown in\nthis work for the first time. Light in one core stimulates guided acoustic\nmodes of the entire fiber cladding. These modes, in turn, induce refractive\nindex perturbations that extend across to other cores. Unlike corresponding\nprocesses in standard fiber, light waves in off-axis cores stimulate general\ntorsional-radial guided acoustic modes of the cylindrical cross-section.\nHundreds of such modes give rise to inter-core cross-phase modulation, with\nbroad spectra that are quasi-continuous up to 1 GHz frequency. Inter-core\ncross-talk in a commercial, seven-core fiber is studied in both analysis and\nexperiment. Opto-mechanical cross-talk is quantified in terms of an equivalent\nnonlinear coefficient, per acoustic mode or per frequency. The nonlinear\ncoefficient may reach 1.9 [W*km]-1, a value which is comparable with that of\nthe intra-core Kerr effect in the same fiber.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2018 21:24:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-22"}

Modern cell models often involve hundreds of parameters; the values\nof these parameters come, more often than not, from animal experiments whose\nrelationship to the human physiology is weak with very little information on\nthe errors in these measurements. The concomitant uncertainties in parameter\nvalues result in uncertainties in the model outputs or Quantities of Interest\n(QoIs). Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) aims at apportioning to individual\nparameters (or sets of parameters) their relative contribution to output\nuncertainty thereby introducing a measure of influence or importance of said\nparameters. New GSA approaches are required to deal with increased model size\nand complexity; a three stage methodology consisting of screening (dimension\nreduction), surrogate modeling, and computing Sobol' indices, is presented. The\nmethodology is used to analyze a physiologically validated numerical model of\nneurovascular coupling which possess 160 uncertain parameters. The sensitivity\nanalysis investigates three quantities of interest (QoIs), the average value of\n$K^+$ in the extracellular space, the average volumetric flow rate through the\nperfusing vessel, and the minimum value of the actin/myosin complex in the\nsmooth muscle cell. GSA provides a measure of the influence of each parameter,\nfor each of the three QoIs, giving insight into areas of possible physiological\ndysfunction and areas of further investigation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2018 21:44:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-22"}

These out-of-equilibrium species diffuse into the regolith, so\nsubsurface microbes could use them as a source of energy and carbon. Indeed, CO\noxidation and methanogenesis are relatively simple and evolutionarily ancient\nmetabolisms on Earth. Consequently, assuming CO- or H2- consuming metabolisms\nwould evolve on Mars, the persistence of CO and H2 in the martian atmosphere\nset limits on subsurface metabolic activity. Here, we constrain such maximum\nsubsurface metabolic activity on Mars using a 1-D photochemical model with a\nhypothetical global biological sink on atmospheric CO and H2. We increase the\nbiological sink until the model atmospheric composition diverges from observed\nabundances. We find maximum biological downward subsurface sinks of 1.5e8\nmolecules/cm^2/s for CO and 1.9e8 molecules/cm^2/s for H2. These covert to a\nmaximum metabolizing biomass of <10^27 cells or <2e11 kg, equivalent to <1e-4\nto 1e-5 of Earth's biomass, depending on the terrestrial estimate. Diffusion\ncalculations suggest this upper biomass limit applies to the top few kilometers\nof the martian crust in communication with the atmosphere at low to mid\nlatitudes. This biomass limit is more robust than previous estimates because we\ntest multiple possible chemoautotrophic ecosystems over a broad parameter space\nof tunable model variables using an updated photochemical model with precise\natmospheric concentrations and uncertainties from Curiosity. Our results of\nsparse or absent life in the martian subsurface also demonstrate how the\natmospheric redox pairs of CO-O2 and H2-O2 may constitute antibiosignatures,\nwhich may be relevant to excluding life on exoplanets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2018 21:55:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-09"}

One emerging application\nfor N-UNCD is as a photoelectrode material for high-precision optical neural\nstimulation. This may be used for the treatment of neurological disorders and\nfor implantable bionic devices such as cochlear ear implants and retinal\nprostheses. N-UNCD is a well-suited material for stimulation photoelectrodes,\nexhibiting a photocurrent response to light at visible wavelengths with a high\ncharge injection density [A. Ahnood, A. N.

In this study, the photoresponse of\nN-UNCD to near-infrared (NIR) irradiation is measured. NIR light has greater\noptical penetration through tissue than visible wavelengths, opening the\npossibility to stimulate previously inaccessible target cells. It is found that\nN-UNCD exhibits a photoresponsivity which diminishes rapidly with increasing\nwavelength and is attributed to transitions between mid-gap states and the\nconduction band tail associated with the graphitic phase present at the grain\nboundaries. Oxygen surface termination on the diamond films provides further\nenhancement of the injected charge per photon, compared to as-grown or hydrogen\nterminated surfaces. Based on the measured injected charge density, we estimate\nthat the generated photocurrent of oxygen terminated N-UNCD is sufficient to\nachieve extracellular stimulation of brain tissue within the safe optical\nexposure limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2018 22:32:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-22"}

In many\nmodern enhancement systems, large amounts of data are used to train a deep\nnetwork to estimate masks for complex-valued short-time Fourier transforms\n(STFTs) to suppress noise and preserve speech. However, current masking\napproaches often neglect two important constraints: STFT consistency and\nmixture consistency. Without STFT consistency, the system's output is not\nnecessarily the STFT of a time-domain signal, and without mixture consistency,\nthe sum of the estimated sources does not necessarily equal the input mixture.\nFurthermore, the only previous approaches that apply mixture consistency use\nreal-valued masks; mixture consistency has been ignored for complex-valued\nmasks. In this paper, we show that STFT consistency and mixture consistency can\nbe jointly imposed by adding simple differentiable projection layers to the\nenhancement network. These layers are compatible with real or complex-valued\nmasks. Using both of these constraints with complex-valued masks provides a 0.7\ndB increase in scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio (SI-SDR) on a large\ndataset of speech corrupted by a wide variety of nonstationary noise across a\nrange of input SNRs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2018 22:44:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-22"}

We use the Precision Time Protocol (PTP), the\nmost widely used protocol for high-precision clock synchronization, to\ndemonstrate that statistical traffic analysis can identify properties that\nsupport selective message delay attacks even for encrypted traffic. We\nfurthermore identify a fundamental conflict in secure clock synchronization\nbetween the need of deterministic traffic to improve precision and the need to\nobfuscate traffic in order to mitigate delay attacks.\n  A theoretical analysis of clock synchronization protocols isolates the\ncharacteristics that make these protocols vulnerable to delay attacks and\nargues that such attacks cannot be prevented entirely but only be mitigated.\nKnowledge of the underlying communication network in terms of one-way delays\nand knowledge on physical constraints of these networks can help to compute\nguaranteed maximum bounds for slave clock offsets. These bounds are essential\nfor detecting delay attacks and minimizing their impact. In the general case,\nhowever, the precision that can be guaranteed in adversarial settings is orders\nof magnitude lower than required for high-precision clock synchronization in\ncritical infrastructures, which, therefore, must not rely on a precise notion\nof time when using untrusted networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Nov 2018 02:29:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-22"}

The first solution works well for linear neural architectures,\nbut latest networks such as ResNet and Inception offer limited opportunity for\nthis overlapping. Therefore, researchers have paid more attention to minimizing\ncommunication.

Although the detection probability of planets\nsuggests that the planet population in open clusters resembles that in the\nfield, only a few dozen planet-hosting stars have been discovered in open\nclusters. We explore the survival rates of planets against stellar encounters\nin open clusters similar to the Pleiades, Hyades, and Praesepe and embedded\nclusters. We performed a series of N-body simulations of high-density and\nlow-density open clusters, open clusters that grow via mergers of subclusters,\nand embedded clusters. We semi-analytically calculated the survival rate of\nplanets in star clusters up to 1Gyr using relative velocities, masses, and\nimpact parameters of intruding stars. Less than 1.5% of close-in planets within\n1 AU and at most 7% of planets with 1-10 AU are ejected by stellar encounters\nin clustered environments after the dynamical evolution of star clusters. If a\nplanet population from 0.01-100 AU in an open cluster initially follows the\nprobability distribution function of exoplanets with semi-major axis ($a_p$)\nbetween 0.03-3 AU in the field discovered by RV surveys, the PDF of surviving\nplanets beyond ~10 AU in open clusters can be slightly modified to $\\propto\na_p^{-0.76}$. The production rate of free-floating planets (FFPs) per star is\n0.0096-0.18, where we have assumed that all the stars initially have one giant\nplanet with a mass of 1--13 MJ in a circular orbit. The expected frequency of\nFFPs is compatible with the upper limit on that of FFPs indicated by recent\nmicrolensing surveys. Our survival rates of planets in open clusters suggest\nthat planets within 10 AU around FGKM-type stars are rich in relatively-young\n(<~10-100 Myr for open clusters and ~1-10 Myr for embedded clusters), less\nmassive open clusters, which are promising targets for planet searches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Nov 2018 05:02:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Apr 2019 05:18:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-24"}

Unfortunately, for many problems this can result in\nsevere time-step restrictions. The techniques used to develop explicit\npositivity preserving DG discretizations can, however, not easily be combined\nwith implicit time integration methods. In this paper we therefore present a\nnew approach. Using Lagrange multipliers the conditions imposed by the\npositivity preserving limiters are directly coupled to a DG discretization\ncombined with a Diagonally Implicit Runge-Kutta time integration method. The\npositivity preserving DG discretization is then reformulated as a\nKarush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) problem, which is frequently encountered in\nconstrained optimization. Since the limiter is only active in areas where\npositivity must be enforced it does not affect the higher order DG\ndiscretization elsewhere. The resulting non-smooth nonlinear algebraic\nequations have, however, a different structure compared to most constrained\noptimization problems. We therefore develop an efficient active set semi-smooth\nNewton method that is suitable for the KKT formulation of time-implicit\npositivity preserving DG discretizations. Convergence of this semi-smooth\nNewton method is proven using a specially designed quasi-directional derivative\nof the time-implicit positivity preserving DG discretization. The time-implicit\npositivity preserving DG discretization is demonstrated for several nonlinear\nscalar conservation laws, which include the advection, Burgers, Allen-Cahn,\nBarenblatt, and Buckley-Leverett equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Nov 2018 07:57:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Dec 2018 06:20:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 31 Mar 2019 22:56:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-03"}

Most existing 3D shape retrieval\nmethods focus on capturing strong discriminative shape representation with\nsoftmax loss for the classification task, while the shape feature learning with\nmetric loss is neglected for 3D shape retrieval. In this paper, we address this\nproblem based on the intuition that the cosine distance of shape embeddings\nshould be close enough within the same class and far away across categories.\nSince most of 3D shape retrieval tasks use cosine distance of shape features\nfor measuring shape similarity, we propose a novel metric loss named angular\ntriplet-center loss, which directly optimizes the cosine distances between the\nfeatures. It inherits the triplet-center loss property to achieve larger\ninter-class distance and smaller intra-class distance simultaneously. Unlike\nprevious metric loss utilized in 3D shape retrieval methods, where Euclidean\ndistance is adopted and the margin design is difficult, the proposed method is\nmore convenient to train feature embeddings and more suitable for 3D shape\nretrieval. Moreover, the angle margin is adopted to replace the cosine margin\nin order to provide more explicit discriminative constraints on an embedding\nspace.

In this work, we adopt an algorithm-hardware co-design approach\nto develop a ConvNet accelerator called Synetgy and a novel ConvNet model\ncalled DiracDeltaNet$^{\\dagger}$.

Tidal flows, and the\nexcitation, propagation, and dissipation of tidally-induced inertial waves can\nbe modified by stellar magnetic fields (e.g., Wei 2016, 2018, Lin and Ogilvie\n2018). It is thus important to assess for which stars, at which location of\ntheir internal structure, and at which phase of their evolution, one needs to\ntake into account the effects of magnetic fields on tidal waves. Using scaling\nlaws that provide the amplitude of dynamo-generated magnetic fields along the\nrotational evolution of these stars (e.g., Christensen et al. 2009, Brun et al.\n2015), combined with detailed grids of stellar rotation models (e.g., Amard et\nal. 2016), we examine the influence of a magnetic field on tidal forcing and\ndissipation near the tachocline of solar-like stars.

In previous studies, the X-ray bolometric luminosity used in\nthe radio/X-ray correlation has been estimated using a narrow, soft X-ray band.\nWe study how estimating the X-ray bolometric luminosity using broadband\nobservations of X-ray binaries affects the radio/X-ray correlation. We found\nthat the ratio between the broadband (3-200 keV) and narrowband (3-9 keV)\nluminosities varies between 5-10 in the hard X-ray state. Overall, the\nresulting radio/X-ray correlation slopes and normalizations did not present a\nvery significant change suggesting that they are not affected greatly by\nobservational biases but are caused by real physical effects. We found that all\nsources that reach high enough luminosity change their correlation slopes from\nthe universal slope to a much steeper one. In addition, sources in the steeper\nradio/X-ray track show a distinct cutoff in the high energy X-ray spectrum at\ntens of keV. These results suggest that the accretion flow presents a\nmorphological change at a certain critical luminosity during the outburst rise\nfrom radiatively inefficient to radiatively efficient flow that is in turn more\nefficient in cooling the hot accretion flow producing the hard X-ray emission.\nThis change could also affect to the jet launching properties in these systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Nov 2018 09:50:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-30"}

Yet, the interplay between network topology\nand locality of the response to such damage is poorly understood. Here, we\nstudy how topology affects the redistribution of flow after the failure of a\nsingle link in linear flow networks with a special focus on power grids. In\nparticular, we analyze the decay of flow changes with distance after a link\nfailure and map it to the field of an electrical dipole for lattice-like\nnetworks. The corresponding inverse-square law is shown to hold for all regular\ntilings. For sparse networks, a long-range response is found instead. In the\ncase of more realistic topologies, we introduce a rerouting distance, which\ncaptures the decay of flow changes better than the traditional geodesic\ndistance. Finally, we are able to derive rigorous bounds on the strength of the\ndecay for arbitrary topologies that we verify through extensive numerical\nsimulations. Our results show that it is possible to forecast flow rerouting\nafter link failures to a large extent based on purely topological measures and\nthat these effects generally decay with distance from the failing link. They\nmight be used to predict links prone to failure in supply networks such as\npower grids and thus help to construct grids providing a more robust and\nreliable power supply.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Nov 2018 11:00:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-22"}

This\nDoppler shift to shorter wavelength is commonly known as convective blueshift.\nWe performed systematic observations of the quiet Sun with the Laser Absolute\nReference Spectrograph (LARS) at the German Vacuum Tower Telescope. The solar\ndisk was scanned along the meridian and the equator, from the disk center\ntoward the limb. The solar spectrum around 6173{\\AA} was calibrated with a\nlaser frequency comb on an absolute wavelength scale with an accuracy of a few\nm/s. We applied a bisector analysis on the spectral lines to reveal the changes\nof convective blueshift and line asymmetry at different heliocentric positions.\nBeing a signature for convective motions, the bisector curve of Fe i\n6173.3{\\AA} describes a C-shape at disk center. When approaching the solar\nlimb, the bisector transforms into a \\-shape. The analysis of the time- and\nbisector-averaged line shifts yields three distinct results. Firstly, the\ncenter-to-limb variation of Doppler velocities measured with LARS reveals a\nsignificant discrepancy (up to 200m/s) to the full-disk Dopplergrams of the\nHelioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI). Secondly, we obtained a significant\ndecrease of convective blueshift toward the solar limb. Thirdly, the\nline-of-sight effect of solar activity leads to a scatter of up to 100m/s at\nintermediate heliocentric positions. The accurate observation of the absolute\nconvective blueshift with LARS allows the identification of systematic\ndiscrepancy with Doppler velocities measured by HMI. The center-to-limb\nvariation of HMI suffers from an additional blueshift toward the limb that is\nincompatible with our results.

However, these classifiers perform poorly\nwith wordlist-based DGA families, which generate domains by pseudorandomly\nconcatenating dictionary words. We propose a novel approach that combines\ncontext-sensitive word embeddings with a simple fully-connected classifier to\nperform classification of domains based on word-level information.

The resulting small number of trainable parameters\nenabled extremely short training durations, while the transfer of language\nknowledge stored in the representations allowed for high-performing models with\nsmall training datasets. We show that this architecture reliably outperformed\nexisting techniques on wordlist-based DGA families with just 30 DGA training\nexamples and achieved state-of-the-art performance with around 100 DGA training\nexamples, all while requiring an order of magnitude less time to train compared\nto current techniques. Of special note is the technique's performance on the\nmatsnu DGA: the classifier attained a 89.5% detection rate with a 1:1,000 false\npositive rate (FPR) after training on only 30 examples of the DGA domains, and\na 91.2% detection rate with a 1:10,000 FPR after 90 examples.

It, however, seemingly\ncontradicts the evolutionary theory, since cooperators are exploited by\nfree-riders and thus are disfavored by natural selection. Many studies based on\nevolutionary game theory have tried to solve the puzzle and figure out the\nreason why cooperation exists and how it emerges. Network reciprocity is one of\nthe mechanisms to promote cooperation, where nodes refer to individuals and\nlinks refer to social relationships. The spatial arrangement of mutant\nindividuals, which refers to the clustering of mutants, plays a key role in\nnetwork reciprocity. Besides, many other mechanisms supporting cooperation\nsuggest that the clustering of mutants plays an important role in the expansion\nof mutants. However, the clustering of mutants and the game dynamics are\ntypically coupled. It is still unclear how the clustering of mutants alone\nalters the evolutionary dynamics. To this end, we employ a minimal model with\nfrequency independent fitness on a circle. It disentangles the clustering of\nmutants from game dynamics. The distance between two mutants on the circle is\nadopted as a natural indicator for the clustering of mutants or assortment. We\nfind that the assortment is an amplifier of the selection for the connected\nmutants compared with the separated ones. Nevertheless, as mutants are\nseparated, the more dispersed mutants are, the greater the chance of invasion\nis. It gives rise to the non-monotonic effect of clustering, which is\ncounterintuitive. On the other hand, we find that less assortative mutants\nspeed up fixation. Our model shows that the clustering of mutants plays a\nnon-trivial role in fixation, which has emerged even if the game interaction is\nabsent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Nov 2018 13:32:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Aug 2019 02:17:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-23"}

Analogues results for the\nNevanlinna class are also considered, by taking advantage of Nevanlinna\ninterpolating sequences.\n  It is shown that, instead of considering solutions with prescribed zeros, it\nis possible to construct a bounded solution of $f''+Af=0$ in such a way that it\nsolves an interpolation problem natural to bounded analytic functions, while\n$|A(z)|^2(1-|z|^2)^3\\, dm(z)$ remains to be a Carleson measure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Nov 2018 14:00:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-22"}

The typical way of\nconducting transfer learning with deep neural networks is to fine-tune a model\npre-trained on the source task using data from the target task. In this paper,\nwe propose an adaptive fine-tuning approach, called SpotTune, which finds the\noptimal fine-tuning strategy per instance for the target data. In SpotTune,\ngiven an image from the target task, a policy network is used to make routing\ndecisions on whether to pass the image through the fine-tuned layers or the\npre-trained layers. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed approach. Our method outperforms the traditional\nfine-tuning approach on 12 out of 14 standard datasets.We also compare SpotTune\nwith other state-of-the-art fine-tuning strategies, showing superior\nperformance.

The proposed\nformulation in this work supports joint scheduling of energy and reserve to\npromote an economic and reliable operation. To improve its scalability, a\ntwo-stage iterative optimization algorithm is proposed based on Bender's\ndecomposition framework. Therewith, the optimal schedule is computed subject to\nthe feasibility of AC network constraints (AC-NCs) at predetermined uncertain\nrealizations. A convex relaxation is applied to AC-NCs to support the\nconvergence of the algorithm. Moreover, the integration of RESs is often\nlimited by transmission congestion issues in existing grids. For such grids, AC\nto DC conversion schemes can be viable and attractive options for capacity\nexpansion. In this study, we adopt a hybrid AC/DC transmission grid (HTG)\narchitecture with a specific topology to improve the effective utilization of\nthe grid capacity and accommodate more demand and RESs, which is showcased via\nsimulations on a large-scale network. Moreover, HTG induces exactness of the\nconvex relaxation of AC-NCs, supporting the validity of the optimal schedule.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Nov 2018 14:34:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-22"}

Complex Answer Retrieval (CAR) is the\nretrieval of answers to such questions. In their simplest form, these questions\nare constructed from a topic entity (e.g., `cheese') and a facet (e.g., `health\neffects'). While topic matching has been thoroughly explored, we observe that\nsome facets use general language that is unlikely to appear verbatim in\nanswers. We call these low-utility facets. In this work, we present an approach\nto CAR that identifies and addresses low-utility facets. We propose two\nestimators of facet utility. These include exploiting the hierarchical\nstructure of CAR queries and using facet frequency information from training\ndata. To improve the retrieval performance on low-utility headings, we also\ninclude entity similarity scores using knowledge graph embeddings. We apply our\napproaches to a leading neural ranking technique, and evaluate using the TREC\nCAR dataset. We find that our approach perform significantly better than the\nunmodified neural ranker and other leading CAR techniques. We also provide a\ndetailed analysis of our results, and verify that low-utility facets are indeed\nmore difficult to match, and that our approach improves the performance for\nthese difficult queries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Nov 2018 15:09:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-22"}

Missing samples can be compensated for by applying\nconventional missing data restoration methods; however, ensuring that restored\nsamples roughly follow underlying distributions of true missing data remains a\nchallenge. Another strategy involves directly restoring the probability density\nfunction (PDF) for a sensor when samples are missing by leveraging distribution\ninformation from another sensor with complete data using distribution\nregression techniques; existing methods include the conventional\ndistribution-to-distribution regression (DDR) and distribution-to-warping\nfunction regression (DWR) methods. Due to constraints on PDFs and warping\nfunctions, the regression functions of both methods are estimated from the\nNadaraya-Watson kernel estimator with relatively low degrees of precision. This\narticle proposes a new indirect distribution-to-distribution regression method\nin the context of functional data analysis for restoring distributions of\nmissing SHM data. PDFs are transformed to ordinary functions residing in a\nHilbert space via the newly proposed log-quantile-density (LQD) transformation;\nthe regression for distributions is realized in the transformed space via a\nfunctional regression model constructed based on the theory of Reproducing\nKernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), corresponding result is subsequently mapped back\nto the density space through the inverse LQD transformation. Test results using\nfield monitoring data indicate that the new method significantly outperforms\nconventional methods in general cases; however, in extrapolation cases, the new\nmethod is inferior to the distribution-to-warping function regression method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Nov 2018 15:44:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 8 Dec 2018 08:52:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-11"}

However, from data it is only possible to measure the\nexpression of genes while it is impossible to directly measure the activity of\npathways. Nevertheless, the knowledge on the inter-dependence between the\ngroups and the variables allows for a multi-layer network inference, on both\nobserved variables and groups, even if no direct information on the latter is\npresent in the data (hence groups are considered as latent). In this paper, we\npropose an extension of the latent graphical lasso method that leverages on the\nknowledge of the inter-links between the hidden (groups) and observed layers.\nThe method exploits the knowledge of group structure that influence the\nbehaviour of observed variables to retrieve a two layers network. Its efficacy\nwas tested on synthetic data to check its ability in retrieving the network\nstructure compared to the ground truth. We present a case study on\nNeuroblastoma, which shows how our multi-level inference is relevant in real\ncontexts to infer biologically meaningful connections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Nov 2018 10:39:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-28"}

Passive stereo is a simple solution for\ncapturing dynamic scenes at underwater environment, however the shape with\ntextureless surfaces or irregular reflections cannot be recovered.

For\nconductivity, a representative volume element was obtained for most of the\nrange of capillary suction, but there is a small range of capillary suction for\nwhich the coefficient of variation does not reduce with increasing size of the\ncomputational cell, due to onset and termination of percolation of the wetting\nfluid (during wetting and drying, respectively).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2018 23:02:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-29"}
