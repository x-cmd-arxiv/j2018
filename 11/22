Existing multi-method studies focus on proposing a\nsingle quality estimator. On the contrary, we investigate the generalizability\nof multi-method fusion as a framework. In addition to support vector machines\nthat are commonly used in the multi-method fusion, we propose using neural\nnetworks in the boosting. To span different types of image quality assessment\nalgorithms, we use quality estimators based on fidelity, perceptually-extended\nfidelity, structural similarity, spectral similarity, color, and learning. In\nthe experiments, we perform k-fold cross validation using the LIVE, the\nmultiply distorted LIVE, and the TID 2013 databases and the performance of\nimage quality assessment algorithms are measured via accuracy-, linearity-, and\nranking-based metrics. Based on the experiments, we show that boosting methods\ngenerally improve the performance of image quality assessment and the level of\nimprovement depends on the type of the boosting algorithm. Our experimental\nresults also indicate that boosting the worst performing quality estimator with\ntwo or more additional methods leads to statistically significant performance\nenhancements independent of the boosting technique and neural network-based\nboosting outperforms support vector machine-based boosting when two or more\nmethods are fused.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Nov 2018 17:16:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-22"}

However, the\ndetails of what controls the period of these oscillations is poorly understood,\ndespite being crucial in assessing whether OR can account for observed periodic\nbehaviour. This paper aims to highlight that different types of reconnection\nreversal are supported about null points, and that these are distinct from the\noscillation on the closed-boundary, linear systems considered in the 1990s. In\nparticular, we explore the features of a nonlinear oscillation local to the\nnull point, and examine the effect of resistivity and perturbation energy on\nthe period, contrasting it to the linear case. It is found that in the linear\nsystems, the inverse Lundquist number dictates the period, provided the\nperturbation energy is small relative to the inverse Lundquist number defined\non the boundary, regardless of the broadband structure of the initial\nperturbation. However, when the perturbation energy exceeds the threshold\nrequired for 'nonlinear' null collapse to occur, a complex oscillation of the\nmagnetic field is produced which is, at best, only weakly-dependent on the\nresistivity. The resultant periodicity is strongly influenced by the amount of\nfree energy, with more energetic perturbations producing higher-frequency\noscillations. Crucially, with regards to typical solar-based and\nastrophysical-based input energies, we demonstrate that the majority far exceed\nthe threshold for nonlinearity to develop. This substantially alters the\nproperties and periodicity of both null collapse and subsequent OR. Therefore,\nnonlinear regimes of OR should be considered in solar and astrophysical\ncontexts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Nov 2018 17:15:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-16"}

We critically assess the current\nSmoothed Particle Magneto-Hydrodynamics (SPMHD) schemes, especially\nhighlighting the impact of a hyperbolic divergence cleaning scheme and\nartificial resistivity switch on the magnetic field evolution in cosmological\nsimulations of the formation of a galaxy cluster using the N-body/SPMHD code\ngcmhd++.

We demonstrate that the hyperbolic\ndivergence cleaning scheme is effective at suppressing the growth of the\nnumerical divergence error of the magnetic field and should be applied to any\nSPMHD simulation. Although the artificial resistivity is important in the\nstrong field regime, it can suppress the growth of the magnetic field in the\nweak field regime, such as galaxy clusters. With sufficient resolution,\nsimulations with divergence cleaning can reproduce observed magnetic fields.

In the\nlatter non-renormalizable scenario, the dominant creation of DM particles\ntypically occurs at the largest SM temperature attained during the radiation\nera (assuming a standard cosmological history), and for this reason it is\nreferred to as ultraviolet freeze-in.

Therefore,\nviscous HMNS disk winds cannot reproduce by themselves the ejecta properties\ninferred from multi-component fits to kilonova light curves from GW170817.\nThree possible resolutions remain feasible within standard merger ejecta\nchannels: more sophisticated radiative transfer models that allow for photon\nreprocessing between ejecta components, inclusion of magnetic stresses, or\nenhancement of the dynamical ejecta. We provide fits to our disk outflow models\nonce they reach homologous expansion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Nov 2018 19:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-12"}

The atmospheric absorption of the Earth is an important limiting\nfactor for ground-based spectroscopic observations and the near-infrared and\ninfrared regions are the most affected. Several software packages that produce\na synthetic atmospheric transmission spectrum have been developed to correct\nfor the telluric absorption; these are Molecfit, TelFit, and TAPAS. Aims. Our\ngoal is to compare the correction achieved using these three telluric\ncorrection packages and the division by a telluric standard star. We want to\nevaluate the best method to correct near-infrared high-resolution spectra as\nwell as the limitations of each software package and methodology. Methods. We\napplied the telluric correction methods to CRIRES archival data taken in the J\nand K bands. We explored how the achieved correction level varies depending on\nthe atmospheric T-P profile used in the modelling, the depth of the atmospheric\nlines, and the molecules creating the absorption. Results. We found that the\nMolecfit and TelFit corrections lead to smaller residuals for the water lines.\nThe standard star method corrects best the oxygen lines. The Molecfit package\nand the standard star method corrections result in global offsets always below\n0.5% for all lines; the offset is similar with TelFit and TAPAS for the H2O\nlines and around 1% for the O2 lines. All methods and software packages result\nin a scatter between 3% and 7% inside the telluric lines. The use of a tailored\natmospheric profile for the observatory leads to a scatter two times smaller,\nand the correction level improves with lower values of precipitable water\nvapour. Conclusions.

In this paper our goal is to verify this assumption\nby analysing the two-dimensional large-scale distribution of dust in galaxies\nfrom the DustPedia sample. For this purpose, we make use of Herschel imaging in\nfive bands, from 100 to 500{\\mu}m, in which the cold dust constituent is\nprimarily traced and makes up the bulk of the dust mass in spiral galaxies. For\na subsample of 320 disc galaxies, we successfully perform a simultaneous\nfitting with a single S\\'ersic model of the Herschel images in all five bands\nusing the multiband modelling code GALFITM. We report that the S\\'ersic index\n$n$, which characterises the shape of the S\\'ersic profile, lies systematically\nbelow 1 in all Herschel bands and is almost constant with wavelength. The\naverage value at 250{\\mu}m is $0.67\\pm0.37$ (187 galaxies are fitted with\n$n_{250}\\leq0.75$, 87 galaxies have $0.75<n_{250}\\leq1.25$, and 46 - with\n$n_{250}>1.25$). Most observed profiles exhibit a depletion in the inner region\n(at $r<0.3-0.4$ of the optical radius $r_{25}$ ) and are more or less\nexponential in the outer part. We also find breaks in the dust emission\nprofiles at longer distances $(0.5-0.6)r_{25}$ which are associated with the\nbreaks in the optical and near-infrared. We assume that the observed deficit of\ndust emission in the inner galaxy region is related to the depression in the\nradial profile of the HI surface density in the same region because the atomic\ngas reaches high enough surface densities there to be transformed into\nmolecular gas. If a galaxy has a triggered star formation in the inner region\n(for example, because of a strong bar instability, which transfers the gas\ninwards to the centre, or a pseudobulge formation), no depletion or even an\nexcess of dust emission in the centre is observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Nov 2018 19:39:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-13"}

Do observables such as energy and\nposition have meaningful values only at the precise moment of measurement, as\nin the Copenhagen interpretation? Or is position always definite and guided by\nthe wave function, as in de Broglie-Bohm pilot wave theory? In the language of\nBell, what are the \"beables\" of quantum theory and what values may they take in\nspace and time? This is the quantum reality problem. A definitive answer\nrequires not just describing which physical quantities exist in a quantum\nsystem, but describing what configurations of those quantities in space and\ntime are allowed, and with what probability those configurations occur. Adrian\nKent sets out a new vision of quantum theory along these lines. His\ninterpretation supplements quantum theory to infer the value of physical\nquantities in spacetime from the asymptotic late-time behavior of the quantum\nsystem. In doing so, a Lorentz-covariant and single-world solution to the\nquantum reality problem is achieved. In this paper, the framework of Kent's\ninterpretation is presented from the ground up. After a broad overview, a\nderivation of the generalized Aharonov-Bergmann-Lebowitz (ABL) rule is provided\nbefore applying Kent's interpretation to toy model systems, in both\nrelativistic and non-relativistic settings. By adding figures and discussion, a\nbroad introduction is provided to Kent's proposed interpretation of quantum\ntheory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Nov 2018 21:03:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-26"}

A rich body\nof work has focused on detecting photo tampering and manipulation by verifying\nthe integrity of image content. Instead, we aim to detect photo misuse by\nverifying the capture time and location of photos. This paper is motivated by\nthe law of nature that sun position varies with the time and location, which\ncan be used to determine whether the claimed contextual information corresponds\nwith the sun position that the image content actually indicates. Prior\napproaches to inferring sun position from images mainly rely on vanishing\npoints associated with at least two shadows, while we propose novel algorithms\nwhich utilize only one shadow in the image to infer the sun position.\nMeanwhile, we compute the sun position by applying astronomical algorithms\nwhich take as input the claimed capture time and location. Only when the two\nestimated sun positions are consistent can the claimed contextual information\nbe genuine. We have developed a prototype called IMAGEGUARD. The experimental\nresults show that our method can successfully estimate sun position and detect\nthe time-location inconsistency with high accuracy. By setting the thresholds\nto be 9.4 degrees and 5 degrees for the sun position distance and the altitude\nangle distance, respectively, our system can correctly identify 91.5% of\nfalsified photos with fake contextual information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Nov 2018 21:08:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-26"}

One such\nchallenge concerns establishing adequate boundaries and finding a proper data\nsource. Typical IDS detection approaches deal with raw traffics. These traffics\nneed to be studied in depth and thoroughly investigated in order to extract the\nrequired knowledge base. Another challenge involves implementing the binary\ndecision. This is because there are no reasonable limits between normal and\nattack traffics patterns. In this paper, we introduce a novel idea capable of\nsupporting the proper data source while avoiding the issues associated with the\nbinary decision. This paper aims to introduce a detection approach for defining\nabnormality by using the Fuzzy Rule Interpolation (FRI) with Simple Network\nManagement Protocol (SNMP) Management Information Base (MIB) parameters. The\nstrength of the proposed detection approach is based on adapting the SNMP-MIB\nparameters with the FRI. This proposed method eliminates the raw traffic\nprocessing component which is time consuming and requires extensive\ncomputational measures. It also eliminates the need for a complete fuzzy rule\nbased intrusion definition. The proposed approach was tested and evaluated\nusing an open source SNMP-MIB dataset and obtained a 93% detection rate.\nAdditionally, when compared to other literature in which the same test-bed\nenvironment was employed along with the same number of parameters, the proposed\ndetection approach outperformed the support vector machine and neural network.\nTherefore, combining the SNMP-MIB parameters with the FRI based reasoning could\nbe beneficial for detecting intrusions, even in the case if the fuzzy rule\nbased intrusion definition is incomplete (not fully defined).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Nov 2018 21:17:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-26"}

However, a task-motion plan can be sensitive to unexpected\ndomain uncertainty and changes, leading to suboptimal behaviors or execution\nfailures. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, TMP-RL, which is an\nintegration of TMP and reinforcement learning (RL) from the execution\nexperience, to solve the problem of robust task-motion planning in dynamic and\nuncertain domains. TMP-RL features two nested planning-learning loops. In the\ninner TMP loop, the robot generates a low-cost, feasible task-motion plan by\niteratively planning in the discrete space and updating relevant action costs\nevaluated by the motion planner in continuous space. In the outer loop, the\nplan is executed, and the robot learns from the execution experience via\nmodel-free RL, to further improve its task-motion plans. RL in the outer loop\nis more accurate to the current domain but also more expensive, and using less\ncostly task and motion planning leads to a jump-start for learning in the real\nworld. Our approach is evaluated on a mobile service robot conducting\nnavigation tasks in an office area. Results show that TMP-RL approach\nsignificantly improves adaptability and robustness (in comparison to TMP\nmethods) and leads to rapid convergence (in comparison to task planning (TP)-RL\nmethods). We also show that TMP-RL can reuse learned values to smoothly adapt\nto new scenarios during long-term deployments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Nov 2018 21:20:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-26"}

To mimic similar behaviour, zero-shot object\ndetection aims to recognize and localize 'unseen' object instances by using\nonly their semantic information. The model is first trained to learn the\nrelationships between visual and semantic domains for seen objects, later\ntransferring the acquired knowledge to totally unseen objects. This setting\ngives rise to the need for correct alignment between visual and semantic\nconcepts, so that the unseen objects can be identified using only their\nsemantic attributes. In this paper, we propose a novel loss function called\n'Polarity loss', that promotes correct visual-semantic alignment for an\nimproved zero-shot object detection. On one hand, it refines the noisy semantic\nembeddings via metric learning on a 'Semantic vocabulary' of related concepts\nto establish a better synergy between visual and semantic domains. On the other\nhand, it explicitly maximizes the gap between positive and negative predictions\nto achieve better discrimination between seen, unseen and background objects.\nOur approach is inspired by embodiment theories in cognitive science, that\nclaim human semantic understanding to be grounded in past experiences (seen\nobjects), related linguistic concepts (word vocabulary) and visual perception\n(seen/unseen object images). We conduct extensive evaluations on MS-COCO and\nPascal VOC datasets, showing significant improvements over state of the art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Nov 2018 01:01:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2019 05:24:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2020 05:53:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-03"}

Above the quantum supremacy threshold (approx. 60\nqubits), NISQ machines are expected to be more powerful than existing classical\ncomputers. One of the most stringent problems is that computations (expressed\nas quantum circuits) have to be adapted (compiled) to the NISQ hardware,\nbecause the hardware does not support arbitrary interactions between the\nqubits. This procedure introduces additional gates (e.g. SWAP gates) into the\ncircuits while leaving the implemented computations unchanged. Each additional\ngate increases the failure rate of the adapted (compiled) circuits, because the\nhardware and the circuits are not fault-tolerant. It is reasonable to expect\nthat the placement influences the number of additionally introduced gates.\nTherefore, a combinatorial problem arises: how are circuit qubits allocated\n(placed) initially to the hardware qubits?

How such large\nflares occurred and why they are confined are still not well understood. Here\nwe studied a confined X2.2 flare in NOAA 12673 on 2017 September 6. It exhibits\ntwo episodes of flare brightening with rather complex, atypical ribbons. Based\non topology analysis of extrapolated coronal magnetic field, we revealed that\nthere is a two-step magnetic reconnection process during the flare. Prior to\nthe flare, there is a magnetic flux rope (MFR) with one leg rooted in a\nrotating sunspot. Neighboring to the leg is a magnetic null-point structure.\nThe sunspot drives the MFR to expand, pushing magnetic flux to the null point,\nand reconnection is first triggered there. The disturbance from the null-point\nreconnection triggers the second reconnection, i.e., a tether-cutting\nreconnection below the rope. However, these two reconnections failed to produce\nan eruption, because the rope is firmly held by its strapping flux.\nFurthermore, we compared this flare with an eruptive X9.3 flare in the same\nregion with 2 hours later, which has a similar MFR configuration. The key\ndifference between them is that, for the confined flare, the MFR is fully below\nthe threshold of torus instability, while for the eruptive one, the MFR reaches\nentirely above the threshold. This study provides a good evidence supporting\nthat reconnection alone may not be able to trigger eruption, rather, MHD\ninstability plays a more important role.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Nov 2018 03:36:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

A litmus test for the strength of adversarial examples is\ntheir transferability across different DNN models in a black box setting (i.e.\nwhen the target model's architecture and parameters are not known to attacker).\nCurrent attack algorithms that seek to enhance adversarial transferability work\non the decision level i.e. generate perturbations that alter the network\ndecisions. This leads to two key limitations: (a) An attack is dependent on the\ntask-specific loss function (e.g. softmax cross-entropy for object recognition)\nand therefore does not generalize beyond its original task. (b) The adversarial\nexamples are specific to the network architecture and demonstrate poor\ntransferability to other network architectures. We propose a novel approach to\ncreate adversarial examples that can broadly fool different networks on\nmultiple tasks. Our approach is based on the following intuition: \"Perpetual\nmetrics based on neural network features are highly generalizable and show\nexcellent performance in measuring and stabilizing input distortions. Therefore\nan ideal attack that creates maximum distortions in the network feature space\nshould realize highly transferable examples\". We report extensive experiments\nto show how adversarial examples generalize across multiple networks for\nclassification, object detection and segmentation tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Nov 2018 04:35:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Mar 2019 07:54:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 26 Mar 2019 06:09:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

On\ntop of the classical steps of iterative relaxation approaches, we iteratively\nrefine/split involved matroid constraints to obtain a more restrictive\nconstraint system, that is amenable to iterative relaxation techniques. Hence,\nthroughout the iterations, we both tighten constraints and later relax them by\ndropping constrains under certain conditions. Due to the refinement step, we\ncan deal with considerably more general constraint classes than existing\niterative relaxation/rounding methods, which typically round on one matroid\npolytope with additional simple cardinality constraints that do not overlap too\nmuch.\n  We show how our rounding method, combined with an application of a matroid\nintersection algorithm, yields the first $2$-approximation for finding a\nmaximum-weight common independent set in $3$ matroids. Moreover, our\n$2$-approximation is LP-based, and settles the integrality gap for the natural\nrelaxation of the problem.

Following this analysis, we propose super\ndiffusion, a novel inclusive learning-based framework for salient object\ndetection, which makes the optimum and robust performance by integrating a\nlarge pool of feature spaces, scales and even features originally computed for\nnon-diffusion-based salient object detection. A closed-form solution of the\noptimal parameters for the integration is determined through supervised\nlearning. At the local level, we propose to promote each individual diffusion\nbefore the integration. Our mathematical analysis reveals the close\nrelationship between saliency diffusion and spectral clustering.

State of the art attacks can overcome most of the\ndefense or detection mechanisms suggested so far, and adversaries have the\nupper hand in this arms race. Adversarial examples are designed to resemble the\nnormal input from which they were constructed, while triggering an incorrect\nclassification. This basic design goal leads to a characteristic spatial\nbehavior within the context of Activation Spaces, a term coined by the authors\nto refer to the hyperspaces formed by the activation values of the network's\nlayers. Within the output of the first layers of the network, an adversarial\nexample is likely to resemble normal instances of the source class, while in\nthe final layers such examples will diverge towards the adversary's target\nclass. The steps below enable us to leverage this inherent shift from one class\nto another in order to form a novel adversarial example detector. We construct\nEuclidian spaces out of the activation values of each of the deep neural\nnetwork layers. Then, we induce a set of k-nearest neighbor classifiers (k-NN),\none per activation space of each neural network layer, using the\nnon-adversarial examples. We leverage those classifiers to produce a sequence\nof class labels for each nonperturbed input sample and estimate the a priori\nprobability for a class label change between one activation space and another.\nDuring the detection phase we compute a sequence of classification labels for\neach input using the trained classifiers. We then estimate the likelihood of\nthose classification sequences and show that adversarial sequences are far less\nlikely than normal ones.

In this paper, we explore some applications of random projections in\ndeep neural networks. We provide the expressive power of fully connected neural\nnetworks when the input data are sparse vectors or form a low-dimensional\nsmooth manifold. We prove that the number of neurons required for approximating\na Lipschitz function with a prescribed precision depends on the sparsity or the\ndimension of the manifold and weakly on the dimension of the input vector. The\nkey in our proof is that random projections embed stably the set of sparse\nvectors or a low-dimensional smooth manifold into a low-dimensional subspace.\nBased on this fact, we also propose some new neural network models, where at\neach layer the input is first projected onto a low-dimensional subspace by a\nrandom projection and then the standard linear connection and non-linear\nactivation are applied. In this way, the number of parameters in neural\nnetworks is significantly reduced, and therefore the training of neural\nnetworks can be accelerated without too much performance loss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Nov 2018 07:52:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2019 10:35:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-11"}

The\ndeveloped model resulted in perfect qualitative agreement with all experimental\ndata obtained earlier for Fe-based elastomers. The proposed model is useful to\nstudy these novel functional materials, analyze the features of\nmagnetodielectric effect and predict the optimal composition of\nmagnetorheological elastomers for further profound experimental study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Nov 2018 09:47:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-25"}

Here we report an observation of the THE in ultrathin (unit cells.\nu.c.) 4d ferromagnetic SrRuO3 films grown on SrTiO3(001) substrates, which can\nbe attributed to the chiral ordering of spin structure (i.e., skyrmion-like) in\nthe single SrRuO3 layer without contacting 5d oxide SrIrO3 layer. It is\nrevealed that the RuO6 octahedral tilting induced by local\northorhombic-to-tetragonal structural phase transition exists across the\nSrRuO3/SrTiO3 interface, which naturally breaks the inversion symmetry. Our\ntheoretical calculations demonstrate that the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM)\ninteraction arises owing to the broken inversion symmetry and strong spin-orbit\ninteraction of 4d SrRuO3. This DM interaction can stabilize the N\\'eel-type\nmagnetic skyrmions, which in turn accounts for the observed THE in transport.\nThe RuO6 octahedral tilting-induced DM interaction provides a pathway toward\nthe electrical control of the topological spin textures and resultant THE,\nwhich is confirmed both experimentally and theoretically.

In\nparticular, the abundances of deuterated species are very sensitive to the\nphysical conditions in the environment where they form. Due to the low\ntemperatures in regions of star formation, these isotopologues are enhanced to\nsignificant levels, making detections of multiply-deuterated species possible.\nHowever, for complex organic species, only the multiply-deuterated variants of\nmethanol and methyl cyanide have been reported so far. The aim of this paper is\nto initiate the characterisation of multiply-deuterated variants of complex\norganic species with the first detection of doubly-deuterated methyl formate,\nCHD2OCHO. We use ALMA observations from the Protostellar Interferometric Line\nSurvey (PILS) of the protostellar binary IRAS 16293-2422, in the spectral range\nof 329.1 GHz to 362.9 GHz. We report the first detection of doubly-deuterated\nmethyl formate CHD2OCHO in the ISM. The D/H ratio of CHD2OCHO is found to be\n2-3 times higher than the D/H ratio of CH2DOCHO for both sources, similar to\nthe results for formaldehyde from the same dataset. The observations are\ncompared to a gas-grain chemical network coupled to a dynamical physical model,\ntracing the evolution of a molecular cloud until the end of the Class 0\nprotostellar stage. The overall D/H ratio enhancements found in the\nobservations are of the same order of magnitude as the predictions from the\nmodel for the early stages of Class 0 protostars. However, the higher D/H ratio\nof CHD2OCHO compared to the D/H ratio of CH2DOCHO is still not predicted by the\nmodel. This suggests that a mechanism is enhancing the D/H ratio of singly- and\ndoubly-deuterated methyl formate that is not in the model, e.g. mechanisms for\nH-D substitutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Nov 2018 10:50:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-13"}

Pressure ulcers appear following excessive\ncompression of buttock's soft tissues by bony structures, and particularly in\nischial and sacral bones. Current prevention techniques are mainly based on\ndaily skin inspection to spot red patches or injuries. Nevertheless, most\npressure ulcers occur internally and are difficult to detect early. Estimating\ninternal strains within soft tissues could help to evaluate the risk of\npressure ulcer. A subject-specific biomechanical model could be used to assess\ninternal strains from measured skin surface pressures. However, a realistic 3D\nnon-linear Finite Element buttock model, with different layers of tissue\nmaterials for skin, fat and muscles, requires somewhere between minutes and\nhours to compute, therefore forbidding its use in a real-time daily prevention\ncontext. In this article, we propose to optimize these computations by using a\nreduced order modeling technique (ROM) based on proper orthogonal\ndecompositions of the pressure and strain fields coupled with a machine\nlearning method. ROM allows strains to be evaluated inside the model\ninteractively (i.e. in less than a second) for any pressure field measured\nbelow the buttocks. In our case, with only 19 modes of variation of pressure\npatterns, an error divergence of one percent is observed compared to the full\nscale simulation for evaluating the strain field. This reduced model could\ntherefore be the first step towards interactive pressure ulcer prevention in a\ndaily setup.

During the exam, the women breast is compressed\nbetween two plates until a nearly uniform breast thickness is obtained. This\ntechnique improves image quality and reduces dose but can also be the source of\ndiscomfort and sometimes pain for the patient. Therefore, alternative\ntechniques allowing reduced breast compression is of potential interest. The\naim of this work is to develop a 3D biomechanical Finite Element (FE) breast\nmodel in order to analyze various breast compression strategies and their\nimpact on image quality and radiation dose. Large breast deformations are\nsimulated using this FE model with ANSYS software. A particular attention is\ngranted to the computation of the residual stress in the model due to gravity\nand boundary conditions (thorax anatomy, position of the patient inside the MRI\nmachine). Previously developed biomechanical breast models use a simplified\nbreast anatomy by modeling adipose and fibroglandular tissues only (Rajagopal\net al. in Wiley Interdiscip Rev: Syst Biol Med 2:293--304, 2010). However,\nbreast reconstruction surgery has proven the importance of suspensory ligaments\nand breast fasciae on breast mechanics (Lockwood in Plast Reconstr Surg\n103:1411--1420, 1999). We are therefore consider using a more realistic breast\nanatomy by including skin, muscles, and suspensory ligaments. The breast\ntissues are modeled as neo-Hookean materials. A physical correct modeling of\nthe breast requires the knowledge of the stress-free breast configuration.\nHere, this undeformed shape (i.e., without any residual stress) is computed\nusing the prediction--correction iterative scheme proposed by Eiben et al. (Ann\nof Biomed Eng 44:154--173, 2016). The unloading procedure uses the breast\nconfiguration in prone and supine position in order to find a unique\ndisplacement vector field induced by gravitational forces. The 3D breast\ngeometry is reconstructed from MRI images that are segmented (Yushkevich et al.\nin Neuroimage 31:1116--1128, 2006) to differentiate the four main tissue types.\nThe breast volume is discretized with a hexa-dominant FE meshing tool as a\nunique volume. Finally, the model is evaluated by comparing the estimated\nbreast deformations under gravity load with the experimental ones measured in\nthree body positions: prone, supine, and oblique supine.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Nov 2018 11:00:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-26"}

The simplest way to\nstabilize such interfaces is by fabricating droplets of liquid crystal in\nwater; however, a greater sensitivity to interfacial effects can be achieved\nusing liquid crystal shells, i.e. spherical films of liquid crystal suspended\nin water. Anchoring transitions on those systems are traditionally triggered by\nthe adsorption of surfactant molecules onto the interface, which is neither an\ninstantaneous nor a reversible process. In this study, we report the ability to\nchange the anchoring of 4-cyano-4'-pentylbiphenyl (5CB), one of the most widely\nused liquid crystals, at the interface with dilute water solutions of polyvinyl\nalcohol (PVA), a polymer commonly used for stabilizing liquid crystal shells,\nsimply by controlling the temperature in the close vicinity of the liquid\ncrystal clearing point. A quasi-static increase in temperature triggers an\ninstantaneous reorientation of the molecules from parallel to perpendicular to\nthe interfaces, owing to the local disordering effect of PVA on 5CB, prior to\nthe phase transition of the bulk 5CB. We study this anchoring transition on\nboth flat suspended films and spherical shells of liquid crystals.

For example in a bipartite graph\nrepresenting user-website visiting activities, user cardinalities (the number\nof distinct visited websites) are monitored to report network anomalies. These\nreal-world graph streams may contain user-item duplicates and have a huge\nnumber of distinct user-item pairs, therefore, it is infeasible to exactly\ncompute user cardinalities when memory and computation resources are\nlimited.Existing methods are designed to approximately estimate user\ncardinalities, whose accuracy highly depends on parameters that are not easy to\nset. Moreover, these methods cannot provide anytime-available estimation, as\nthe user cardinalities are computed at the end of the data stream. Real-time\napplications such as anomaly detection require that user cardinalities are\nestimated on the fly. To address these problems, we develop novel bit and\nregister sharing algorithms, which use a bit array and a register array to\nbuild a compact sketch of all users' connected items respectively. Compared\nwith previous bit and register sharing methods, our algorithms exploit the\ndynamic properties of the bit and register arrays (e.g., the fraction of zero\nbits in the bit array at each time) to significantly improve the estimation\naccuracy, and have low time complexity (O(1)) to update the estimations each\ntime they observe a new user-item pair. In addition, our algorithms are simple\nand easy to use, without requirements to tune any parameter. We evaluate the\nperformance of our methods on real-world datasets.

This is quite different from the\nclassical $q$-ary MDS codes where it is conjectured that the code length is\nupper bounded by $q+1$ (or $q+2$ for some special case). This discovery\ninspired some recent studies on length of an optimal locally recoverable code.\nIt was shown in \\cite{LXY} that a $q$-ary optimal locally recoverable code is\nunbounded for $d=3,4$. Soon after, it was proved that a $q$-ary optimal locally\nrecoverable code with distance $d$ and locality $r$ can have length\n$\\Omega_{d,r}(q^{1 + 1/\\lfloor(d-3)/2\\rfloor})$. Recently, an explicit\nconstruction of $q$-ary optimal locally recoverable codes for distance $d=5,6$\nwas given in \\cite{J18} and \\cite{BCGLP}.\n  In this paper, we further investigate construction optimal locally\nrecoverable codes along the line of using parity-check matrices. Inspired by\nclassical Reed-Solomon codes and \\cite{J18}, we equip parity-check matrices\nwith the Vandermond structure. It is turns out that a parity-check matrix with\nthe Vandermond structure produces an optimal locally recoverable code must obey\ncertain disjoint property for subsets of $\\mathbb{F}_q$.

Through the literature about the solutions for energy control\nof buildings during operational phase, a 3-layers model is proposed to\nintegrate these solutions: first level consists in communication technologies,\nsecond level is about data modelling and third level is related to\ndecision-making tools. For each level, key research topics and remaining\nproblems are identified in order to achieve a concrete step forward. 1. CONTEXT\nAND PROBLEMATICS Through studies on ICT solutions for energy control of\nbuildings, a 3-layers model is proposed to integrate these solutions and\nposition a new way for energy efficiency. The building sector is the largest\nuser of energy and CO 2 emitter in the EU, estimated at approximately 40% of\nthe total consumption (Sharples et al., 1999). According to the International\nPanel on Climate Change (European Union, 2010), 30% of energy used in buildings\ncould be reduced with net economic benefits by 2030. Such a reduction, however,\nis meaningless unless \"sustainability\" is considered. Because of these factors,\nhealthy, sustainable, and energy efficient buildings have become active topics\nin international research; there is an urgent need for a new kind of\nhigh-technology driven and integrative research that should lead to the massive\ndevelopment of smart buildings and, in the medium term, smart cities. From a\nbuilding lifecycle perspective, most of the energy (~80%) is consumed during\nthe operational stage of the building (European Union, 2010) (Bilsen et al.,\n2013). Reducing building energy consumption may be addressed by the physical\nmodifications which can be operated on a building like upgrading windows,\nheating systems or modifying thermic characteristics by insulating. Another\npossible path to reduce the energy consumption of a building is to use\nInformation and Communication Technologies (ICT). According to the\nInternational Panel on Climate Change, a reduction of energy even greater than\nthe 30% can be targeted by 2030 by considering ICT solutions. In support of\nthis claim, some specialists believe that ICT-based solutions have the\npotential to enable 50-80% greenhouse gas reduction globally. In this respect,\nICT innovation opens prospects for the development of a new range of new\nservices highly available, flexible, safe, easy to integrate, and user friendly\n(Bilsen et al., 2013). This, in turn, should foster a sophisticated, reliable\nand fast communication infrastructure for the connection of various distributed\nelements (sensors, generators, substations...) that enables to exchange\nreal-time data, information and knowledge needed to improve efficiency (e.g.,\nto monitor and control energy consumption), reliability (e.g., to facilitate\nmaintenance operations), flexibility (e.g., to integrate new rules to meet new\nconsumer expectations), and investment returns, but also to induce a shift in\nconsumer behaviour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Nov 2018 13:07:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-26"}

Whereas the Devetak-Winter protocol attains a rate-sum\nequal to the von Neumann entropy of the joint source, here we show that the\nfull rate region is much more complex, due to the partially quantum nature of\nthe source. In particular, in the opposite case of compressing the quantum part\nof the source, using the classical part as side information at the decoder,\ntypically the rate sum is strictly larger than the von Neumann entropy of the\ntotal source.\n  We determine the full rate region in the generic case, showing that, apart\nfrom the Devetak-Winter point, all other points in the achievable region have a\nrate sum strictly larger than the joint entropy. We can interpret the\ndifference as the price paid for the quantum encoder being ignorant of the\nclassical side information. In the general case, we give an achievable rate\nregion, via protocols that are built on the decoupling principle, and the\nprinciples of quantum state merging and quantum state redistribution.

They occur in biological models because of diffusion effects or as\nsimplifying modeling elements. We propose here to consider delayed stochastic\nreaction networks. The difficulty here lies in the fact that the state-space of\na delayed reaction network is infinite-dimensional, which makes their analysis\nmore involved. We demonstrate here that a particular class of stochastic\ntime-varying delays, namely those that follow a phase-type distribution, can be\nexactly implemented in terms of a chemical reaction network. Hence, any\ndelay-free network can be augmented to incorporate those delays through the\naddition of delay-species and delay-reactions. Hence, for this class of\nstochastic delays, which can be used to approximate any delay distribution\narbitrarily accurately, the state-space remains finite-dimensional and,\ntherefore, standard tools developed for standard reaction network still apply.\nIn particular, we demonstrate that for unimolecular mass-action reaction\nnetworks that the delayed stochastic reaction network is ergodic if and only if\nthe non-delayed network is ergodic as well. Bimolecular reactions are more\ndifficult to consider but an analogous result is also obtained. These results\ntell us that delays that are phase-type distributed, regardless of their\ndistribution, are not harmful to the ergodicity property of reaction networks.\nWe also prove that the presence of those delays adds convolution terms in the\nmoment equation but does not change the value of the stationary means compared\nto the delay-free case. Finally, the control of a certain class of delayed\nstochastic reaction network using a delayed antithetic integral controller is\nconsidered. It is proven that this controller achieves its goal provided that\nthe delay-free network satisfy the conditions of ergodicity and\noutput-controllability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Nov 2018 14:23:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 Sep 2019 22:33:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2019 06:48:13 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2020 17:14:28 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2020 18:36:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-27"}

Specifically, intra-network\nsharing is enabled by using extremely narrowband signals to connect a massive\nnumber of IoT devices without any prior network synchronization. Further, to\nenhance robustness to incumbent interference, each IoT packet is sent multiple\ntimes, each at a different frequency within a single band.

Both the low frequency\nBiot's (LF-Biot) equations and the Biot-Johnson-Koplik-Dashen (Biot-JKD) models\nare considered. In LF-Biot equations, the dissipation terms are proportional to\nthe relative velocity between the fluid and the solid by a constant. Contrast\nto this, the dissipation terms in the Biot-JKD model are in the form of time\nconvolution (memory) as a result of the frequency-dependence of fluid-solid\ninteraction at the underlying microscopic scale in the frequency domain. The\ndynamic tortuosity and permeability described by Darcy's law are two crucial\nfactors in this problem, and highly linked to the viscous force. In the Biot\nmodel, the key difficulty is to handle the viscous term when the pore fluid is\nviscous flow.

In the GUGE field theory there is no need to impose\neither of the so called \"cylinder\" or \"curling of coordinates\" conditions,\nbecause they emerge as direct consequences of the construction of the GUGE\nmetric. The GUGE field equations are fully equivalent to Einstein--Maxwell\nequations, while KK field equations are not. The GUGE 5--dimensional (geodesic)\nequations are equivalent to the 4--dimensional (non--geodesic) equations for a\ncharged particle moving in the presence of gravitational and electromagnetic\nfields, unlike the KK 5--dimensional (geodesic) equations which are not and, in\naddition, yield non--gauge covariant geodesic equations. No extra scalar field\nappears in GUGE. The physical interpretation of the fifth dimension and of the\nrole of the extra field in KK (internal coordinate in GUGE) are totally\ndifferent in both approaches. Finally, GUGE results include electric charge\nconservation, electric charge quantization and electric charge contribution to\nthe energy of charged particles even in the absence of electromagnetic fields,\nwhich implies (the observed fact) that there are no massless electrically\ncharged particles in Nature, unlike the prevailing treatments of KK theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Nov 2018 21:36:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 2 Mar 2019 14:45:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 5 Jun 2019 07:53:20 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 30 Jul 2019 22:50:10 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2019 14:41:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-22"}

These problems use information about physical systems in a certain\nrange of parameters or variables in order to make predictions at unknown values\nof these variables within the same range. The present work illustrates the\napplication of ML to prediction of physical properties outside the range of the\ntraining parameters. We define `physical extrapolation' to refer to accurate\npredictions $y(\\mathbf{x^\\ast})$ of a given physical property at a point\n$\\mathbf{x^\\ast} = [ x^\\ast_1, ..., x^\\ast_{\\cal D} ]$ in the $\\cal\nD$-dimensional space, if, at least, one of the variables $x^\\ast_i \\in \\left [\nx^\\ast_1, ..., x^\\ast_{\\cal D} \\right ]$ is {\\it outside} of the range covering\nthe training data. We show that Gaussian processes (GPs) can be used to build\nML models capable of physical extrapolation of quantum properties of complex\nsystems across quantum phase transitions. The approach is based on training GP\nmodels of variable complexity by the evolution of the physical functions. We\nshow that, as the complexity of the models increases, they become capable of\npredicting new transitions. We also show that, where the evolution of the\nphysical functions is analytic and relatively simple, GP models with simple\nkernels already yield accurate generalization results, allowing for accurate\npredictions of quantum properties in a different quantum phase. For more\ncomplex problems, it is necessary to build models with complex kernels. The\ncomplexity of the kernels is increased using the Bayesian Information Criterion\n(BIC). We illustrate the importance of the BIC by comparing the results with\nrandom kernels of various complexity and illustrate a method to obtain\nmeaningful extrapolation results without direct validation in the extrapolated\nregion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Nov 2018 18:28:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 21 Jul 2019 20:34:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-23"}

Current advanced electronic\ndevices use dielectric materials with a high dielectric constant and avoid high\nleakage currents. However, these materials show several intrinsic problems, and\nalso a bad interaction with adjacent materials. Therefore, the race for finding\na suitable dielectric material for current and future electronic devices is\nstill open. In this context two dimensional [2D] materials have become a\nserious option, not only thanks to their advanced properties, but also to the\ndevelopment of scalable synthesis methods. Graphene has been the most explored\n2D material for electronic devices. However, graphene has no band gap, and\ntherefore it cannot be used as dielectric. MoS2 and other 2D transition metal\ndichalcogenides (TMDs) are semiconducting 2D materials that can provide more\nversatility in electronic devices. In this PhD thesis I have investigated the\nuse of monolayer and multilayer hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as dielectric\nfor electronic devices, as it is a 2D material with a band gap of ~5.9 eV. My\nwork has mainly focused on the synthesis of the h-BN using chemical vapor\ndeposition, the study of its intrinsic morphological and electrical properties\nat the nanoscale, and its performance as dielectric in different electronic\ndevices, such as capacitors and memristors. Overall, our experiments indicate\nthat h-BN is a very reliable dielectric material, and that it can be\nsuccessfully used in capacitors and memristors. Moreover, h-BN shows additional\nperformances never observed in traditional dielectrics, such as volatile\nresistive switching, which may also open the door for new applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Nov 2018 03:07:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-17"}
