It is known (since the work of Pansu and\nSemmes) that the metric space $(H,d)$ cannot be embedded in a bilipchitz\nfashion into a Hilbert space; however, from a general theorem of Assouad, for\nany $0 < \\varepsilon < 1$, the snowflaked metric space $(H,d^{1-\\varepsilon})$\nembeds into an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space with distortion $O(\n\\varepsilon^{-1/2} )$. This distortion bound was shown by Austin, Naor, and\nTessera to be sharp for the Heisenberg group $H$. Assouad's argument allows\n$\\ell^2$ to be replaced by ${\\mathbf R}^{D(\\varepsilon)}$ for some dimension\n$D(\\varepsilon)$ dependent on $\\varepsilon$.

The films are grown in ultrahigh\nvacuum and their magnetic response is measured using the magneto-optic Kerr\neffect (MOKE). The analysis of many independently grown films shows that the\nparamagnetic tail of the susceptibility is described by $\\chi(T) \\sim \\exp\n\\bigr{(}B/(T/T_{KT}-1)^a\\bigl{)}$, where $a=0.50\\pm0.03$ and $B=3.48\\pm0.16$,\nin quantitative agreement with KT theory. Below the finite-size transition\ntemperature $T_C(L)$, the behavior is complicated by dissipation (likely\nrelated to the re-emergence of fourfold anisotropy and magnetic domains). A\nsubset of measurements with very small dissipation most closely represents the\nidealized system treated by theory. In these, the temperature interval between\nthe fitted Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature and the finite-size\ntransition temperature is $T_C(L)/T_{KT} -1=0.065\\pm0.016$. This yeids an\nestimate of the finite size $L$ affecting the film of order micrometers. This\ngives experimental support to the idea that even a mesoscopic limitation of the\nvortex-antivortex gas results in a substantial finite-size effect at the KT\ntransition. In contrast, fitting the paramagnetic tail to a power law,\nappropriate to a second order critical transition, does not give reasonable\nresults. The effective critical exponent $\\gamma_{eff} \\approx 3.7 \\pm 0.7$\ndoes not correspond to a known universality class, and the fitted transition\ntemperature is much further below the peak in the susceptibility than is\nreasonable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Nov 2018 16:58:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Apr 2019 17:35:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-10"}

Rather than naively comparing\nschool average scores, which largely reflect school intake differences in prior\nattainment, these measures attempt to compare the average progress or\nimprovement pupils make during a year or phase of schooling. Schools, however,\nalso differ in terms of their pupil demographic and socioeconomic\ncharacteristics and these also predict why some schools subsequently score\nhigher than others. Many therefore argue that value-added measures unadjusted\nfor pupil background are biased in favour of schools with more 'educationally\nadvantaged' intakes. But, others worry that adjusting for pupil background\nentrenches socioeconomic inequities and excuses low performing schools. In this\narticle we explore these theoretical arguments and their practical importance\nin the context of the 'Progress 8' secondary school accountability system in\nEngland which has chosen to ignore pupil background. We reveal how the reported\nlow or high performance of many schools changes dramatically once adjustments\nare made for pupil background and these changes also affect the reported\ndifferential performances of region and of different school types. We conclude\nthat accountability systems which choose to ignore pupil background are likely\nto reward and punish the wrong schools and this will likely have detrimental\neffects on pupil learning. These findings, especially when coupled with more\ngeneral concerns surrounding high-stakes testing and school value-added models,\nraise serious doubts about their use in school accountability systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Nov 2018 17:12:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-26"}

While current latent\nvariable models are known to solve the first two challenges, they are not\nflexible to different word sense granularities, which differ very much among\nwords, from aardvark with one sense, to play with over 50 senses. Current\nmodels either require hyperparameter tuning or nonparametric induction of the\nnumber of senses, which we find both to be ineffective. Thus, we aim to\neliminate these requirements and solve the sense granularity problem by\nproposing AutoSense, a latent variable model based on two observations: (1)\nsenses are represented as a distribution over topics, and (2) senses generate\npairings between the target word and its neighboring word. These observations\nalleviate the problem by (a) throwing garbage senses and (b) additionally\ninducing fine-grained word senses. Results show great improvements over the\nstate-of-the-art models on popular WSI datasets. We also show that AutoSense is\nable to learn the appropriate sense granularity of a word. Finally, we apply\nAutoSense to the unsupervised author name disambiguation task where the sense\ngranularity problem is more evident and show that AutoSense is evidently better\nthan competing models.

In\nimage classification, an adversarial example is a carefully modified image that\nis visually imperceptible to the original image but can cause DNN model to\nmisclassify it. Training the network with Gaussian noise is an effective\ntechnique to perform model regularization, thus improving model robustness\nagainst input variation. Inspired by this classical method, we explore to\nutilize the regularization characteristic of noise injection to improve DNN's\nrobustness against adversarial attack. In this work, we propose\nParametric-Noise-Injection (PNI) which involves trainable Gaussian noise\ninjection at each layer on either activation or weights through solving the\nmin-max optimization problem, embedded with adversarial training. These\nparameters are trained explicitly to achieve improved robustness. To the best\nof our knowledge, this is the first work that uses trainable noise injection to\nimprove network robustness against adversarial attacks, rather than manually\nconfiguring the injected noise level through cross-validation.

In\naddition, its importance is further increased with growing uncertainties in the\ngeneration sector due to the high penetration of renewable energy and the\nintroduction of demand side management strategies. An incremental improvement\nin grid-level demand forecast of anomalous days can potentially save millions\nof dollars. However, due to an increasing penetration of renewable energy\nresources and their dependency on several meteorological and exogenous\nvariables, accurate load forecasting of anomalous days has now become very\nchallenging. To improve the prediction accuracy of the load forecasting, an\nensemble forecast framework (ENFF) is proposed with a systematic combination of\nthree multiple predictors, namely Elman neural network (ELM), feedforward\nneural network (FNN) and radial basis function (RBF) neural network.

It is desirable to achieve the maximal test accuracy under given\ninference budget constraints when deploying a pre-trained model. Network\npruning is a commonly used technique while it may produce irregular sparse\nmodels that can hardly gain actual speed-up. Group convolution is a promising\npruning target due to its regular structure; however, incorporating such\nstructure into the pruning procedure is challenging. It is because structural\nconstraints are hard to describe and can make pruning intractable to solve. The\nneed for configuring group convolution architecture, i.e., the number of\ngroups, that maximises test accuracy also increases difficulty.\n  This paper presents an efficient method to address this challenge.

The growth and development of root systems contribute to\ncolonizing the surrounding soil and optimizing the access to resources. It is\nusually admitted that the variability of plant root architecture results from\nthe combination of genetic, physiological and environmental factors, in\nparticular soil mechanical impedance. However this last factor has never been\ninvestigated at the soil grain scale. In this paper, we are interested in the\neffect of the disordered texture of granular soils on the evolution of external\nforces experienced by root cap. We introduce a numerical model in which the\nroot is modeled as a flexible self-elongating tube that probes a soil composed\nof solid particles. By means of extensive simulations, we show that the forces\nexerted on the root cap during its growth reflect interparticle force chains.\nOur extensive simulations also show that the mean force declines exponentially\nwith root flexibility, the highest force corresponding to the soil hardness.\nFurthermore, we find that this functional dependence is characterized by a\nsingle parameter that combines the granular structure and root bending\nstiffness. This finding will be useful to further address the biological issues\nof mechanosensing and thigmomorphogenesis in plant roots.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Nov 2018 01:50:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-24"}

Many\nattempts, such as decreasing an adaptive learning rate, adopting a big batch\nsize, incorporating a temporal decorrelation technique, seeking an analogous\nsurrogate, etc., have been tried to promote Adam/RMSProp-type algorithms to\nconverge. In contrast with existing approaches, we introduce an alternative\neasy-to-check sufficient condition, which merely depends on the parameters of\nthe base learning rate and combinations of historical second-order moments, to\nguarantee the global convergence of generic Adam/RMSProp for solving\nlarge-scale non-convex stochastic optimization. Moreover, we show that the\nconvergences of several variants of Adam, such as AdamNC, AdaEMA, etc., can be\ndirectly implied via the proposed sufficient condition in the non-convex\nsetting.

To better model human language,\nwe first model expressive nonverbal representations by analyzing the\nfine-grained visual and acoustic patterns that occur during word segments.

The problem is challenging because the rate of P450\nmetabolism depends upon both the intrinsic chemical reactivity of the site and\nthe protein-ligand geometry that is energetically accessible in the active site\nof a given P450 isozyme. We have addressed this problem using a two-level\nscreening system. The first level implements an empirical QSAR-based scoring\nfunction employing the local chemical motifs to characterize the intrinsic\nreactivity. The second level uses molecular docking and molecular mechanics to\naccount for the geometrical effects, including induced-fit effects in the\nprotein which can be very important in P450 interactions with ligands. This\napproach has achieved high accuracy for both the P450 3A4 and 2D6 isoforms. In\nidentifying at least one metabolic site in the top two ranked positions, the\nprediction rate can reach as high as 92.7% for the test set of isoform 3A4. For\nthe 2D6 isoform, 100% accuracy is achieved on this basic evaluation metric,\nand, because this active site is considerably smaller and more selective than\n3A4, very high precision is attained for full prediction of all metabolic\nsites. The method also requires considerably less CPU time than our previous\nefforts, which involved a large number of expensive simulations for each ligand\nto be evaluated. After screening using the empirical score function, only a few\nbest candidates are left for each ligand, making the number of necessary\nestimations in the second level very small, which significantly reduces the\ncomputation time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Nov 2018 05:44:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-26"}

In addition to five honeycomb structures of\narsenene, a total of eight other structures are considered in this study. An\nextensive analysis comprising energetics, phonon spectra and mechanical\nproperties confirms that these structures are energetically and dynamically\nstable. All these structures are semiconductors with a broad range of band gap\nvarying from ~1 eV to ~2.5 eV. Significantly, these monolayer allotropes\npossess anisotropic carrier mobilities as high as several hundred\ncm^{2}V^{-1}s^{-1} which is comparable with the well-known 2D materials such as\nblack phosphorene and monolayer MoS_{2}. Combining such broad band gaps and\nsuperior carrier mobilities, these monolayer allotropes can be promising\ncandidates for the superior performance of the next generation nanoscale\ndevices.

An analytical solution is permitted via integration of the Euler\nequations. Although similar problems were investigated in the 1960's and 70's\nfor special cases of resonance, this is to our knowledge the first general wave\ninteraction (mode coupling) solution derived to second order with a shear\ncurrent present. Wave interactions are integrable in a spectral convolution to\nyield the second order dynamics of initial value problems.\n  To second order, irrotational wave dynamics interacts with the background\nvorticity field in a way that creates new vortex structures. A notable example\nis the large parallel vortices which drive Langmuir circulation as oblique\nplane waves interact with an ocean current. We also investigate the effect on\nwave pairs which are misaligned with the shear current. In contrast to a\nconjecture by Leibovich (1983) we find similar, but skewed, vortex structures\nin every case except when the mean wave direction is perpendicular to the\ndirection of the current. Similar nonlinear wave-shear interactions are found\nto also generate near-field vortex structures in the Cauchy-Poisson problem\nwith an initial surface elevation. These interactions create further groups of\ndispersive ring waves in addition to those present in linear theory.\n  The second order solution is derived in a general manner which accommodates\nany initial condition through mode coupling over a continuous wave spectrum. It\nis therefore applicable to a range of problems including special cases of\nresonance. As a by--product of the general theory, a simple expression for the\nStokes drift due to a monochromatic wave propagating at oblique angle with a\ncurrent of uniform vorticity is derived, for the first time to our knowledge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Nov 2018 09:23:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

In this paper, we have investigated the interaction of an artificial\natom and SAWs beyond the weak coupling regime, focusing on the role of the\ninterdigital transducer (IDT) that enables the coupling. We find a parameter\nregime in which the IDT acts as a cavity for the atom, rather than an antenna.\nIn other words, the atom forms its own cavity. Similar to an atom coupled to an\nexplicit cavity, this regime is characterized by vacuum-Rabi splitting, as the\natom hybridizes with the phononic vacuum inside the IDT. This hybridization is\npossible because of the interdigitated coupling, which has a large spatial\nextension, and the slow propagation speed of SAWs. We work out a criterion for\nentering this regime from a model based on standard circuit-quantization\ntechniques, taking only material parameters as inputs. Most notably, we find\nthis regime hard to avoid for an atom on top of a strong piezoelectric\nmaterial, such as LiNbO$_3$. The SAW-coupled atom on top of LiNbO$_3$ can thus\nbe regarded as an atom-cavity-bath system.

Here, we consider sequential phase I trials, where the trial\nproceeds with a new schedule (e.g. daily or weekly dosing) once the dose\nescalation with another schedule has been completed. The aim is to utilize the\ninformation from both the completed and the ongoing dose-escalation trial to\ninform decisions on the dose level for the next dose cohort.

A\nvoter's social connections are assumed to consist of contacts on social media\nand geographically proximate people.

Such\ninterference results in asymmetric absorption lines such as Fano resonances,\nand gives rise to secondary effects like electromagnetically induced\ntransparency (EIT) when multiple optical transitions are pumped. Few\nsolid-state systems show quantum interference and EIT, with quantum-well\nintersubband transitions in the IR offering the most promising avenue to date\nto devices exploiting optical gain without inversion. Quantum interference is\nusually hampered by inhomogeneous broadening of electronic transitions, making\nit challenging to achieve in solids at visible wavelengths and elevated\ntemperatures. However, disorder effects can be mitigated by raising the\noscillator strength of atom-like electronic transitions - excitons - which\narise in monolayers of transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). Quantum\ninterference, probed by second-harmonic generation (SHG), emerges in monolayer\nWSe2, without a cavity, splitting the SHG spectrum. The splitting exhibits\nspectral anticrossing behaviour, and is related to the number of Rabi flops the\nstrongly driven system undergoes. The SHG power-law exponent deviates strongly\nfrom the canonical value of 2, showing a Fano-like wavelength dependence which\nis retained at room temperature.

Based on\nthis classification, we obtain that low mass haloes are embedded in denser\nenvironments if they have acquired angular momentum below the TTT expectations\n(L haloes), whereas at high masses enhanced clustering is typically associated\nwith higher angular momentum growths (W haloes). Additionally, we find that the\nlow mass signal has a weak dependence on the direction, whereas the high mass\nsignal is entirely due to the structure perpendicular to the angular momentum.\nFinally, we study the anisotropy of the matter distribution around haloes as a\nfunction of their mass.

When interacting with\nmatter, the optical orbital angular momentum (OAM) carried by the vortex and\nquantified by its topological charge is transferred to the charge carriers.

First, the origin of Homo-specific\nculture over two MYA was made possible by the onset of a finer-grained\nassociative memory that allowed episodes to be encoded in greater detail. This\nin turn meant more overlap amongst the distributed representations of these\nepisodes, such that they could more readily evoke one another through\nself-triggered recall (STR). STR enabled representational redescription, the\nchaining of thoughts and actions, and the capacity for a stream of thought.\nSecond, fully cognitive modernity following the appearance of anatomical\nmodernity after 200,000 BP, was made possible by the onset of contextual focus\n(CF): the ability to shift between an explicit convergent mode conducive to\nlogic and refinement of ideas, and an implicit divergent mode conducive to\nfree-association, viewing situations from radically new perspectives, concept\ncombination, analogical thinking, and insight. This paved the way for an\nintegrated, creative internal network of understandings, and behavioral\nmodernity. We discuss feasible neural mechanisms for this two-stage proposal,\nand outline how STR and CF differ from other proposals. We provide\ncomputational evidence for the proposal obtained with an agent-based model of\ncultural evolution in which agents invent ideas for actions and imitate the\nfittest of their neighbors' actions. Mean fitness and diversity of actions\nacross the artificial society increased with STR, and even more so with CF, but\nCF was only effective if STR was already in place. CF was most effective\nfollowing a change in task, which supports its hypothesized role in escaping\nmental fixation. The proposal is discussed in the context of transition theory\nin the life sciences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Nov 2018 06:11:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Jul 2019 22:02:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-09"}

In\nthe case of univariate data analysis we discuss stochastic processes with\nauto-correlated increments and univariate distributions derived from specific\nstochastic processes, i.e. Levy and Tsallis distributions. Deep investigation\nof multivariate non-Gaussian distributions requires the copula approach. A\ncopula is an component of multivariate distribution that models the mutual\ninterdependence between marginals. There are many copula families characterised\nby various measures of the dependence between marginals. Importantly, one of\nthose are `tail' dependencies that model the simultaneous appearance of extreme\nvalues in many marginals.

Next we\ndiscuss higher order multivariate cumulants that are non-zero if multivariate\ndistribution is non-Gaussian.

To this end, in the first step, using\nthe tight-binding Hamiltonian, we obtain an analytic solution on the lattice\nfor the state associated to a single vacancy located in the bulk phosphorene\nwhich shows a highly anisotropic localization in real space. For a finite\nzigzag ribbon, in the absence of particle-hole symmetry, the localized state\ninduced by vacancies can couple to the wave functions of the edge states which\nresults in the formation of a new bound state. The energy of vacancy bound\nstate lies inside the quasi-flat band composed of edge states when the vacancy\nlocates sufficiently far away from the edge. Then, we employ the T-matrix\nLippmann-Schwinger approach to obtain an explicit analytical expression for the\nscattering amplitude of the edge electrons of a zPNR by the presence of a\nsingle vacancy which shows a Fano resonance profile with a tunable dip. We\ndemonstrate that varying the position of the vacancy produces substantially\ndifferent effects on the resonance width, resonance energy position, and the\nasymmetry parameter of Fano line shape.
