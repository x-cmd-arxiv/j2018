Despite that\nCQs are a part of several ontology engineering methodologies, we have observed\nthat the actual publication of CQs for the available ontologies is very limited\nand even scarcer is the publication of their respective formalisations in terms\nof, e.g., SPARQL queries. This paper aims to contribute to addressing the\nengineering shortcomings of using CQs in ontology development, to facilitate\nwider use of CQs. In order to understand the relation between CQs and the\nqueries over the ontology to test the CQs on an ontology, we gather, analyse,\nand publicly release a set of 234 CQs and their translations to SPARQL-OWL for\nseveral ontologies in different domains developed by different groups. We\nanalysed the CQs in two principal ways. The first stage focused on a linguistic\nanalysis of the natural language text itself, i.e., a lexico-syntactic analysis\nwithout any presuppositions of ontology elements, and a subsequent step of\nsemantic analysis in order to find patterns. This increased diversity of CQ\nsources resulted in a 5-fold increase of hitherto published patterns, to 106\ndistinct CQ patterns, which have a limited subset of few patterns shared across\nthe CQ sets from the different ontologies. Next, we analysed the relation\nbetween the found CQ patterns and the 46 SPARQL-OWL query signatures, which\nrevealed that one CQ pattern may be realised by more than one SPARQL-OWL query\nsignature, and vice versa. We hope that our work will contribute to\nestablishing common practices, templates, automation, and user tools that will\nsupport CQ formulation, formalisation, execution, and general management.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Nov 2018 16:00:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-26"}

Many prospective applications would benefit from nonlinear\neffects, which not only are naturally present in real systems but also are\nneeded for switching in computational processes, while the underlying particle\ninteractions are a key ingredient for the manifestation of genuine quantum\neffects. A particularly attractive switching mechanism of dynamical systems are\ninfinite-period bifurcations into limit cycles, as these set on with a finite\namplitude. Here we describe how to realize this switching mechanism by\ncombining attractive and repulsive particle interactions in a\ndriven-dissipative Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, such as realized in excitonic\nlasers and condensates so that the system displays a nonhermitian combination\nof parity and charge-conjugation (PC) symmetry.

These protected dynamical\nsolutions display a number of characteristic features, among which are their\nfinite amplitude at onset, their arbitrary long oscillation period close to\nthreshold, and the symmetry of their frequency spectrum which provides a\ntuneable frequency comb. Phases with different transition scenarios are\nseparated by exceptional points in the stability spectrum, involving\nnonhermitian degeneracies of symmetry-protected excitations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Nov 2018 16:27:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-04"}

The molecular mechanisms\nguiding ABPs to specific actin networks are still poorly understood, but\ncooperativity, the mechanism by which the binding of an ABP is positively\ninfluenced by proximal bound ABPs, plays a crucial role in generating locally\ndense stretches of ABPs. Cooperative binding is characterized by its amplitude,\nbut also by the range at which its effects are propagated along an actin\nfilament through long-range allosteric interactions. The range of these\nallosteric effects is still debated, but is likely to be significant at the\nlengthscale of actin filaments in cells. Here, we investigated how\ncooperativity influences the clustering of ABPs, using a stochastic\ncomputational model of binding of ABPs to actin filaments. The model reproduces\nthe formation of ABP clusters observed experimentally at the single filament\nscale, and provides a theoretical estimation of the range of cooperativity for\nproteins such as ADF/cofilin. We found that both the amplitude and the spatial\nrange of cooperativity dramatically impact the properties of clustering.\nHowever, the parameters of cooperativity modulate differently the rate of\nassembly, size and dynamics of the ABP clusters, suggesting that cooperativity\nis an efficient mechanism to regulate precisely the recruitment of ABPs in\ncells.

We show that, provided strong coupling and fast\nenough rewiring are considered, the network is able to reach partial\nsynchronization even in the vanishing connectivity limit. We also provide an\nintuitive analytical argument, based on the comparison between the different\ncharacteristic timescales of our system in the low connectivity regime, which\nis able to predict the transition to synchronization threshold with\nsatisfactory precision. In the formal fast switching limit, finally, we argue\nthat the onset of collective synchronization is captured by the time-averaged\nconnectivity network. Our results may be relevant to qualitatively describe the\nemergence of consensus in social communities with time-varying interactions and\nto study the onset of collective behavior in engineered systems of mobile units\nwith limited wireless capabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Nov 2018 18:35:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-26"}

Several additional, weaker spiral arms may also\nform in the inner disk. On the contrary, a secondary spiral arm is unlikely to\nform in the outer disk. Our linear calculations, fully accounting for the\nglobal behavior of both the phases and amplitudes of perturbations, generally\nsupport the recently proposed WKB phase argument for the secondary arm origin\n(as caused by the intricacy of constructive interference of azimuthal harmonics\nof the perturbation at different radii). We provide analytical arguments\nshowing that the process of a single spiral wake splitting up into multiple\narms is a generic linear outcome of wave propagation in differentially rotating\ndisks. It is not unique to planet-driven waves and occurs also in linear\ncalculations of spiral wakes freely propagating with no external torques. These\nresults are relevant for understanding formation of multiple rings and gaps in\nprotoplanetary disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Nov 2018 19:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Dec 2018 00:17:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 18 Mar 2019 01:01:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-17"}

Sen that the entropy of two-charge supersymmetric\nbound states in string theory should be accounted for by adding the entropy of\nsource-free horizonless supergravity solutions to the entropy associated with\nthe horizons of small black holes. This would imply that the entropy arises\ndifferently depending on the duality frame: in the D1-D5 frame one would count\nsource-free horizonless solutions, while in the NS1-P frame one would compute\nthe area of a horizon. This might lead to the belief that the microstates are\ndescribed by fuzzball solutions in the D1-D5 duality frame but by a black hole\nwith a horizon in the latter. We argue that this is not the case, and that the\nmicrostates are fuzzballs in all duality frames. We observe that the scaling\nargument used by Sen fails to account for the entropy in the D1-P and other\nduality frames. We also note that the traditional extremal black hole solution\nis not a complete string background, since finite-action paths connect the\nexterior near-horizon extremal throat to the region inside the horizon,\nincluding the singularity. The singularity of the traditional black hole\nsolution does not give a valid boundary condition for a fundamental string;\ncorrecting this condition by resolving the singularity modifies the black hole\nto a fuzzball with no horizon.

In addition, we show for the first\ntime that the previously known companion candidate around HD 204313 is likely a\nbackground object. By comparison with secondary epochs of 2MASS data we show\nthat the companion candidates around GJ176 and HD 40307, as well as two of the\nsources around HD 85390, are likely background objects. For HD 113538 and HD\n190984, as well as multiple further companion candidates around HD 85390,\nfurther observational data is required to test common proper motion of the\ncompanion candidates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Nov 2018 20:25:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-12"}

They allow participants to\nvote for or against adding items to a list through a process that involves\nstaking tokens intrinsic to the registry, with winners receiving the staked\ntokens for each vote. A TCR aims to provide incentives to create a well-curated\nlist. In this work, we consider a challenge for these systems - incentivizing\ntoken-holders to actually engage and participate in the voting process. We\npropose a novel token-inflation mechanism for enhancing engagement, whereby\nonly voting participants see their token supply increased by a pre-defined\nmultiple after each round of voting. To evaluate this proposal, we propose a\nsimple 4-class model of voters that captures all possible combinations of two\nkey dimensions: whether they are engaged (likely to vote at all for a given\nitem) or disengaged, and whether they are informed (likely to vote in a way\nthat increases the quality of the list) or uninformed, and a simple metric to\nevaluate the quality of the list as a function of the vote outcomes. We conduct\nsimulations using this model of voters and show that implementing\ntoken-inflation results in greater wealth accumulation for engaged voters. In\nparticular, when the number of informed voters is sufficiently high, our\nsimulations show that voters that are both informed and engaged see the\ngreatest benefits from participating in the registry when our proposed\ntoken-inflation mechanism is employed. We further validate this finding using a\nsimplified mathematical analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Nov 2018 20:51:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-27"}

However, since serverless platforms are relatively\nnew, they have a completely different pricing model that depends on the memory,\nduration, and the number of executions of a sequence/workflow of functions. In\nthis paper we present an algorithm that optimizes the price of serverless\napplications in AWS Lambda.

They also provide rich opportunities for\nspatial analytics in the field of marketing science. Our main interest is to\npropose a new efficient statistical framework to conduct spatial segmentation\nanalysis for restaurants located in a metropolitan area in the U.S. The spatial\nsegmentation problem poses important statistical challenges: selecting the\noptimal number of underlying structures of market segments, capturing complex\nand flexible spatial structures, and resolving any possible small n and large p\nissue which can be typical in latent class analysis. Existing approaches try to\ntackle these issues in heuristic ways or seem silent on them. To overcome these\nchallenges, we propose a new statistical framework based on regularized\nBayesian spatial mixture regressions with Dirichlet process integrating ridge\nor lasso regularization. Our simulation study demonstrates that the proposed\nmodels successfully recover the underlying spatial clustering structures and\noutperforms two existing benchmark models. In the empirical analysis using\nonline customer satisfaction data from the Yelp, our models provides\ninteresting insights on segment-level key drivers of customer satisfaction and\ninterpretable relationships between regional demographics and restaurants'\ncharacteristics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Nov 2018 01:01:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-27"}

For a typical critical\nfragmentation velocity of silicate dust particles of $1~{\\rm m~s^{-1}}$, the\nstress to pressure ratio $\\alpha_{\\rm dead}$ needs to be lower than $3 \\times\n10^{-4}$ for dust trapping to operate.

Among many possibilities, Mean Average Precision(mAP) has emerged as\nthe dominant performance metric for hashing-based retrieval. One glaring\nshortcoming of mAP is its inability in balancing retrieval accuracy and\nutilization of hash codes: pushing a system to attain higher mAP will\ninevitably lead to poorer utilization of the hash codes. Poor utilization of\nthe hash codes hinders good retrieval because of increased collision of samples\nin the hash space. This means that a model giving a higher mAP values does not\nnecessarily do a better job in retrieval. In this paper, we introduce a new\nmetric named Mean Local Group Average Precision (mLGAP) for better evaluation\nof the performance of hashing-based retrieval. The new metric provides a\nretrieval performance measure that also reconciles the utilization of hash\ncodes, leading to a more practically meaningful performance metric than\nconventional ones like mAP.

In addition, the effects of secular change in\nthe geomagnetic field have not previously been allowed for. As a result, the\ncomponents of the 'classical' $aa$ index for the southern and northern\nhemispheres ($aa_S$ and $aa_N$) have drifted apart.

Our\napproach is to correct the quantized aK-values for each station, originally\nscaled on the assumption that ${\\delta}$ values are constant, with\ntime-dependent scale factors that allow for the drift in ${\\delta}$. This\nrequires revisiting the intercalibration of successive stations used in making\nthe $aa_S$ and $aa_N$ composites. These intercalibrations are defined using\nindependent data and daily averages from 11 years before and after each station\nchange and it is shown that they depend on the time of year.

Recent studies have shown that the\nMTO method can be approximately 3 and 30 times faster than the traditional\ntopology optimization method for 2D and 3D problems, respectively. To further\nexploit the potential of decoupling analysis and design, we propose a\ndp-adaptive MTO method, which involves locally increasing/decreasing the shape\nfunction orders (p) and design resolution (d). The adaptive\nrefinement/coarsening is performed using a composite refinement indicator which\nincludes criteria based on analysis error, presence of intermediate densities\nas well as the occurrence of design artefacts referred to as QR-patterns. While\nstandard MTO must rely on filtering to suppress QR-patterns, the proposed\nadaptive method ensures efficiently that these artefacts are suppressed in the\nfinal design, without sacrificing the design resolution. The applicability of\nthe dp-adaptive MTO method is demonstrated on several 2D mechanical design\nproblems. For all the cases, significant speed-ups in computational time are\nobtained. In particular for design problems involving low material volume\nfractions, speed-ups of up to a factor of 10 can be obtained over the\nconventional MTO method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Nov 2018 12:24:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-27"}

However, since data about financial linkages are typically subject to\nconfidentiality, network reconstruction techniques become necessary to infer\nboth the presence of connections and their intensity. Recently, several \"horse\nraces\" have been conducted to compare the performance of the available\nfinancial network reconstruction methods. These comparisons, however, were\nbased on arbitrarily-chosen similarity metrics between the real and the\nreconstructed network. Here we establish a generalised maximum-likelihood\napproach to rigorously define and compare weighted reconstruction methods. Our\ngeneralization maximizes the conditional entropy to solve the problem\nrepresented by the fact that the density-dependent constraints required to\nreliably reconstruct the network are typically unobserved. The resulting\napproach admits as input any reconstruction method for the purely binary\ntopology and, conditionally on the latter, exploits the available partial\ninformation to infer link weights. We find that the most reliable method is\nobtained by \"dressing\" the best-performing binary method with an exponential\ndistribution of link weights having a properly density-corrected and\nlink-specific mean value and propose two unbiased (in the sense of maximum\nconditional entropy) variants of it. While the one named CReMA is perfectly\ngeneral (as a particular case, it can place optimal weights on a network whose\ntopology is known), the one named CReMB is recommended both in case of full\nuncertainty about the network topology and if the existence of some links is\ncertain.

The surface code uses only single- and\ntwo-qubit gates and the error threshold falls close to 1% for a large range of\nerrors. Among the most promising candidates to physically implement such\ncircuits and codes are superconducting qubits coupled by resonators. We\ninvestigate a X and Z stabilizing circuit realized by two data qubits, two\nancillas and four resonators. The aim is to assess the consequences of unitary\nevolution of the interacting system, in particular for given stable initial\nstates, on fidelities and error syndrome probabilities. We model the system\nwith a Jaynes-Tavis-Cummings Hamiltonian and construct the low-excitation level\nevolution operators. The analysis is limited to two stable input states. We\nassume an ideal system with perfect gates, perfect measurements and no\ndecoherence or leakage. Our analysis shows that the capture probabilities after\nthe execution of a single stabilizer round are not equal to 100%, but vary\nbetween 99.2% and 99.99%. This is caused solely by the unitary evolution of the\ninteracting system. Two consecutive rounds of stabilizer measurements result in\ncapture probability values that depend heavily on the duration of the\nevolution, but vary between 0% and 99%. Also due to the unitary evolution, the\nfinal state of the data qubits leaves the the four-dimensional subspace, which\nresults in a state fidelity oscillating between 0 and 1. Even if an error on\nthe qubits is captured, the correcting operation on the qubit will not bring\nthe qubit to the original state. The errors induced by the Hamiltonian\nevolution of the system cannot be interpreted nor classified as commonly\nappearing errors.

The training processes of the\nautoencoder is shown to depend dramatically on the reduced dimension: a\nlearning curve saturates when the dimension is too small and decays if it is\nsufficient for a lossless information transfer. The smallest sufficient value\nis considered as a dimension of the inertial manifold, and the autoencoder\nimplements a mapping onto the inertial manifold and back.

Traditionally, this is accomplished by\nvisually picking the salt/sediment boundaries, which requires a great amount of\nmanual work and may introduce systematic bias. With recent progress of deep\nlearning algorithm and growing computational power, a great deal of efforts\nhave been made to replace human effort with machine power in salt body\ninterpretation. Currently, the method of Convolutional neural networks (CNN) is\nrevolutionizing the computer vision field and has been a hot topic in the image\nanalysis. In this paper, the benefits of CNN-based classification are\ndemonstrated by using a state-of-art network structure U-Net, along with the\nresidual learning framework ResNet, to delineate salt body with high precision.\nNetwork adjustments, including the Exponential Linear Units (ELU) activation\nfunction, the Lov\\'{a}sz-Softmax loss function, and stratified $K$-fold\ncross-validation, have been deployed to further improve the prediction\naccuracy.

In\naddition, the agents have their own beliefs instead of the true prior, and have\nnonidentical noise variances in the private signal. We focus on the Bayes risk\nof the last agent, where preceding agents are selfish.\n  We first derive the optimal decision rule by recursive belief update and\nconclude, counterintuitively, that beliefs deviating from the true prior could\nbe optimal in this setting. The effect of nonidentical noise levels in the\ntwo-agent case is also considered and analytical properties of the optimal\nbelief curves are given. Next, we consider a predecessor selection problem\nwherein the subsequent agent of a certain belief chooses a predecessor from a\nset of candidates with varying beliefs. We characterize the decision region for\nchoosing such a predecessor and argue that a subsequent agent with beliefs\nvarying from the true prior often ends up selecting a suboptimal predecessor,\nindicating the need for a social planner.
