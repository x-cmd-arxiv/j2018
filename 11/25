For hydrogen atom at different states in lattice, we obtained\nEvac increased from 26.3% to 84.6% and EH-vac increased from 40.6% to 119.3%.\nThis indicates that the bond between the original Zr atoms is weakened by\nhydrogen atoms entering the lattice and formation of vacancy is more possible.\nIn addition, vacancies make hydrogen atoms and Zr atoms more closely connected\nand further increases the vacancies formation.

Under these challenging conditions, neither local nor global\nfeature-based image matching methods, when used in isolation, have been\nobserved to be effective. The proposed correspondence determination scheme for\nmatching disparate images exploits high-level shape cues that are derived from\nlow-level local feature descriptors, thus combining the best of both worlds. A\ngraph-based representation for the disparate image pair is generated by\nconstructing an affinity matrix that embeds the distances between feature\npoints in two images, thus modeling the correspondence determination problem as\none of graph matching. The eigenspectrum of the affinity matrix, i.e., the\nlearned global shape representation, is then used to further regress the\ntransformation or homography that defines the correspondence between the source\nimage and target image.

Typically,\nthe gyroradius is small compared to the system size and thus the gyromotion can\nbe averaged out. The resulting charged particle motion closely follows a\nmagnetic field line. At the edge of fusion devices, the magnetic field usually\nimpinges on a wall at a shallow angle. A boundary layer forms in which the\nplasma density changes over a characteristic distance from the wall of the\norder of the ion gyroradius, as ions are absorbed during their gyromotion. This\nboundary layer is called magnetic presheath, and is typically collisionless and\nquasineutral. Importantly, the electric field in this region distorts the ion\ngyro-orbits, making them non-circular and thus affecting the ion density\nprofile. Solving the magnetic presheath amounts to obtaining the\nself-consistent electric field for which the net charge density is zero.\n  In this thesis, I assume a small magnetic field angle and small gradients\nparallel to the wall to develop an asymptotic theory for the magnetic\npresheath, which is used to obtain the ion density.

It is standard to model the DM\nas an ideal fluid with a thermal Maxwell-Boltzmann (MB) velocity distribution,\nin order to compute the heat and momentum-exchange rates relevant to these\nprobes. This approximation only applies in the limit where DM self-interactions\nare frequent enough to efficiently redistribute DM velocities.

A detailed understanding of\nevacuation behavior is fundamental to the development of efficient emergency\nplans. Once a household decides to evacuate, a key behavioral issue is the time\nat which individuals depart to reach their destination. An accurate estimation\nof evacuation departure time is useful to predict evacuation demand over time\nand develop effective evacuation strategies. In addition, the time it takes for\nevacuees to reach their preferred destinations is important. A holistic\nunderstanding of the factors that affect travel time is useful to emergency\nofficials in controlling road traffic and helps in preventing adverse\nconditions like traffic jams. Past studies suggest that departure time and\ntravel time can be related. Hence, an important question arises whether there\nis an interdependence between evacuation departure time and travel time? Does\ndeparting close to the landfall increases the possibility of traveling short\ndistances? Are people more likely to depart early when destined to longer\ndistances? In this study, we present a model to jointly estimate departure and\ntravel times during hurricane evacuations. Empirical results underscore the\nimportance of accommodating an inter-relationship among these dimensions of\nevacuation behavior. This paper also attempts to empirically investigate the\ninfluence of social ties of individuals on joint estimation of evacuation\ndeparture and travel times. Survey data from Hurricane Sandy is used for\ncomputing empirical results. Results indicate significant role of social\nnetworks in addition to other key factors on evacuation departure and travel\ntimes during hurricanes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Nov 2018 23:50:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-27"}

Our approach operates on\ncandidate 3D keypoint correspondences, and contains two main steps: (1) a\ndeterministic selection scheme that significantly reduces the candidate\ncorrespondence set in a way that is guaranteed to preserve the optimal\nsolution; and (2) a fast branch-and-bound (BnB) algorithm with a novel\npolynomial-time subroutine for 1D rotation search, that quickly finds the\noptimal alignment for the reduced set. We demonstrate the practicality of our\nmethod on realistic point clouds from multiple LiDAR surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Nov 2018 06:36:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Nov 2018 01:45:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 30 Nov 2018 04:45:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-03"}

De-magnetised ions in the ion-inertial range of\nquasi-neutral plasmas respond to Kolmogorov (K) or Iroshnikov-Kraichnan (IK)\ninertial-range velocity turbulence power spectra via the spectrum of the\nvelocity-turbulence-related random-mean-square induction-electric field.\nMaintenance of electrical quasi-neutrality by the ions causes deformations in\nthe power spectral density of the turbulent density fluctuations.

Magnetic power spectra react passively to the density spectrum by\nwarranting pressure balance. This approach still neglects contribution of Hall\ncurrents and is restricted to the ion-inertial range scale. While both density\nand magnetic turbulence spectra in the affected range of ion-inertial scales\ndeviate from Kolmogorov or Iroshnikov-Kraichnan, the velocity turbulence\npreserves its inertial range shape in this process to which spectral advection\nturns out to be secondary but may become observable under special external\nconditions.

The teacher stream is represented by a complex\nCNN for high-accuracy recognition, and the student stream is represented by a\nmuch simpler CNN for low-complexity recognition. To avoid significant\nperformance drop at the student stream, we then selectively distil the most\ninformative facial features from the teacher stream by solving a sparse graph\noptimization problem, which are then used to regularize the fine-tuning process\nof the student stream. In this way, the student stream is actually trained by\nsimultaneously handling two tasks with limited computational resources:\napproximating the most informative facial cues via feature regression, and\nrecovering the missing facial cues via low-resolution face classification.\nExperimental results show that the student stream performs impressively in\nrecognizing low-resolution faces and costs only 0.15MB memory and runs at 418\nfaces per second on CPU and 9,433 faces per second on GPU.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Nov 2018 12:46:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 2019 01:43:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-14"}

One compelling concern, however, gradually\narise along with the rapidly growing performance scores over existing visual\nattention datasets: do existing deep models really capture the inherent\nmechanism of human visual attention? To address this concern, this paper\nproposes a new dataset, named VASUN, that records the free-viewing human\nattention on solar images. Different from previous datasets, images in VASUN\ncontain many irregular visual patterns that existing deep models have never\nseen. By benchmarking existing models on VASUN, we find the performances of\nmany state-of-the-art deep models drop remarkably, while many classic shallow\nmodels perform impressively. From these results, we find that the significant\nperformance advance of existing deep attention models may come from their\ncapabilities of memorizing and predicting the occurrence of some specific\nvisual patterns other than learning the inherent mechanism of human visual\nattention. In addition, we also train several baseline models on VASUN to\ndemonstrate the feasibility and key issues of predicting visual attention on\nthe sun.

Although many background\nsubtraction (BGS) methods have been proposed in the recent past, it is still\nregarded as a tough problem due to the variety of challenging situations that\noccur in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we explore this problem from a\nnew perspective and propose a novel background subtraction framework with\nreal-time semantic segmentation (RTSS). Our proposed framework consists of two\ncomponents, a traditional BGS segmenter $\\mathcal{B}$ and a real-time semantic\nsegmenter $\\mathcal{S}$. The BGS segmenter $\\mathcal{B}$ aims to construct\nbackground models and segments foreground objects. The real-time semantic\nsegmenter $\\mathcal{S}$ is used to refine the foreground segmentation outputs\nas feedbacks for improving the model updating accuracy. $\\mathcal{B}$ and\n$\\mathcal{S}$ work in parallel on two threads. For each input frame $I_t$, the\nBGS segmenter $\\mathcal{B}$ computes a preliminary foreground/background\n(FG/BG) mask $B_t$. At the same time, the real-time semantic segmenter\n$\\mathcal{S}$ extracts the object-level semantics ${S}_t$. Then, some specific\nrules are applied on ${B}_t$ and ${S}_t$ to generate the final detection\n${D}_t$. Finally, the refined FG/BG mask ${D}_t$ is fed back to update the\nbackground model. Comprehensive experiments evaluated on the CDnet 2014 dataset\ndemonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance\namong all unsupervised background subtraction methods while operating at\nreal-time, and even performs better than some deep learning based supervised\nalgorithms.

Believable crowds require the\neffort of storytellers and programming experts working together for long\nperiods of time. In this work, we present a new framework to allow users to\ngenerate populated environments in an easier and faster way, by relying on the\nuse of procedural techniques. Our framework consists of the procedural\ngeneration of semantically-augmented virtual cities to drive the procedural\ngeneration and simulation of crowds. The main novelty lies in the generation of\nagendas for each individual inhabitant (alone or as part of a family) by using\na rule-based grammar that combines city semantics with the autonomous persons'\ncharacteristics. Real-world data can be used to accommodate the generation of a\nvirtual population, thus enabling the recreation of more realistic scenarios.\nUsers can author a new population or city by editing rule files with the\nflexibility of re-using, combining or extending the rules of previous\npopulations. The results show how logical and consistent behaviors can be\neasily generated for a large crowd providing a good starting point to bring\nvirtual cities to life.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Nov 2018 15:33:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-27"}

When the target set of operations is intended\nto be the set of Clifford operators, the randomized benchmarking algorithm is\nparticularly easy to perform and its results have an important interpretation\nwith respect to quantum computation. The aim of the benchmark is to provide a\nsimple, useful parameter describing the quality of quantum control with an\nexperiment that can be performed in a standard way on any prospective quantum\ncomputer. This parameter can be used to fairly compare different experiments or\nto mark improvement in a single experiment.\n  In this thesis I discuss first the original randomized-benchmarking procedure\nand the importance of the Clifford operators for its implementation. I develop\nthe statistical analysis of the results and the physical assumptions that are\nrequired for the simplest analysis to apply. The original procedure does not\nextend in an obvious way to benchmarking of more than one qubit, so I introduce\na standardized procedure for randomized benchmarking that applies to any number\nof qubits.

Besides, we show that the spatial\nscaling parameters of the network, e.g., the density of clusters and distance\nbetween devices in the same cluster, play a crucial role in identifying the\ntradeoff between the content diversity gain and the cooperative transmission\ngain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Nov 2018 16:59:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-28"}

The search for more accurate and faster numerical integration\nmethods for the resolution of such systems is, therefore, an important topic of\nresearch. The present work introduces a new approach for the numerical\nintegration of dynamic systems. We propose an association of numerical\nintegration methods (integrators) in order to optimize the performance. The\nstandard we apply is the balance of the duo : precision obtained x running\ntime. The numerical integration methods we have chosen, for this particular\ninstance of association, were the Runge-Kutta of fourth order and seventheighth\norder. The algorithm was implemented in C++ language. The results showed an\nimprovement in accuracy over the lower grade numerical integrator (actually, we\nhave achieved, basically, the precision of the top integrator) with a\nprocessing time performance closer to the one of the lower grade integrator.\nSimilar results can be obtained for other pairs of numerical integration\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Nov 2018 14:05:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Apr 2019 00:06:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 13 May 2019 17:05:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-14"}

We fabricate\nand characterize 75 unique halide perovskite-inspired solution-based thin-film\nmaterials within a two-month period, with 87% exhibiting band gaps between 1.2\neV and 2.4 eV that are of interest for energy-harvesting applications. This\nincreased throughput is enabled by streamlining experimental workflows,\ndeveloping a set of precursors amenable to high-throughput synthesis, and\ndeveloping machine-learning assisted diagnosis. We utilize a deep neural\nnetwork to classify compounds based on experimental X-ray diffraction data into\n0D, 2D, and 3D structures more than 10 times faster than human analysis and\nwith 90% accuracy. We validate our methods using lead-halide perovskites and\nextend the application to novel lead-free compositions. The wider synthesis\nwindow and faster cycle of learning enables three noteworthy scientific\nfindings: (1) we realize four inorganic layered perovskites, A3B2Br9 (A = Cs,\nRb; B = Bi, Sb) in thin-film form via one-step liquid deposition; (2) we report\na multi-site lead-free alloy series that was not previously described in\nliterature, Cs3(Bi1-xSbx)2(I1-xBrx)9; and (3) we reveal the effect on bandgap\n(reduction to <2 eV) and structure upon simultaneous alloying on the B-site and\nX-site of Cs3Bi2I9 with Sb and Br. This study demonstrates that combining an\naccelerated experimental cycle of learning and machine-learning based diagnosis\nrepresents an important step toward realizing fully-automated laboratories for\nmaterials discovery and development.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Nov 2018 06:29:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-11"}

Typically, national household surveys that contain\nwelfare variables such as income and expenditures provide limited or no data\nfor small areas. It is well-known that while direct survey-weighted estimates\nare quite reliable for national or large geographical areas they are unreliable\nfor small geographic areas. If the objective is to find areas with extreme\npoverty, these direct estimates will often select small areas due to the high\nvariabilities in the estimates. Empirical best prediction and Bayesian methods\nhave been proposed to improve on the direct point estimates. However, these\nestimates are not appropriate for different inferential purposes. For example,\nfor identifying areas with extreme poverty, these estimates would often select\nareas with large sample sizes. In this paper, using databases used by the\nChilean Ministry for their Small Area Estimation production, we illustrate how\nappropriate Bayesian methodology can be developed to address different\ninferential problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Nov 2018 17:31:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-18"}

The phase modulation is converted to an\nintensity signal at the output of a Sagnac interferometer loop.

Oscillations at the frequencies of competing acoustic modes are\nsuppressed by at least 40 dB. The linewidth of the acoustic resonance is\nsufficiently narrow to provide oscillations at a single longitudinal mode of\nthe hybrid cavity.
