However, the intrinsically\nhigh carrier mobility of Ge becomes significantly degraded because Ge's native\noxide is unstable and readily decomposes into several GexOy suboxides with a\nhigh density of dangling bonds at the surface. In addition, these interface\ntrap states will also degrade the off-state leakage current and subthreshold\nturn-off of a Ge-based device, significantly affecting its stability.\nFurthermore, obtaining low-resistance Ohmic contacts to n-type Ge is another\nkey challenge in developing Ge CMOS. To solve these challenges, extensive\nefforts have been made about the incorporation of new materials, such as Al2O3,\nSiN3, TiO2, ZnO, Ge3N4, MgO, HfO2, SrTiO3, and Y2O3, into Ge transistors.\nControlling the diffusion of foreign atoms into Ge is therefore a critical\nissue in developing Ge transistors regarding that foreign impurities may be\ndetrimental to devices.

Cyber threat\nintelligence (CTI) is gaining attention as a way to collect meaningful\nknowledge to better understand the intention of an attacker and eventually\npredict future attacks. A systemic threat analysis based on data acquired from\nactual cyber incidents is a useful approach to generating intelligence for such\nan objective. Developing an analysis technique requires a high volume and fine\nquality data. However, researchers can become discouraged by an inaccessibility\nto data because organizations rarely release their data to the research\ncommunity.

The $Kepler$ data\nrevealed an excess emission in its early light curve, allowing to place\ninteresting constraints on its progenitor system (Dimitriadis et al. 2018,\nShappee et al. 2018b). Here, we present extensive optical, ultraviolet, and\nnear-infrared photometry, as well as dense sampling of optical spectra, for\nthis object. SN 2018oh is relatively normal in its photometric evolution, with\na rise time of 18.3$\\pm$0.3 days and $\\Delta$m$_{15}(B)=0.96\\pm$0.03 mag, but\nit seems to have bluer $B - V$ colors. We construct the \"uvoir\" bolometric\nlight curve having peak luminosity as 1.49$\\times$10$^{43}$erg s$^{-1}$, from\nwhich we derive a nickel mass as 0.55$\\pm$0.04M$_{\\odot}$ by fitting radiation\ndiffusion models powered by centrally located $^{56}$Ni. Note that the moment\nwhen nickel-powered luminosity starts to emerge is +3.85 days after the first\nlight in the Kepler data, suggesting other origins of the early-time emission,\ne.g., mixing of $^{56}$Ni to outer layers of the ejecta or interaction between\nthe ejecta and nearby circumstellar material or a non-degenerate companion\nstar. The spectral evolution of SN 2018oh is similar to that of a normal SN Ia,\nbut is characterized by prominent and persistent carbon absorption features.\nThe C II features can be detected from the early phases to about 3 weeks after\nthe maximum light, representing the latest detection of carbon ever recorded in\na SN Ia. This indicates that a considerable amount of unburned carbon exists in\nthe ejecta of SN 2018oh and may mix into deeper layers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Nov 2018 16:58:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-09"}

These data are supplemented by multi-color Pan-STARRS1 and\nCTIO 4-m DECam observations obtained within hours of explosion. The K2 light\ncurve has an unusual two-component shape, where the flux rises with a steep\nlinear gradient for the first few days, followed by a quadratic rise as seen\nfor typical SNe Ia. This \"flux excess\" relative to canonical SN Ia behavior is\nconfirmed in our $i$-band light curve, and furthermore, SN 2018oh is especially\nblue during the early epochs. The flux excess peaks 2.14$\\pm0.04$ days after\nexplosion, has a FWHM of 3.12$\\pm0.04$ days, a blackbody temperature of\n$T=17,500^{+11,500}_{-9,000}$ K, a peak luminosity of\n$4.3\\pm0.2\\times10^{37}\\,{\\rm erg\\,s^{-1}}$, and a total integrated energy of\n$1.27\\pm0.01\\times10^{43}\\,{\\rm erg}$.

The sequential burner\n(SB) features a mixing section with fuel injection into a hot vitiated\ncrossflow. Depending on the dominant combustion mode, a recirculation zone\nassists flame anchoring in the combustion chamber. The flame is located\nsufficiently downstream of the injector resulting in partially premixed\nconditions. First, combustion regime maps are obtained from 0-D and 1-D\nsimulations showing the co-existence of three combustion modes: autoignition,\nflame propagation and flame propagation assisted by autoignition. These regime\nmaps can be used to understand the combustion modes at play in turbulent\nsequential combustors, as shown with 3-D large eddy simulations (LES) with\nsemi-detailed chemistry. In addition to the simulation of steady-state\ncombustion at three different operating conditions, transient simulations are\nperformed: (i) ignition of the combustor with autoignition as the dominant\nmode, (ii) ignition that is initiated by autoignition and that is followed by a\ntransition to a propagation stabilized flame, and (iii) a transient change of\nthe inlet temperature (decrease by 150 K) resulting into a change of the\ncombustion regime. These results show the importance of the recirculation zone\nfor the ignition and the anchoring of a propagating type flame. On the\ncontrary, the autoignition flame stabilizes due to continuous self-ignition of\nthe mixture and the recirculation zone does not play an important role for the\nflame anchoring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Nov 2018 17:55:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-27"}

While SGLD with\ndecreasing step sizes converges weakly to the posterior distribution, the\nalgorithm is often used with a constant step size in practice and has\ndemonstrated successes in machine learning tasks. The current practice is to\nset the step size inversely proportional to $N$ where $N$ is the number of\ntraining samples. As $N$ becomes large, we show that the SGLD algorithm has an\ninvariant probability measure which significantly departs from the target\nposterior and behaves like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). This difference\nis inherently due to the high variance of the stochastic gradients. Several\nstrategies have been suggested to reduce this effect; among them, SGLD Fixed\nPoint (SGLDFP) uses carefully designed control variates to reduce the variance\nof the stochastic gradients.

We attempt an answer by looking at the problem through the lens of a\nregulator whose mandate is to maximize the cumulative welfare of ISPs, CPs, and\nconsumers.\n  Specifically, we consider a two-sided market model, in which a local monopoly\nISP prices Internet access to consumers and possibly to CPs as well.

The objective function and constraints consist of multiple terms\ndesigned for different clinical and practical considerations. Weighting factors\nof these terms are needed to define the optimization problem. While a treatment\nplanning system can solve the optimization problem with given weights,\nadjusting the weights for high plan quality is performed by human. The weight\ntuning task is labor intensive, time consuming, and it critically affects the\nfinal plan quality. An automatic weight-tuning approach is strongly desired.\nThe weight tuning procedure is essentially a decision making problem. Motivated\nby the tremendous success in deep learning for decision making with human-level\nintelligence, we propose a novel framework to tune the weights in a human-like\nmanner. Using treatment planning in high-dose-rate brachytherapy as an example,\nwe develop a weight tuning policy network (WTPN) that observes dose volume\nhistograms of a plan and outputs an action to adjust organ weights, similar to\nthe behaviors of a human planner. We train the WTPN via end-to-end deep\nreinforcement learning. Experience replay is performed with the epsilon greedy\nalgorithm. Then we apply the trained WTPN to guide treatment planning of\ntesting patient cases. The trained WTPN successfully learns the treatment\nplanning goals to guide the weight tuning process. On average, the quality\nscore of plans generated under the WTPN's guidance is improved by ~8.5%\ncompared to the initial plan with arbitrary weights, and by 10.7% compared to\nthe plans generated by human planners. To our knowledge, this is the first tool\nto adjust weights for the treatment planning in a human-like fashion based on\nlearnt intelligence.

If the kernel of L_X on p-forms has\ndimension b_p(X), then the general Euler-Poincare formula holds for every\nparameter field X. Extreme cases are i_X=d^*, where b_k are the usual Betti\nnumbers and X=0, where b_k=f_k(G) are the components of the f-vector of the\nsimplicial complex G. We also note that the McKean-Singer super-symmetry\nextends from L to Lie derivatives. It also holds for L_X on Riemannian\nmanifolds. the non-zero spectrum of L_X on even forms is the same than the\nnon-zero spectrum of L_X on odd forms. We also can deform with D_X' = [B_X,D_X]\nof D_X=d+i_X + b_X, B_X=d_X-d_X^*+i b_X the exterior derivative d governed by\nthe vector field X.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Nov 2018 00:27:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-27"}

Amazingly, behavioral and neurophysiological\nevidence suggests that humans and some insects can be trained to distinguish\nisotopologue molecules which are related by the substitution of isotopes for\ncertain atoms, such as a hydrogen-to-deuterium substitution. How is it possible\nto smell a neutron? The physics of olfaction may explain this isotopomer\neffect. Inelastic electron transfer spectroscopy (IETS) has been proposed as a\ncandidate mechanism for such subtle olfactory effects: the vibrational spectrum\nof an appropriately-quantized odorant molecule may enhance a transfer rate in a\ndiscriminating electron transfer (ET) process. In contrast to other\nsemi-classical or quantum-master-equation-based models of olfactory IETS, the\nmodel presented here explicitly treats the dynamics of a dominant odorant\nvibrational mode, which provides an indirect dissipative path from the electron\nto the thermal environment. A direct dissipative path to the environment also\nis included. Within this model, a calculation of ET rate is developed, along\nwith a calculation of power dissipation to the thermal environment. Under very\nweak direct dissipative coupling, spectroscopic behaviors of the indirect path\nare revealed, and the resulting ET rate exhibits resonant peaks at certain\nodorant frequencies. Resonant peaks in ET rate also correlate to peaks in power\ndissipation. Spectroscopic behaviors are masked by strong direct dissipative\ncoupling. Results support a rate-based discrimination between a preferred\nligand and an isotopomer if indirect dissipative coupling dominates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Nov 2018 00:33:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 2 Mar 2019 05:17:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-01"}

The structure and evolution of solar filaments are\nimportant for our understanding of solar atmosphere physics. In this work, we\ninvestigate a giant dark channel crossing the solar equator, which consists of\ntwo filament channels with different chiralities. From 2016 April 22 to April\n27, this giant dark channel occupied the solar disk. Within this giant channel,\na filament channel with dextral chirality was detected in the northern\nhemisphere, and another filament channel with sinistral chirality was observed\nin the southern hemisphere. At the junction of the two filament channels, a\ncusp structure was observed associated with active region (AR) 12532 near the\nsolar equator. The extrapolated three-dimensional magnetic fields reveal that\nthis cusp structure was composed of two sets of field lines belonging to two\ndifferent filament channels and was rooted on the AR positive-polarity fields.\nIn addition, dark material flows from filaments in the two channels to the cusp\nstructure were detected as well as the flux emergence and cancellation around\nthe cusp footpoints. On 2016 May 21, after a solar rotation, the cusp structure\nhad disappeared, and the giant dark channel broke in the middle where another\nAR, 12546, had emerged completely. We propose that the magnetic flux emergence\nand cancellation around the cusp region resulted in the disappearance of the\ncusp structure and the break of the giant dark channel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Nov 2018 02:34:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

By contrast, the latter\nreflects users' purchasing inclination in a relatively short period. They both\naffect users' current purchasing intentions. However, few research efforts have\nbeen dedicated to jointly model them for the personalized product search. To\nthis end, we propose a novel Attentive Long Short-Term Preference model, dubbed\nas ALSTP, for personalized product search.

More specifically, the\ncombination of the temporal, spectral and spatial resolutions of new SITS makes\npossible to monitor vegetation dynamics. Although traditional classification\nalgorithms, such as Random Forest (RF), have been successfully applied for SITS\nclassification, these algorithms do not make the most of the temporal domain.\nConversely, some approaches that take into account the temporal dimension have\nrecently been tested, especially Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). This paper\nproposes an exhaustive study of another deep learning approaches, namely\nTemporal Convolutional Neural Networks (TempCNNs) where convolutions are\napplied in the temporal dimension. The goal is to quantitatively and\nqualitatively evaluate the contribution of TempCNNs for SITS classification.\nThis paper proposes a set of experiments performed on one million time series\nextracted from 46 Formosat-2 images. The experimental results show that\nTempCNNs are more accurate than RF and RNNs, that are the current state of the\nart for SITS classification.

Refactoring is considered as a method for enhancing the\ninternal structure of code for improving many software properties such as\nmaintainability.\n  In this thesis, the subject of refactoring software packages using community\ndetection algorithms is discussed, with a focus on the notion of package\nstability. The proposed algorithm starts by extracting a package dependency\nnetwork from Java byte code and a community detection algorithm is used to find\npossible changes in package structures. In this work, the reasons for the\nimportance of considering dependency directions while modeling package\ndependencies with graphs are also discussed, and a proof for the relationship\nbetween package stability and the modularity of package dependency graphs is\npresented that shows how modularity is in favor of package stability.\n  For evaluating the proposed algorithm, a tool for live analysis of software\npackages is implemented, and two software systems are tested. Results show that\nmodeling package dependencies with directed graphs and applying the presented\nrefactoring method, leads to a higher increase in package stability than\nundirected graph modeling approaches that have been studied in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Nov 2018 04:05:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-27"}

It has been argued that\nmetabolite secretion creates new niches and facilitates such diversity.\nNonetheless, it is still a controversial topic why cells secrete even essential\nmetabolites so often; in fact, even under isolation conditions, microbial cells\nsecrete various metabolites, including those essential for their growth. First,\nwe demonstrate that leaking essential metabolites can be advantageous. If the\nintracellular chemical reactions include multibody reactions like catalytic\nreactions, this advantageous leakage of essential metabolites is possible and\nindeed typical for most metabolic networks via \"flux control\" and\n\"growth-dilution\" mechanisms; the later is a result of the balance between\nsynthesis and growth-induced dilution with autocatalytic reactions.\nCounterintuitively, the mechanisms can work even when the supplied resource is\nscarce. Next, when such cells are crowded, the presence of another cell type,\nwhich consumes the leaked chemicals is beneficial for both cell types, so that\ntheir coexistence enhances the growth of both. The latter part of the paper is\ndevoted to the analysis of such unusual form of symbiosis: \"consumer\" cell\ntypes benefit from the uptake of metabolites secreted by \"leaker\" cell types,\nand such consumption reduces the concentration of metabolites accumulated in\nthe environment; this environmental change enables further secretion from the\nleaker cell types.

Most of the traditional human body registration methods require manual\nassistance, or other auxiliary information such as texture and markers.

Following the introduction of the low-quality scans from\ncost-effective devices such as Kinect, the 3D data capturing of human body\nbecomes more convenient and easier. However, due to the inevitable holes,\nnoises and outliers in the low-quality scan, the registration of human body\nbecomes even more challenging.

A widely used approach for sampling posterior\ndistribution is based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). However, the samples\ngenerated by MCMC are usually strongly correlated. This may lead to a small\nsize of effective samples from a long Markov chain and the resultant posterior\nestimate may be inaccurate. An implicit sampling method proposed in [11] can\ngenerate independent samples and capture some inherent non-Gaussian features of\nthe posterior based on the weights of samples. In the implicit sampling method,\nthe posterior samples are generated by constructing a map and distribute around\nthe MAP point. However, the weights of implicit sampling in previous works may\ncause excessive concentration of samples and lead to ensemble collapse. To\novercome this issue, we propose a new weight formulation and make resampling\nbased on the new weights. In practice, some parameters in prior density are\noften unknown and a hierarchical Bayesian inference is necessary for posterior\nexploration. To this end, the hierarchical Bayesian formulation is used to\nestimate the MAP point and integrated in the implicit sampling framework.\nCompared to conventional implicit sampling, the proposed implicit sampling\nmethod can significantly improve the posterior estimator and the applicability\nfor high dimensional inverse problems. The improved implicit sampling method is\napplied to the Bayesian inverse problems of multi-term time fractional\ndiffusion models in heterogeneous media. To effectively capture the\nheterogeneity effect, we present a mixed generalized multiscale finite element\nmethod (mixed GMsFEM) to solve the time fractional diffusion models in a coarse\ngrid, which can substantially speed up the Bayesian inversion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Nov 2018 06:05:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-27"}

The PG phase is found by the\nangle-resolved photoemission spectra(ARPES) to have a gap at some regions in\nmomentum space and a fraction of Fermi surface remained, known as Fermi arcs.\nThe arc turns into a d-wave SC gap with a node below the SC transition\ntemperature. Here, by studying a strongly correlated model at low temperatures,\nwe obtained a phase characterized by two kinds of pairing order parameters with\nthe total momentum of the Cooper pair to be zero and finite. The finite\nmomentum pairing is accompanied with a spatial modulation of pairing order,\ni.e. a pair density wave (PDW). These PDW phases are intertwined with\nmodulations of charge density and intra-unit cell form factors. The coexistence\nof the two different pairing orders provides the unique two-gaps like spectra\nobserved by ARPES for superconducting cuprates. As temperature raises, the zero\nmomentum pairing order vanishes while the finite momentum pairing orders are\nkept, thus Fermi arcs are realized. The calculated quasiparticle spectra has\nthe similar doping and temperature dependence as reported by ARPES and scanning\ntunneling spectroscopy(STS). The consequence of breaking symmetry between x and\ny due to the unidirectional PDW and the possibility to probe such a PDW state\nin the PG phase is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Nov 2018 06:10:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-13"}

However, conventional solution approaches\noften rely on accurate estimates of uncertainty distributions, which may not\nexist. When the distributions are not known but can be limited to a set of\nplausible distributions, termed an ambiguity set, distributionally robust (DR)\noptimization can be used to ensure that chance constraints hold for all\ndistributions in that set. However, DR OPF yields conservative solutions if the\nambiguity set is too large. In this paper, we assess the value of using both\nmoment and unimodality information, which shrinks the ambiguity set and reduces\nconservatism, in DR OPF problems. Most practical uncertainty distributions in\npower systems are unimodal. Exact reformulations, approximations, and efficient\nsolving techniques were developed in a previous paper.

Using their stacked $gri$ images, we determined geometrical parameters\nof these galaxies (the position angle and the size of the host galaxy and the\nring). We compare our sample objects to the previously known PRGs and discuss\ntheir general characteristics (the frequency of faint outer structures, the\nluminosity--size relation, and the distribution by the apparent angle between\nthe ring and the host galaxy). Our main results are: (i) Central galaxies of\nPRGs follow the luminosity--size relation for ordinary galaxies. The ring\ncomponents are located along the similar relation but with a larger scatter.\nThis increasing scatter may be the result of a secondary origin of polar\nstructures.

Mendelian randomization (MR), an\ninstrumental variable (IV) method, has been introduced for causal inference\nusing GWAS data. Due to the polygenic architecture of complex traits/diseases\nand the ubiquity of pleiotropy, however, MR has many unique challenges compared\nto conventional IV methods. We propose a Bayesian weighted Mendelian\nrandomization (BWMR) for causal inference to address these challenges. In our\nBWMR model, the uncertainty of weak effects owing to polygenicity has been\ntaken into account and the violation of IV assumption due to pleiotropy has\nbeen addressed through outlier detection by Bayesian weighting. To make the\ncausal inference based on BWMR computationally stable and efficient, we\ndeveloped a variational expectation-maximization (VEM) algorithm. Moreover, we\nhave also derived an exact closed-form formula to correct the posterior\ncovariance which is often underestimated in variational inference. Through\ncomprehensive simulation studies, we evaluated the performance of BWMR,\ndemonstrating the advantage of BWMR over its competitors. Then we applied BWMR\nto make causal inference between 130 metabolites and 93 complex human traits,\nuncovering novel causal relationship between exposure and outcome traits.

Core separations vary\nbetween sub-100au to several 100 and 1000au. The core separations and\napproximate masses are largely consistent with thermal Jeans fragmentation of a\ndense gas core. Due to the high continuum optical depth, most spectral lines\nare seen in absorption. However, a few exceptional emission lines are found\nthat most likely stem from transitions with excitation conditions above1000K.\nToward the main continuum source, these emission lines exhibit a velocity\ngradient across scales of 100-200au aligned with the molecular outflow and\nperpendicular to the previously inferred disk orientation. While we cannot\nexclude that these observational features stem from an inner hot accretion\ndisk, the alignment with the outflow rather suggests that it stems from the\ninner jet and outflow region. The highest-velocity features are found toward\nthe peak position, and no Hubble-like velocity structure can be identified.\nTherefore, these data are consistent with steady-state turbulent entrainment of\nthe hot molecular gas via Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities at the interface\nbetween the jet and the outflow.\n  Conclusions: Resolving this high-mass star-forming region at sub-50au scales\nindicates that the hierarchical fragmentation process in the framework of\nthermal Jeans fragmentation can continue down to the smallest accessible\nspatial scales. Velocity gradients on these small scales have to be treated\ncautiously and do not necessarily stem from disks, but may be better explained\nwith outflow emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Nov 2018 09:34:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-16"}

To alleviate these problems, a Population-guided\nNovelty Search (PNS) parallel learning method is proposed in this paper. In\nPNS, the population is divided into multiple sub-populations, each of which has\none chief agent and several exploring agents. The chief agent evaluates the\npolicies learned by exploring agents and shares the optimal policy with all\nsub-populations. The exploring agents learn their policies in collaboration\nwith the guidance of the optimal policy and, simultaneously, upload their\npolicies to the chief agent. To balance exploration and exploitation, the\nNovelty Search (NS) is employed in every chief agent to encourage policies with\nhigh novelty while maximizing per-episode performance. We apply PNS to the twin\ndelayed deep deterministic (TD3) policy gradient algorithm.

This\nvision challenges our capability to build complex open trustworthy autonomous\nsystems. We lack a rigorous common semantic framework for autonomous systems.\nIt is remarkable that the debate about autonomous vehicles focuses almost\nexclusively on AI and learning techniques while it ignores many other equally\nimportant autonomous system design issues. Autonomous systems involve agents\nand objects coordinated in some common environment so that their collective\nbehavior meets a set of global goals. We propose a general computational model\ncombining a system architecture model and an agent model. The architecture\nmodel allows expression of dynamic reconfigurable multi-mode coordination\nbetween components. The agent model consists of five interacting modules\nimplementing each one a characteristic function: Perception, Reflection, Goal\nmanagement, Planning and Self-adaptation. It determines a concept of autonomic\ncomplexity accounting for the specific difficulty to build autonomous systems.\nWe emphasize that the main characteristic of autonomous systems is their\nability to handle knowledge and adaptively respond to environment changes. We\nadvocate that autonomy should be associated with functionality and not with\nspecific techniques. Machine learning is essential for autonomy although it can\nmeet only a small portion of the needs implied by autonomous system design. We\nconclude that autonomy is a kind of broad intelligence. Building trustworthy\nand optimal autonomous systems goes far beyond the AI challenge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Nov 2018 10:36:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-27"}

The goal is to describe the changes between the measurements of the\nlight performed by a sample of observers slightly displaced with respect to\neach other and moving with different 4-velocities and 4-accelerations. In our\napproach, all results of observations can be expressed as functions of the\nkinematic variables, describing the motions of the observers and the emitting\nbodies with respect to their local inertial frames, and four linear bilocal\ngeodesic operators, describing the influence of the spacetime geometry on light\npropagation. The operators are functionals of the curvature tensor along the\nline of sight. The results are based on the assumption that the regions of\nemissions and observations are sufficiently small so that the spacetime\ncurvature effects are negligible within each of them, although they are\nsignificant for the light propagation between them. The new formulation\nprovides a uniform approach to optical phenomena in curved spacetimes and, as\nan application, we discuss the problem of a fully relativistic definition of\nthe parallax and position drifts (or proper motions). We then use the results\nto construct combinations of observables which are completely insensitive to\nthe motion of both the observer and the emitter. These combinations by\nconstruction probe the spacetime geometry between the observation and emission\nregions and in our formalism we may express them as functionals of the Riemann\ntensor along the line of sight. For short distances one of these combinations\ndepends only on the matter content along the line of sight.

The interaction of CRs and Galactic magnetic fields produces\nsynchrotron radiation clearly visible in the radio regime. Detailed\nmeasurements of synchrotron radiation averaged over the line-of-sight (LOS),\nso-called synchrotron emissivities, can be used as a tracer of the CR density\nand Galactic magnetic field (GMF) strength. Our aim is to model the synchrotron\nemissivity in the Milky Way using a 3 dimensional dataset instead of\nLOS-integrated intensity maps on the sky. Using absorbed HII regions we can\nmeasure the synchrotron emissivity over a part of the LOS through the Galaxy,\nchanging from a 2 dimensional to a 3 dimensional view. Performing these\nmeasurements on a large scale is one of the new applications of the window\nopened by current low frequency arrays.

Coupling between Anderson-Bogoliubov superfluid phonon (AB phonon)\nin superfluid neutron gas and collective excitations of nuclear clusters is a\nkey issue. Purpose: We intend to predict the nature of low-lying excitation\nmodes of superfluid inner crust matter with focus on quadrupole excitations\naround a spherical nuclear cluster. We study how the AB phonon of neutron\nsuperfluid and possible quadrupole shape vibration of clusters are affected by\nthe inhomogeneous structure of inner crust matter. Results: The calculated\nresults indicate emergence of both AB phonon and quadrupole shape vibration of\nthe cluster with small mixing between the two collective modes. The quadruple\nAB phonon is similar to that in uniform superfluid apart from small admixture\nof the shape vibration of cluster. The excitation energy and the collectivity\nof the cluster vibration mode shows strong and oscillatory dependence on the\nneutron chemical potential (the neutron gas density), leading to softening and\ninstability in certain situations. This is caused by the resonance shell effect\nwhere unbound but resonant single-particle states of neutrons play a central\nrole. Conclusions: The AB phonon of superfluid neutron gas and the quadrupole\nshape vibration of nuclear cluster coexist in inner crust. The coupling between\nthe AB phonon and the quadrupole shape vibration is weak. The collectivity of\nthe quadrupole shape vibration is governed by the resonance shell effect, and\nit suggests that emergence of deformed nuclear clusters is possible at any\nlayer of inner crust.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Nov 2018 12:11:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-24"}

However, this process may harm protected (minority) classes if the\nclustering algorithm does not adequately represent them in desirable clusters\n-- especially if the data is already biased.\n  At NIPS 2017, Chierichetti et al. proposed a model for fair clustering\nrequiring the representation in each cluster to (approximately) preserve the\nglobal fraction of each protected class. Restricting to two protected classes,\nthey developed both a 4-approximation for the fair $k$-center problem and a\n$O(t)$-approximation for the fair $k$-median problem, where $t$ is a parameter\nfor the fairness model. For multiple protected classes, the best known result\nis a 14-approximation for fair $k$-center.\n  We extend and improve the known results.

Among these three\ntypes, Type A and B TBLs are investigated in terms of its universal statistical\nlaws of velocity and temperature with independency on both Reynolds (Re) and\nPrandtl (Pr) numbers. With reference to the analysis by von Karman in\ndeveloping the conventional law of the wall for Type A TBL, the current study\nfirst physically distinguishes the time averaged local velocity scale from the\nensemble averaged velocity scale, and properly defines the TBL temperature\nscale based on wall heat flux, similar to the well known frictional velocity\nscale based on wall shear stress. The unified law of the wall formulations are\nthen derived for the inner layer of Type A and B thermal TBLs using these\nscales. The formulations are constructed by introducing the general damping and\nenhancing functions in inner layer, and further, these functions are extended\nto logarithmic coordinate based on the multiscale characteristics of TBL\nvelocity profiles. The validations of the law are conducted both by the DNS\nguided near wall integration of Type B TBL governing equations, which uncovered\nthe Re and Pr independency mechanisms of the law.

LC clustering is a widely used analytic\ntechnology, which discovers electricity consumption patterns by grouping\nsimilar LCs into same sub-groups. However, previous clustering methods treat\neach LC in the data set as an individual time series, ignoring the inherent\nrelationship among different LCs, restraining the performance of the clustering\nmethods. What's more, due to the significant volatility and uncertainty of LCs,\nthe previous LC clustering approaches inevitably result in either lager number\nof clusters or huge variances within a cluster, which is unacceptable for\nactual application needs. In this paper, we proposed an integrated approach to\naddress this issue. First, we converted the LC clustering task into the\ncommunity detection task in network. Second, we proposed a clustering approach\nincorporated with community detection to improve the performance of LC\nclustering, which includes network construction, community detection and\ntypical load profile extraction. The method convert the data set into a network\nin which the inherent relationship among LCs is represented by the edges of the\nnetwork.

Mr. DLib generates recommendations for research articles but in\nthe future, recommendations may include call for papers, grants, etc. Operators\nof academic products can request recommendations from Mr. DLib and display\nthese recommendations to their users. Mr. DLib can be integrated in just a few\nhours or days; creating an equivalent recommender system from scratch would\nrequire several months for an academic operator. Mr. DLib has been used by\nGESIS Sowiport and by the reference manager JabRef. Mr. DLib is open source and\nits goal is to facilitate the application of, and research on, scientific\nrecommender systems. In this paper, we present the motivation for Mr. DLib, the\narchitecture and details about the effectiveness.

At one-loop\nquantum level, the duality dictionary for partition functions entails an\nequality between the functional determinants of the corresponding kinetic\noperators and, in particular, it provides a holographic route to their Weyl\nanomalies. The heat kernel of a single bulk massive scalar field encodes the\nWeyl anomaly (type-A and type-B) coefficients for the whole tower of GJMS\noperators whenever they exist, as in the case of Einstein manifolds where they\nfactorize into product of Laplacians.

Current\nmethods of producing efficacy probability maps follow an anatomical guidance on\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to identify the areas with the highest\nefficacy in a population.

The devised technique, called Hot-Cold, is able to\nensure proximity maintenance by the tracking robotic device solely based on the\nstrength of the RF signal broadcasted by the target to communicate its sensors'\ndata. Complete geometrical, numerical, simulation, and convergence analyses of\nthe proposed technique are thoroughly presented, along with a detailed\nsimulation-based evaluation that reveals the higher following accuracy of\nHot-Cold compared to the popular concept of trilateration-based tracking.\nFinally, a prototype of the full architecture was implemented not only to\ndemonstrate the applicability of the presented approach for monitoring in\ndynamic environments, but also the operability of the introduced tracking\ntechnique.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Nov 2018 15:05:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 May 2020 11:29:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-12"}

The aim of this work is to develop a non-deterministic inference\nframework, including theory, approximation and sampling method, that deals with\nthe inverse problems in which uncertainty is represented using random sets. The\nproposed inference method yields the posterior random set based on the\nintersection of the prior and the measurement induced random sets.

In\nthis paper we present a framework for combining -omics data sets, and for\nhandling high dimensional data, making -omics research more accessible to\nmachine learning applications. We demonstrate the success of this framework\nthrough integration and analysis of multi-analyte data for a set of 3,533\nbreast cancers. We then use this data-set to predict breast cancer patient\nsurvival for individuals at risk of an impending event, with higher accuracy\nand lower variance than methods trained on individual data-sets. We hope that\nour pipelines for data-set generation and transformation will open up -omics\ndata to machine learning researchers.

The proposed in-pixel\nchopping technique is used to reduce the low-frequency or 1/f noise of the\nsource follower (SF) in an active pixel sensor (APS), which is a major\ncomponent of the temporal noise. A conventional 3T active pixel, with\nn-well/p-sub photodiode (PD), is modified to implement a chopper inside a\npixel. A single minimum sized nMOS transistor is used in each pixel, without\nmuch compromising in the fill-factor (FF). Using chopping action the\nlow-frequency noise of the source follower is modulated to the chopping\nfrequency (f ch ) which is much higher than the maximum frequency of the input\nsignal frequency band. The up-converted low-frequency noise is eliminated using\na column level low-pass filter (LPF), in the later stage. The reduction in the\ntemporal noise also results in an enhanced dynamic range of the image sensor.\nIn addition, the readout consists of a column level high gain chopper amplifier\nalso reduces the non-linearity of the source follower. To validate the proposed\ntechnique a prototype sensor consists of a 128x128 sized pixel array with\nin-pixel chopping and column level read-out circuitry, is fabricated in AMS\n0.35 {\\mu}m CMOS OPTO process. The pixel pitch is 10.5 um (horizontal and\nvertical both) with a fill-factor of around 30%. The temporal noise is measured\nas 280 uVrms at the chopping frequency (fch) of 8 MHz, which shows a reduction\nin the noise power by 11 dB. Due to the reduced noise floor, the dynamic range\nis enhanced from 65 dB to 76 dB, using the proposed technique.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Nov 2018 04:45:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-28"}

However, modelling animal trajectories\nand social interactions in simple bounded environments remains a challenge.\nMoreover, advances in the understanding of the sensory-motor loop and the\ninformation processing by animals are leading to revisions of the traditional\nassumptions made in decision-making algorithms. In this context, we develop a\nmethodology based on artificial neural networks (ANN) to describe the\ncollective motion of small zebrafish groups in a bounded environment. Although\nANN models are commonly used in artificial systems they are still\nunder-explored to model animal collective behaviours. Here, we present a\nmethodology to calibrate Multilayer Perceptrons by learning from real fish\nexperimental data. The ANNs are trained using either supervised learning or\nvarious forms of evolutionary reinforcement learning methods (using the CMA-ES\nand NSGA-III algorithms). We reveal that ANN models trained using evolutionary\nmethods are capable of generating realistic collective motions for groups of 5\nzebrafish including the tank wall effects, a feature that is lacking in\nprevious models. Finally, we also discuss the benefits of optimised ANNs as\ncandidates for driving robotic lure with biologically realistic behaviour, a\nmethod that is becoming increasingly popular to gather data and validate\nassumptions on collective behaviours.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Nov 2018 15:31:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-28"}

To support assurance that the system satisfies its\nrequirements, it is desirable that continuous verification can be performed\nafter each refinement or revision step. To achieve practical adoption, formal\nsystem modeling and verification must accommodate continuous verification\nefficiently and effectively. Our proposal to address this problem is TOrPEDO, a\nverification approach where models are given via Partial Kripke Structures\n(PKSs) and requirements are specified as Linear-time Temporal Logic (LTL)\nproperties. PKSs support refinement, by deliberately indicating unspecified\nparts of the model that are later completed. We support verification in two\ncomplementary forms: via model checking and proofs. Model checking is useful to\nprovide counterexamples, i.e., pinpoint model behaviors that violate\nrequirements. Proofs are instead useful since they can explain why requirements\nare satisfied. In our work, we introduce a specific concept of proof, called\ntopological proof (TP). A TP produces a slice of the original PKS which\njustifies the property satisfaction. Because models can be incomplete, TOrPEDO\nsupports reasoning on requirements satisfaction, violation, and possible\nsatisfaction (in the case where the satisfaction depends on unknown parts).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Nov 2018 13:27:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-28"}

For medical diagnosis, machine learning is a useful tool, however\nfeatures and algorithms must be carefully selected to get accurate\nclassification. To this effect, three feature selection methods have been used\non 13 input features from the Cleveland dataset with 297 entries, and 7 were\nselected. The selected features were used to train three different classifiers,\nwhich are SVM, Na\\\"ive Bayes and KNN using 10-fold cross-validation. The\nresulting models evaluated using Accuracy, Recall, Specificity and Precision.\nIt is found that the Na\\\"ive Bayes classifier performs the best on this dataset\nand features, outperforming or matching SVM and KNN in all the four evaluation\nparameters used and achieving an accuracy of 84%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Nov 2018 12:14:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-10"}

It estimates the user's\nfloor and her 2D location on that floor. Hapi is calibration-free, only\nrequiring the building's floorplans and its WiFi APs' installation location for\ndeployment. Our analysis shows that while a user can hear APs from nearby\nfloors as well as her floor, she will typically only receive signals from\nspatially closer APs in distant floors, as compared to APs in her floor. This\nis due to signal attenuation by floors/ceilings along with the 3D distance\nbetween the APs and the user. Hapi leverages this observation to achieve\naccurate and robust location estimates. A deep-learning based method is\nproposed to identify the user's floor. Then, the identified floor along with\nthe user's visible APs from all floors are used to estimate her 2D location\nthrough a novel RSS-Rank Gaussian-based method. Additionally, we present a\nregression based method to predict Hapi's location estimates' quality and\nemploy it within a Kalman Filter to further refine the accuracy. Our evaluation\nresults, from deployment on various android devices over 6 months with 13\nsubjects in 5 different up to 9 floors multistory buildings, show that Hapi can\nidentify the user's exact floor up to 95.2% of the time and her 2D location\nwith a median accuracy of 3.5m, achieving 52.1% and 76.0% improvement over\nrelated calibration-free state-of-the-art systems respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Nov 2018 23:46:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-10"}
