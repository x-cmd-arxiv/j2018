We propose two extensions to the basic RN model for\nnatural language. First, building on the intuition that not all word pairs are\nequally informative about the meaning of a sentence, we use constraints based\non both supervised and unsupervised dependency syntax to control which\nrelations influence the representation. Second, since higher-order relations\nare poorly captured by a sum of pairwise relations, we use a recurrent\nextension of RNs to propagate information so as to form representations of\nhigher order relations.

Strikingly, it can predict short-range epistasis but fails to capture\nlong-range epistasis, in consistence with empirical findings.

In order to clarify the\nobserved discrepancy, the specific differences between these models are\nisolated analytically in this study and are related to physical gust\nparameters. Gusts with these parameters are then produced in wind-tunnel\nexperiments using an active-grid gust generator. Measurements of the unsteady\ngust loads on an airfoil in the wind tunnel at Reynolds numbers ($Re_c$) of\n$2.0\\times 10^5$ and $2.6\\times 10^5$ and reduced frequencies between 0.09 and\n0.42 confirm that the decisive difference between the Sears and Atassi\nfunctions lies in the character of the gust and not in the characteristics of\nthe airfoil.

Identifying predictive\ncovariates, which influence the treatment effect and can be used to define\nsubgroups of patients, is a key aspect of this task. Analyses of treatment\neffect heterogeneity are however known to be challenging, since the number of\npossible covariates or subgroups is often large, while samples sizes in earlier\nphases of drug development are often small. In addition, distinguishing\npredictive covariates from prognostic covariates, which influence the response\nindependent of the given treatment, can often be difficult. While many\napproaches for these types of problems have been proposed, most of them focus\non the two-arm clinical trial setting, where patients are given either the\ntreatment or a control. In this paper we consider parallel groups dose-finding\ntrials, in which patients are administered different doses of the same\ntreatment. To investigate treatment effect heterogeneity in this setting we\npropose a Bayesian hierarchical dose-response model with covariate effects on\ndose-response parameters. We make use of shrinkage priors to prevent\noverfitting, which can easily occur, when the number of considered covariates\nis large and sample sizes are small. We compare several such priors in\nsimulations and also investigate dependent modeling of prognostic and\npredictive effects to better distinguish these two types of effects.

This steady state is given by\na tractable expression that allows for an intuitive interpretation in terms of\nspin-flip rates.

Because of its nature as a long-distance biometric trait,\ngait can be easily collected and used to identify individuals non-intrusively\nthrough CCTV cameras. However, it is very difficult to develop robust automated\ngait recognition systems, since gait may be affected by many covariate factors\nsuch as clothing, walking speed, camera view angle etc. Out of them, large view\nangle changes has been deemed as the most challenging factor as it can alter\nthe overall gait appearance substantially.\n  Existing works on gait recognition are far from enough to provide satisfying\nperformances because of such view changes. Furthermore, very few works have\nconsidered evidences -- the demonstrable information revealing the\nreliabilities of decisions, which are regarded as important demands in machine\nlearning-based recognition/authentication applications. To address these\nissues, in this paper we propose a Discriminant Gait Generative Adversarial\nNetwork, namely DiGGAN, which can effectively extract view-invariant features\nfor cross-view gait recognition; and more importantly, to transfer gait images\nto different views -- serving as evidences and showing how the decisions have\nbeen made. Quantitative experiments have been conducted on the two most popular\ncross-view gait datasets, the OU-MVLP and CASIA-B, where the proposed DiGGAN\nhas outperformed state-of-the-art methods. Qualitative analysis has also been\nprovided and demonstrates the proposed DiGGAN's capability in providing\nevidences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Nov 2018 16:37:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2020 16:10:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2020 10:17:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-18"}

But the models themselves actually\ndepend on (i.e. are sensitive to) only a subset of those parameters. Rigorously\nidentifying this subset of \"stiff\" parameters has been made possible by the\ndevelopment of parameter space compression (PSC). However, PSC has only been\napplied to analytically-solvable physical models. We have generalized this\npowerful method by developing a numerical approach to PSC that can be applied\nto any computational model. We validated our method against\nanalytically-solvable models of random walk with drift and protein production\nand degradation. We then applied our method to an active area of biophysics\nresearch, namely to a simple computational model of microtubule dynamic\ninstability.

Furthermore, we show that the\nmicrotubule model has an underlying, low-dimensional structure that explains\nthe vast majority of our experimental data.

The objective is to preserve the underlying human\nidentity information after image translation, so that translated images with\nlabels are effective for feature learning on the target domain. To this end, we\npropose a similarity preserving generative adversarial network (SPGAN) and its\nend-to-end trainable version, eSPGAN.

Even in a simple setting, e.g., when the costs come from\nthe metric on the line, adding two nodes to the input might change the optimal\nsolution completely. On the other hand, one expects that small changes in the\ninput should incur only small changes on the constructed solutions, measured as\nthe number of modified edges. We introduce a two-stage model where we study the\ntrade-off between quality and robustness of solutions. In the first stage we\nare given a set of nodes in a metric space and we must compute a perfect\nmatching. In the second stage $2k$ new nodes appear and we must adapt the\nsolution to a perfect matching for the new instance.\n  We say that an algorithm is $(\\alpha,\\beta)$-robust if the solutions\nconstructed in both stages are $\\alpha$-approximate with respect to min-cost\nperfect matchings, and if the number of edges deleted from the first stage\nmatching is at most $\\beta k$. Hence, $\\alpha$ measures the quality of the\nalgorithm and $\\beta$ its robustness. In this setting we aim to balance both\nmeasures by deriving algorithms for constant $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. We show that\nthere exists an algorithm that is $(3,1)$-robust for any metric if one knows\nthe number $2k$ of arriving nodes in advance. For the case that $k$ is unknown\nthe situation is significantly more involved. We study this setting under the\nmetric on the line and devise a $(10,2)$-robust algorithm that constructs a\nsolution with a recursive structure that carefully balances cost and\nredundancy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Nov 2018 18:36:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 27 Apr 2019 20:27:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-30"}

The trajectory\nshould be designed in a way that the fairness rate is maximized over time. That\nmeans, the UAVs travel in the directions that maximize the minimum of the\nusers' SE. From the free-space path-loss channel model, a data-rate gradient is\ncalculated and used to direct the UAVs in a long-term perspective towards the\nlocal optimal solution on the two-dimensional spatial grid.

We show that although DAOs are quickly washed away in the non-linear\nclustering of DM at $z\\lesssim10$, their signature can be imprinted prominently\nin the Lyman-$\\alpha$ flux power spectrum at $z>5$. On scales larger than the\ncutoff ($k\\sim0.08$ s/km for the specific model considered here), the relative\ndifference to CDM is reminiscent of a warm dark matter (WDM) model with a\nsimilar initial cutoff; however, the redshift evolution on smaller scales is\ndistinctly different. The appearance and disappearance of DAOs in the\nLyman-$\\alpha$ flux spectrum provides a powerful way to distinguish interacting\nDM models from WDM and, indeed, variations in the thermal history of the IGM\nthat may also induce a small-scale cutoff.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Nov 2018 19:00:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 May 2019 15:30:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-10"}

To be consistent with the bounds, they need to be part of hidden\nsectors which interact with the Standard Model with weaker-than-Planck\nsuppressed interactions. We consider scenarios in which the visible sector\ndegrees of freedom are localised in the compactification and light moduli arise\nas closed string degrees of freedom associated with hidden sectors which are\ngeometrically separated (in the extra-dimensions) from the Standard Model.\nKinetic mixings lead to interactions between the moduli and the visible sector\n- we compute these using Kaehler potentials of string/M-theory\ncompactifications.

It has been shown that the effective dynamics of such GFT\ncondensates follows the classical Friedmann dynamics at late times, while\navoiding the classical singularity by a bounce akin to the one of loop quantum\ncosmology (LQC). It was also shown how quantum fluctuations in a GFT condensate\nprovide an initial power spectrum of volume fluctuations around exact\nhomogeneity. Here we connect the results for quantum fluctuations in GFT to the\nusual formalism for cosmological perturbations within quantum field theory in\ncurved spacetime.

The first aspect\nis how to mitigate their side effects for naturally trained deep learning\nsystems. One of the motivations for looking into this problem is to reduce the\nhigh power cost of conventional computing of neural networks through the use of\nanalog neuromorphic circuits. Traditional GPU/CPU-centered deep learning\narchitectures exhibit bottlenecks in power-restricted applications (e.g.,\nembedded systems). The use of specialized neuromorphic circuits, where analog\nsignals passed through memory-cell arrays are sensed to accomplish\nmatrix-vector multiplications, promises large power savings and speed gains but\nbrings with it the problems of limited precision of computations and\nunavoidable analog noise. We manage to improve inference accuracy from 21.1% to\n99.5% for MNIST images, from 29.9% to 89.1% for CIFAR10, and from 15.5% to\n89.6% for MNIST stroke sequences with the presence of strong noise (with\nsignal-to-noise power ratio being 0 dB) by noise-injected training and a voting\nmethod. This observation promises neural networks that are insensitive to\ninference noise, which reduces the quality requirements on neuromorphic\ncircuits and is crucial for their practical usage. The second aspect is how to\nutilize the noisy inference as a defensive architecture against black-box\nadversarial attacks. During inference, by injecting proper noise to signals in\nthe neural networks, the robustness of adversarially-trained neural networks\nagainst black-box attacks has been further enhanced by 0.5% and 1.13% for two\nadversarially trained models for MNIST and CIFAR10, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Nov 2018 19:18:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-28"}

HIP 79124 is a member of the\nScorpius-Centaurus association, consisting of an A0V primary with two low-mass\ncompanions at a projected separation of <1 arcsecond. Thanks to the high\nquality wavefront corrections provided by SCExAO, both companions are\ndecisively detected without the employment of any PSF-subtraction algorithm to\neliminate quasi-static noise. The spectrum of the outer C object is very well\nmatched by Upper Scorpius M4 pm 0.5 standard spectra, with a Teff = 2945 pm 100\nand a mass of 350 MJup. HIP 79124 B is detected at a separation of only 180 mas\nin a highly-correlated noise regime, and it falls in the spectral range M6 pm\n0.5 with Teff = 2840 pm 190 and 100 MJup. Previous studies of stellar\npopulations in Sco-Cen have highlighted a discrepancy in isochronal ages\nbetween the lower-mass and higher-mass populations. This could be explained\neither by an age spread in the region, or by conventional isochronal models\nfailing to reproduce the evolution of low-mass stars. The HIP 79124 system\nshould be coeval, and therefore it provides an ideal laboratory to test these\nscenarios. We place the three components in a color-magnitude diagram and find\nthat the models predict a younger age for the two low-mass companions (3 Myr)\nthan for the primary star (6 Myr). These results imply that the omission of\nmagnetic effects in conventional isochronal models inhibit them from\nreproducing early low-mass stellar evolution, which is further supported by the\nfact that new models that include such effects provide more consistent ages in\nthe HIP 79124 system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Nov 2018 20:50:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Dec 2018 15:25:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-30"}

Recently, the rather idealized\nconditions, assumed in the LLE, have materialized in the form of continuous\nwave driven optical microresonators, with the discovery of temporal dissipative\nKerr solitons (DKS).

We present an unsupervised representation learning\nframework to encode scene dynamics in videos captured from multiple viewpoints.\nThe proposed framework has two main components: Representation Learning Network\n(RL-NET), which learns a representation with the help of Blending Network\n(BL-NET), and Video Rendering Network (VR-NET), which is used for video\nsynthesis. The framework takes as input video clips from different viewpoints\nand time, learns an internal representation and uses this representation to\nrender a video clip from an arbitrary given viewpoint and time. The ability of\nthe proposed network to render video frames from arbitrary viewpoints and time\nenable it to learn a meaningful and robust representation of the scene\ndynamics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in rendering\nview-aware as well as time-aware video clips on two different real-world\ndatasets including UCF-101 and NTU-RGB+D. To further validate the effectiveness\nof the learned representation, we use it for the task of view-invariant\nactivity classification where we observe a significant improvement (~26%) in\nthe performance on NTU-RGB+D dataset compared to the existing state-of-the art\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Nov 2018 21:40:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Nov 2018 15:24:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-30"}

The goal of\nour method is to generate photo-realistic re-renderings of reconstructed\nobjects for virtual and augmented reality applications (e.g., virtual\nshowrooms, virtual tours \\& sightseeing, the digital inspection of historical\nartifacts). A core component of our work is the handling of view-dependent\neffects. Specifically, we directly train an object-specific deep neural network\nto synthesize the view-dependent appearance of an object. As input data we are\nusing an RGB video of the object. This video is used to reconstruct a proxy\ngeometry of the object via multi-view stereo. Based on this 3D proxy, the\nappearance of a captured view can be warped into a new target view as in\nclassical image-based rendering. This warping assumes diffuse surfaces, in case\nof view-dependent effects, such as specular highlights, it leads to artifacts.\nTo this end, we propose EffectsNet, a deep neural network that predicts\nview-dependent effects. Based on these estimations, we are able to convert\nobserved images to diffuse images. These diffuse images can be projected into\nother views. In the target view, our pipeline reinserts the new view-dependent\neffects. To composite multiple reprojected images to a final output, we learn a\ncomposition network that outputs photo-realistic results. Using this\nimage-guided approach, the network does not have to allocate capacity on\n``remembering'' object appearance, instead it learns how to combine the\nappearance of captured images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach\nboth qualitatively and quantitatively on synthetic as well as on real data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Nov 2018 22:24:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Jan 2020 15:30:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-16"}

Recently, a `drive-by' paradigm\nhas been proposed in which sensors are deployed on third-party vehicles,\nenabling wide coverage at low cost} Research on drive-by sensing has mostly\nfocused on sensor engineering, but a key question remains unexplored: How many\nvehicles would be required to adequately scan a city? Here, we address this\nquestion by analyzing the sensing power of a taxi fleet. Taxis, being numerous\nin cities and typically equipped with some sensing technology (e.g. GPS), are\nnatural hosts for the sensors. Our strategy is to view drive-by sensing as a\nspreading process, in which the area of sensed terrain expands as\nsensor-equipped taxis diffuse through a city's streets. In tandem with a simple\nmodel for the movements of the taxis, this analogy lets us analytically\ndetermine the fraction of a city's street network sensed by a fleet of taxis\nduring a day. Our results agree with taxi data obtained from nine major cities,\nand reveal that a remarkably small number of taxis can scan a large number of\nstreets. This finding appears to be universal, indicating its applicability to\ncities beyond those analyzed here. Moreover, because taxi motions combine\nrandomness and regularity (passengers' destinations being random, but the\nroutes to them being deterministic), the spreading properties of taxi fleets\nare unusual; in stark contrast to random walks, the stationary densities of our\ntaxi model obey Zipf's law, consistent with the empirical taxi data.

The frequency-dependent burst structure\ncomplicates the determination of a dispersion measure (DM); we argue that it is\nappropriate to use a DM metric that maximizes frequency-averaged pulse\nstructure, as opposed to peak signal-to-noise, and find DM = 560.57 +/- 0.07\npc/cc at MJD 57644.

This technique uses \"garbage alignment,\" i.e.,\naligning computations in coded computing that are not a part of the desired\noutput. Generalized PolyDot codes bridge between Polynomial codes and MatDot\ncodes, trading off between recovery threshold and communication costs. Second,\nwe demonstrate that Generalized PolyDot can be used for training large Deep\nNeural Networks (DNNs) on unreliable nodes prone to soft-errors. This requires\nus to address three additional challenges: (i) prohibitively large overhead of\ncoding the weight matrices in each layer of the DNN at each iteration; (ii)\nnonlinear operations during training, which are incompatible with linear\ncoding; and (iii) not assuming presence of an error-free master node, requiring\nus to architect a fully decentralized implementation without any \"single point\nof failure.\" We allow all primary DNN training steps, namely, matrix\nmultiplication, nonlinear activation, Hadamard product, and update steps as\nwell as the encoding/decoding to be error-prone. We consider the case of\nmini-batch size $B=1$, as well as $B>1$, leveraging coded matrix-vector\nproducts, and matrix-matrix products respectively.

Exploring parameter space is particularly important for predicting the\nobservable properties of exoplanets, for which few parameters are known with\ncertainty. Therefore, 1D climate models are still very useful tools for\nplanetary studies. In most of these 1D models, clouds are not physically\nrepresented in the atmosphere, despite having a well-known, significant impact\non a planetary radiative budget. This impact is simulated by artificially\nraising surface albedo, in order to reproduce the observed-averaged surface\ntemperature (i.e. 288 K for modern Earth) and a radiative balance at the top of\nthe atmosphere. This non-physical representation of clouds, causes atmospheric\nlongwave and shortwaves fluxes to not match observational data. Additionally,\nthis technique represents a parameter that is highly-tuned to modern Earth's\nclimate, and may not be appropriate for planets that deviate from modern\nEarth's climate conditions. In this paper, we present an update to the climate\nmodel within the Atmos 1D atmospheric modeling package with a physical\nrepresentation of clouds. We show that this physical representation of clouds\nin the atmosphere allows both longwave and shortwave fluxes to match\nobservational data. This improvement will allow us to study the energy fluxes\nfor a variety of cloudy rocky planets, and increase our confidence in future\nsimulations of temperature profile and net energy balance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Nov 2018 00:46:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-28"}

More specifically, multiple linear local\nclassifiers are firstly adopted to perform fine-grained classification at each\nlocation of high level CNN feature maps. The attention map is generated by\naggregating and max-pooling the output activations. Then the attention map\nserves as a surrogate target object mask to train those local classifiers,\nsimilar to training models for semantic segmentation.

We use an existing EBL model based on direct starlight emission at\nUV/visible and secondary radiation due to dust (PAHs (polycyclic aromatic\nhydrocarbons), small and large grains) at IR due to partial absorption of the\nstellar component. The relative contribution of each grain type to the total\nEBL energy density was determined from a combined fit to the Markarian 501\n($z\\sim 0.034$) SED in flare state, where both the parameters of the intrinsic\nsource spectrum and the dust fractions were allowed to vary. By separating the\nattenuation due to each EBL component, the importance of individual grain types\nto the opacity of the extragalactic medium for the TeV emission of a blazar\nlike Markarian 501 could be better understood. Using a nested log-likelihood\nratio test, we compared null hypotheses represented by effective 1- and 2-grain\nmodels against a 3-grain alternative scenario.

One simiple and intutive method is to utilize two\nidentical code matrices produced by hash functions to approximate a pairwise\nreal label matrix. However, the resulting quartic problem is difficult to\ndirectly solve due to the non-convex and non-smooth nature of the objective. In\nthis paper, unlike previous optimization methods using various relaxation\nstrategies, we aim to directly solve the original quartic problem using a novel\nalternative optimization mechanism to linearize the quartic problem by\nintroducing a linear regression model. Additionally, we find that gradually\nlearning each batch of binary codes in a sequential mode, i.e. batch by batch,\nis greatly beneficial to the convergence of binary code learning. Based on this\nsignificant discovery and the proposed strategy, we introduce a scalable\nsymmetric discrete hashing algorithm that gradually and smoothly updates each\nbatch of binary codes. To further improve the smoothness, we also propose a\ngreedy symmetric discrete hashing algorithm to update each bit of batch binary\ncodes. Moreover, we extend the proposed optimization mechanism to solve the\nnon-convex optimization problems for binary code learning in many other\npairwise based hashing algorithms.

The nth (secretive) agent can make an arbitrary\nselection after the division has been proposed and, irrespective of her choice,\nthe computed division will admit an overall fair allocation.\n  For the rent-division setting we prove that the (well-behaved) utilities of\nn-1 agents suffice to find a rent division among n rooms such that, for every\npossible room selection of the secretive agent, there exists an allocation (of\nthe remaining n-1 rooms among the n-1 agents) which ensures overall envy\nfreeness (fairness). We complement this existential result by developing a\npolynomial-time algorithm that finds such a fair rent division under\nquasilinear utilities.\n  In this partial information setting, we also develop efficient algorithms to\ncompute allocations that are envy-free up to one good (EF1) and\nepsilon-approximate envy free. These two notions of fairness are applicable in\nthe context of indivisible goods and divisible goods (cake cutting),\nrespectively. This work also addresses fairness in terms of proportionality and\nmaximin shares. Our key result here is an efficient algorithm that, even with a\nsecretive agent, finds a 1/19-approximate maximin fair allocation (of\nindivisible goods) under submodular valuations of the non-secretive agents.\n  One of the main technical contributions of this paper is the development of\nnovel connections between different fair-division paradigms, e.g., we use our\nexistential results for envy-free rent-division to develop an efficient EF1\nalgorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Nov 2018 08:02:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-28"}

There are many papers\ndevoted to this problem. But all of them are concentrated on dynamics of a\nfilm, paying small attention to substrate. In these papers the substrate is\njust an object absorbing the first shock. Here we present another point of view\ndirected onto dynamics of a substrate. We consider (i) generation of a shock\nwave (SW) in a support by impact of a contact; (ii) transition from\none-dimensional to two-dimensional (2D) propagation of SW; (iii) we analyze\nlateral propagation of the SW along a film-support contact; and (iv) we\ncalculate pressure in the compressed layer behind the decaying SW. This\npositive pressure acting from substrate to the film accelerates the film in\ndirection to vacuum. Above some threshold, velocity of accelerated film is\nenough to separate the film from support. In these cases the circle of\nseparation is significantly wider than the circle of the focal laser spot on\nfilm surface. Absorbed laser heat exponentially decays around an irradiated\nspot $F=F_{\\rm c} \\exp(-r^2/R_{\\rm L}^2)$, where $R_{\\rm L}$ is radius of a\nGaussian beam, $F$ and $F_{\\rm c}$ are local and central fluences, $r$ is a\nradius from the axis. While the law of decay for the 2D SW in substrate is the\npower law. Therefore in our case of powerful laser action the edge of a\nseparation circle is defined by propagation of the SW in the support.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Nov 2018 08:18:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

A set of compact data\nstore and index structures are proposed to describe the proposed scientific\nevents and a typical analysis pattern is formulized as a set of query\noperations.

The existence of such clumps\nare inferred from intervening quasar absorption systems, but have long been\nsomething of a theoretical mystery. We consider the implications for compact\nradio sources of the `fog-like' two-phase model of the circumgalactic medium\nrecently proposed by McCourt et al.(2018). In this model, the CGM consists of a\ndiffuse coronal gas ($T\\gtrsim 10^6\\,$K) in pressure equilibrium with numerous\n$\\lesssim 1\\,$pc scale cool clumps or `cloudlets' formed by shattering in a\ncooling instability. The areal filling factor of the cloudlets is expected to\nexceed unity in $\\gtrsim 10^{11.5} M_\\odot$ haloes, and the ensuing radio-wave\nscattering is akin to that caused by turbulence in the Galactic warm ionized\nmedium (WIM). If $30\\,$per-cent of cosmic baryons are in the CGM, we show that\nfor a cool-gas volume fraction of $f_{\\rm v}\\sim 10^{-3}$, sources at $z_{\\rm\ns}\\sim 1$ suffer angular broadening by $\\sim 15\\,\\mu$as and temporal broadening\nby $\\sim 1\\,$ms at $\\lambda = 30\\,$cm, due to scattering by the clumps in\nintervening CGM. The former prediction will be difficult to test (the angular\nbroadening will suppress Galactic scintillation only for $<10\\,\\mu$Jy compact\nsynchrotron sources). However the latter prediction, of temporal broadening of\nlocalized fast radio bursts, can constrain the size and mass fraction of cool\nionized gas clumps as function of halo mass and redshift, and thus provides a\ntest of the model proposed by McCourt et al.(2018).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Nov 2018 08:53:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-19"}

With the advent of\nadvanced sensing technologies and the Internet of Things, the efficient\ninterpretation of structural health monitoring data has become a big data\nchallenge. Many models have been proposed in literature to represent such data,\nsuch as linear statistical models.

The most used type of recurrent layer is the\nLong-Short Term Memory (LSTM). The motivations to do so are many: there are few\nopen-source implementations of 2D-LSTM, even fewer supporting GPU\nimplementations (currently cuDNN only implements 1D-LSTM); 2D recurrences\nreduce the amount of computations that can be parallelized, and thus possibly\nincrease the training/inference time; recurrences create global dependencies\nwith respect to the input, and sometimes this may not be desirable.\n  Many recent competitions were won by systems that employed networks that use\n2D-LSTM layers. Most previous work that compared 1D or pure feed-forward\narchitectures to 2D recurrent models have done so on simple datasets or did not\nfully optimize the \"baseline\" 2D model compared to the challenger model, which\nwas dully optimized.\n  In this work, we aim at a fair comparison between 2D and competing models and\nalso extensively evaluate them on more complex datasets that are more\nrepresentative of challenging \"real-world\" data, compared to \"academic\"\ndatasets that are more restricted in their complexity.

We show that the value of the core's\nmass mainly depends on the assumed size and composition of the solids, while\nthe heavy-element distribution is also affected by the fate of the accreted\nplanetesimals (ablation/fragmentation). Fragmentation, which is found to be\nimportant for planetesimals > 1 km, typically leads to enrichment of the inner\npart of the envelope while ablation results in enrichment of the outer\natmosphere. Finally, we present a semi-analytical prescription for deriving the\nheavy-element distribution in giant protoplanets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Nov 2018 10:40:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-08"}

Naive anonymisation of social network graphs often consists in\ndeleting all identifying information of the users, while maintaining the\noriginal graph structure. Various types of attacks on naively anonymised graphs\nhave been developed. Active attacks form a special type of such privacy\nattacks, in which the adversary enrols a number of fake users, often called\nsybils, to the social network, allowing the adversary to create unique\nstructural patterns later used to re-identify the sybil nodes and other users\nafter anonymisation. Several studies have shown that adding a small amount of\nnoise to the published graph already suffices to mitigate such active attacks.\nConsequently, active attacks have been dubbed a negligible threat to\nprivacy-preserving social graph publication. In this paper, we argue that these\nstudies unveil shortcomings of specific attacks, rather than inherent problems\nof active attacks as a general strategy. In order to support this claim, we\ndevelop the notion of a robust active attack, which is an active attack that is\nresilient to small perturbations of the social network graph. We formulate the\ndesign of robust active attacks as an optimisation problem and we give\ndefinitions of robustness for different stages of the active attack strategy.\nMoreover, we introduce various heuristics to achieve these notions of\nrobustness and experimentally show that the new robust attacks are considerably\nmore resilient than the original ones, while remaining at the same level of\nfeasibility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Nov 2018 11:21:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

The peculiar value of the reflection\nfraction brought us to analyse further broadband spectra of 4U 1702-429. We\nre-analysed the spectrum of the XMM-Newton/INTEGRAL observation of 4U 1702-429\nin the 0.3-60 keV energy range and we extracted three 0.1-100 keV spectra of\nthe source analysing three observations collected with the BeppoSAX satellite.\nWe find that the XMM-Newton/INTEGRAL spectrum is well fitted using a model\ncomposed of a disc blackbody plus a Comptonised component and a smeared\nreflection component. We used the same spectral model for the BeppoSAX spectra,\nfinding out that the addition of a smeared reflection component is\nstatistically significant. The best-fit values of the parameters are compatible\nto each other for the BeppoSAX spectra. We find that the reflection fraction is\n$0.05^{+0.03}_{-0.01}$ for the XMM-Newton/INTEGRAL spectrum and between 0.15\nand 0.4 for BeppoSAX ones. The relative reflection fraction and the ionisation\nparameter are incompatible between the XMM-Newton/INTEGRAL and the BeppoSAX\nobservations and the characteristics of the Comptonising corona suggest that\nthe source was in a soft state in the former observation and in a hard state in\nthe latter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Nov 2018 11:33:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-09"}

This prediction implies that the solid metallic\nhydrogen remains in the metallic solid phase state even after it is released\nfrom high pressure. Shock compression synthesized liquid metallic hydrogen so\nfar. However, to obtain metallic hydrogen under ambient pressure at room\ntemperature, it is necessary to synthesize solid metallic hydrogen.

In this paper, I investigate the possibility\nthat tidal disruptions of stars are responsible for the observed AGN in dwarf\ngalaxies. I show that the expected duty cycles of TDE-powered AGN, $f_{\\rm AGN}\n\\geq 0.5\\%$, are consistent with observed AGN fractions assuming that the\noccupation fraction in dwarf galaxies is close to unity. Furthermore, I\ncalculate the properties of outflows driven by TDE-powered AGN under idealised\nconditions and find that they might have noticeable effects on the host\ngalaxies.

Video frame prediction is a task analogous to motion\ncompensation. In recent years, the task of frame prediction is undertaken by\ndeep neural networks (DNNs). In this thesis we create a DNN to perform learned\nframe prediction and additionally implement a codec that contains our DNN. We\ntrain our network using two methods for two different goals. Firstly we train\nour network based on mean square error (MSE) only, aiming to obtain highest\nPSNR values at frame prediction and video compression. Secondly we use\nadversarial training to produce visually more realistic frame predictions. For\nframe prediction, we compare our method with the baseline methods of frame\ndifference and 16x16 block motion compensation. For video compression we\nfurther include x264 video codec in the comparison. We show that in frame\nprediction, adversarial training produces frames that look sharper and more\nrealistic, compared MSE based training, but in video compression it\nconsistently performs worse. This proves that even though adversarial training\nis useful for generating video frames that are more pleasing to the human eye,\nthey should not be employed for video compression. Moreover, our network\ntrained with MSE produces accurate frame predictions, and in quantitative\nresults, for both tasks, it produces comparable results in all videos and\noutperforms other methods on average. More specifically, learned frame\nprediction outperforms other methods in terms of rate-distortion performance in\ncase of high motion video, while the rate-distortion performance of our method\nis competitive with that of x264 in low motion video.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Nov 2018 12:53:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-25"}

Recent advances demonstrate the\nviability of direct communication among heterogeneous IoT devices with\nincompatible physical (PHY) layers.

How a material behaves when\nsubjected to high or fluctuating temperatures can be critical to the safety and\nlongevity of a system's essential components. The laser flash experiment is a\nwell-established technique for indirectly measuring the thermal diffusivity,\nand hence the thermal conductivity, of a material. In previous works,\noptimization schemes have been used to find estimates of the thermal\nconductivity and other quantities of interest which best fit a given model to\nexperimental data. Adopting a Bayesian approach allows for prior beliefs about\nuncertain model inputs to be conditioned on experimental data to determine a\nposterior distribution, but probing this distribution using sampling techniques\nsuch as Markov chain Monte Carlo methods can be incredibly computationally\nintensive. This difficulty is especially true for forward models consisting of\ntime-dependent partial differential equations. We pose the problem of\ndetermining the thermal conductivity of a material via the laser flash\nexperiment as a Bayesian inverse problem in which the laser intensity is also\ntreated as uncertain. We introduce a parametric surrogate model that takes the\nform of a stochastic Galerkin finite element approximation, also known as a\ngeneralized polynomial chaos expansion, and show how it can be used to sample\nefficiently from the approximate posterior distribution. This approach gives\naccess not only to the sought-after estimate of the thermal conductivity but\nalso important information about its relationship to the laser intensity, and\ninformation for uncertainty quantification. We also investigate the effects of\nthe spatial profile of the laser on the estimated posterior distribution for\nthe thermal conductivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Nov 2018 13:38:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

Based on this, we present\na unified statistical modeling framework that permits prediction of the timing\nand spatial location of future vision loss and informs clinical decisions\nregarding disease progression.

To progress in the understanding of\nthe physical processes involved in the disk formation, we estimate the disk\nparameters for a sample of Be stars and search for correlations between these\nparameters and stellar properties. We performed spectro-interferometric\nobservations of 26 Be stars in the region of the Br$\\gamma$ line to study the\nkinematical properties of their disks through the Doppler effect.

We modeled\n18 Be stars with emission in the Br$\\gamma$ line. The disk kinematic is\ndescribed by a quasi-Keplerian rotation law, with the exception of HD28497 that\npresents a one-arm density-wave structure. Using a combined sample, we derived\na mean value for the velocity ratio V/Vc=0.75, and found that rotation axes are\nprobably randomly distributed in the sky. Disk sizes in the line component\nmodel are in the range of 2-13 stellar radii and do not correlate with the\neffective temperature or spectral type. However, we found that the maximum size\nof a stable disk correlates with the rotation velocity at the inner part of the\ndisk and the stellar mass. We found that, on average, the Be stars of our\ncombined sample do not rotate at their critical velocity. However, the\ncentrifugal force and mass of the star defines an upper limit size for a stable\ndisk configuration. For a given rotation, high-mass Be stars tend to have more\ncompact disks than their low-mass counterparts. It would be interesting to\nfollow up the evolution of the disk size in variable stars to better understand\nthe formation and dissipation processes of their circumstellar disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Nov 2018 15:31:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-16"}

In this paper, we propose a fast\nobject detection method by taking advantage of this with a novel Motion aided\nMemory Network (MMNet). The MMNet has two major advantages: 1) It significantly\naccelerates the procedure of feature extraction for compressed videos. It only\nneed to run a complete recognition network for I-frames, i.e. a few reference\nframes in a video, and it produces the features for the following P frames\n(predictive frames) with a light weight memory network, which runs fast; 2)\nUnlike existing methods that establish an additional network to model motion of\nframes, we take full advantage of both motion vectors and residual errors that\nare freely available in video streams. To our best knowledge, the MMNet is the\nfirst work that investigates a deep convolutional detector on compressed\nvideos.

The agent extracts spatial relations from\na sparse set of noisy examples of block-based structures, and trains\nconvolutional and sequential models of those relation sets.

Dynamically simulating such flows requires resolution of acoustic\nand hydraulic waves existing at vastly different spatial and temporal scales.\nIf simulated on the same numerical grid, the need for accuracy in hydraulic\nwaves will necessitate an exaggerated resolution of acoustic waves. Likewise,\ntime steps restricted by the speed of sound are small compared to the time\nscales active in hydraulic waves. This constitutes a waste of computational\npotential. The method proposed herein decouples the hydraulic and acoustic\nscales, greatly improving computational efficiency.\n  The proposed dual grid method solves a four-equation compressible two-fluid\nmodel on a principal grid which robustly accounts for the pressure evolution\nand conserves mass and momentum. An incompressible two-equation model is at the\nsame time solved on a finer grid, resolving the details of the hydraulic\nevolution. Information from both model formulations is coupled through the\nterms of the governing transport equations, providing consistency between the\ngrids. Accurate and finely resolved schemes can then be employed for the\nincompressible two-fluid model without suffering from the time and stability\nrestrictions otherwise enforced by acoustic waves. At the same time, the Hybrid\nCentral-Upwind flux splitting scheme of Evje and Fl{\\aa}tten (2005a) allows for\nan explicit and numerically robust treatment of the acoustic waves without\nlosing hydraulic accuracy.\n  The dual grid method is tested against four dissimilar problems.

The main focus is finding numerically\nefficient ways of capturing wave dynamics and flow regime transitions through\ndirect simulation. Characteristic methods offer the possibility of simulating\nhyperbolic systems without numerical dissipation. These methods do however lack\ncertain fundamental conservation properties. Challenges related to information\nscattering and clustering in space and time, particularly around shocks, are\nalso an issue in some method variants. Hybridisations with the finite volume\nmethod are proposed which overcome these shortcomings. All methods are\ncompared, evaluating predictions on the onset of linear wave growth and\nsimulations of non-linear, discontinuous roll-waves. The following observations\nare made: 1. Characteristic methods are excellent at predicting the onset of\nlinear hydrodynamic instability, even with a small number of computational\nnodes. 2. Dissipative errors in finite volume methods and characteristic\nhybrids will be closely linked to the Courant number. The Roe scheme and the\ncharacteristic hybrids give very little dissipation error as the Courant number\napproaches unity. This then becomes a question of numerical stability. 3.\nAdapting dynamic grid cells, moving along with the characteristics information\ndrift, greatly improves simulation efficiency by allowing for longer time\nsteps. Dynamic grid cells are also useful for alleviating the need for\ninterpolation in characteristic methods.

The gauge-like invariance implies that the fifth dimension\nis not directly observable; it also implies that charge is a constant of\nmotion. The scalar field is analogous to the Brans-Dicke scalar field, and the\ntheory tends towards the Einstein-Maxwell theory in the limit as the coupling\nconstant tends to infinity.

This relies on the definition of Hilbert spaces of\nkinematically and statically admissible tensor fields, whose orthogonality and\nduality properties are recalled. These are endowed with specific energetic\nscalar products that make use of a reference and uniform elasticity tensor. The\ncorresponding strain and stress Green's operators are introduced and\ninterpreted as orthogonal projection operators in the admissibility spaces. In\nthis context and as an alternative to classical minimum energy principles, two\ngeometric variational principles are investigated with the introduction of\nfunctionals that aim at measuring the discrepancy of arbitrary test fields to\nthe kinematic, static or material admissibility conditions of the problem.

This parameter identification problem exposes the need for a local\nreconstruction procedure that is investigated here in the case of materials\nwith small contrast. To begin with the integral formulation framework for the\nperiodic linear elasticity problem, first- and second-order asymptotics are\nretained for the strain field solution and the effective elasticity tensor.\nProperties of the featured Green's tensor are investigated to characterize its\ndecomposition into an isotropic term and an orthogonal part. The former is then\nshown to define a local contribution to the volume integral equations\nconsidered. Based on this property, then the combination of multiple strain\nfield solutions corresponding to well-chosen applied macroscopic strains is\nshown to lead to a set of local and uncoupled identities relating,\nrespectively, the bulk and shear moduli to the spherical and deviatoric\ncomponents of the strain fields. Valid at the first-order in the weak contrast\nlimit, such relations permit point-wise conversions of strain maps into\nelasticity maps. Furthermore, it is also shown that for macroscopically\nisotropic material configurations a single strain field solution is actually\nsufficient to reconstruct either the bulk or the shear modulus distribution.\nThose results are then revisited in the case of bounded media. Finally, some\nsets of analytical and numerical examples are provided for comparison and to\nillustrate the relevance of the obtained strain-modulus local equations for a\nparameter identification method based on full-field data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Nov 2018 12:59:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-10"}
