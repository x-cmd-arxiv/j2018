Based on a similarity function (\"kernel\"), we define\na structural metric that unifies the description of nearest- and\nnext-nearest-neighbor environments in the amorphous state. We apply this to an\nensemble of a-Si networks, generated in melt-quench simulations with an\nML-based interatomic potential, in which we tailor the degree of ordering by\nvarying the quench rates down to $10^{10}$ K/s (leading to a structural model\nthat is lower in energy than the established WWW network).

Given the inefficiencies\nusing standard inferential procedures for DLMs associated with infrequent and\nirregularly recorded response data, we develop an approach that relies on\nfactoring the posterior density into a product of two terms; a marginal\nposterior density for the non-dynamic parameters, and a multivariate normal\nposterior density of the dynamic parameters conditional on the non-dynamic\nones.

We conclude that leptons should\nnot be ignored even if CP violation is limited to the quark sector. The role of\nleptons can be further increased in scenarios of new physics with additional\nchiral-symmetry-breaking interactions between quarks and leptons, as can happen\nin models with additional Higgs bosons or leptoquarks.

We have created a method\nfor reducing and controlling the speed of DNA that uses two independently\ncontrollable nanopores operated with an active control logic. The pores are\npositioned sufficiently close to permit co-capture of a single DNA by both\npores. Once co-capture occurs, control logic turns on constant competing\nvoltages at the pores leading to a `tug-of-war' whereby the molecule is pulled\nfrom both ends by opposing forces. These forces exert both conformational and\nspeed control over the co-captured molecule, removing folds and reducing the\ntranslocation rate. When the voltages are tuned so that the electrophoretic\nforce applied to both ends of the molecule comes into balance, the life-time of\nthe tug-of-war state is limited purely by diffusive sliding of the DNA between\nthe pores. We are able to produce a tug-of-war state on 76.8% of molecules that\nare captured with a maximum two-order of magnitude increase in average pore\ntranslocation time relative to the average time for single-pore translocation.\nMoreover, we quantify the translocation slow-down as a function of voltage\ntuning and show that the slow-down is well described by a first passage\nanalysis for a one-dimensional sub-diffusive process. The ionic current of each\nnanopore provides an independent sensor that synchronously measures a different\nregion of the same molecule, enabling sequential detection of physical labels,\nsuch as mono-streptavidin tags.

The present work was\nmotivated by the effort to explain the coisotropic structure of the constraint\nsubset for the initial value problem by extending the notion of hamiltonian\nstructure from Lie algebra actions to general Lie algebroids over presymplectic\nmanifolds. After comparing possible compatibility conditions between the anchor\n$A\\to TM$ and the presymplectic structure on the base $M$, we choose the most\nnatural of them, given by a suitably chosen connection on $A$. We define a\nnotion of momentum section of $A^*$ and a condition for compatibility with the\nLie bracket. A Lie algebroid over a presymplectic manifold with compatible\nanchor and momentum section is then called hamiltonian. For an action Lie\nalgebroid, we retrieve the conditions of a hamiltonian action. The clean zero\nlocus of the momentum section of a hamiltonian Lie algebroid is a coisotropic\nsubmanifold. We show that a bracket-compatible momentum map is equivalent to a\nclosed basic extension of the presymplectic form, within the generalization of\nthe BRST model of equivariant cohomology to Lie algebroids.

Nevertheless, if the mass of\nthe dark matter is very small, the effective pressure can be very large, and\nthus, a system of self-gravitating fermions can be formed. In this work we\nmodel the dark matter halo of the Milky-Way by solving the\nTolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations, with the equation of state for a\npartially degenerate ultralight non interacting fermion. It is found that in\norder to fit its rotational velocity curve of the Milky Way, the mass of the\nfermion should be in the range $29 ~\\mbox{eV} < m_F < 33~$eV.

We analyze the properties of\nrandom scalar-input feed-forward rectified linear unit architectures, which are\nrandom linear splines.

This is important for models which generate relics due to an\nenhanced amplitude of the primordial scalar perturbations, such as primordial\nblack holes. In order to generate them, the power spectrum needs to grow many\norders of magnitude larger than its observed value on CMB scales - typically\nachieved through a phase of ultra slow-roll inflation - and is thus subject to\nadditional constraints at small scales. We plot all relevant constraints\nincluding CMB spectral distortions and gravitational waves sourced by scalar\nperturbations at second order. We show how this limits the allowed mass of\nPBHs, especially for the large masses of interest following recent detections\nby LIGO and prospects for constraining them further with future observations.\nWe show that any transition from approximately constant $\\epsilon$ slow-roll\ninflation to a phase where the power spectrum rapidly rises necessarily implies\nan intervening dip in power. We also show how to reconstruct a potential that\ncan reproduce an arbitrary time-varying $\\epsilon$, offering a complementary\nperspective on how ultra slow-roll can be achieved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Nov 2018 18:47:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2018 12:39:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 21 Jun 2019 10:02:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-24"}

Second, the granularity of the updates e.g. whether the\nupdates are local to each data point and employ message passing or global.\nThird, the method of optimization (bespoke or blackbox, closed-form or\nstochastic updates, etc.). This paper presents a new framework, termed\nPartitioned Variational Inference (PVI), that explicitly acknowledges these\nalgorithmic dimensions of VI, unifies disparate literature, and provides\nguidance on usage. Crucially, the proposed PVI framework allows us to identify\nnew ways of performing VI that are ideally suited to challenging learning\nscenarios including federated learning (where distributed computing is\nleveraged to process non-centralized data) and continual learning (where new\ndata and tasks arrive over time and must be accommodated quickly). We showcase\nthese new capabilities by developing communication-efficient federated training\nof Bayesian neural networks and continual learning for Gaussian process models\nwith private pseudo-points. The new methods significantly outperform the\nstate-of-the-art, whilst being almost as straightforward to implement as\nstandard VI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Nov 2018 19:16:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-29"}

The curved capsules serve as a model\nfor the typical crescent-shaped sickle red blood cells in sickle cell disease\n(SCD). The effects of deformability and curvature on the dynamics are revealed.\nWe show that with low deformability, straight prolate spheroidal capsules\ntumble in the shear plane as their unique asymptotically stable orbit, which\ncontrasts with that for rigid spheroids where infinitely many neutrally stable\nJeffery orbits exist. The dynamics of curved prolate capsules are more\ncomplicated due to a combined effect of deformability and curvature. At short\ntimes, depending on the initial orientation, slightly deformable curved prolate\ncapsules exhibit either a Jeffery-like motion such as tumbling or kayaking, or\na non-Jeffery-like behavior in which the end-to-end vector of the capsule\ncrosses the shear-gradient plane back and forth. At long times, however, a\nJeffery-like quasi-periodic orbit is taken regardless of the initial\norientation. We further show that the average of the long-time trajectory can\nbe well approximated using the analytical solution for Jeffery orbits with an\neffective orbit constant $C_{\\textnormal{eff}}$ and aspect ratio\n$\\ell_{\\textnormal{eff}}$. As the capsule becomes more deformable or curved,\n$C_{\\textnormal{eff}}$ decreases, indicating a shift of the orbit towards\nlog-rolling motion, while $\\ell_{\\textnormal{eff}}$ increases weakly as the\ndegree of curvature increases but shows negligible dependency on deformability.\nAs cell deformability, cell shape, and cell-cell interactions are all\npathologically altered in blood disorders such as SCD, these results will have\nclear implications on improving our understanding of the pathophysiology of\nhematologic disease.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Nov 2018 19:21:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-29"}

On 3 mm^3 CT volumes, our GPU implementation is 2.6-8X faster than a\nwidely-used CPU version, including communication overhead. We also show how to\nautomatically generate training labels using rudimentary morphological\noperations, which are efficiently computed by 3D Fourier transforms.

The evolution of regions of\nammonia-rich partial melt could strongly influence the geological and thermal\nevolution of icy bodies. For melt to be extracted from partially molten\nregions, the surrounding solid matrix must deform and compact. Whether\nammonia-rich melts sink to the subsurface ocean or become frozen into the ice\nshell depends on the compaction rate and thermal evolution. Here we construct a\nmodel for the compaction and thermal evolution of a partially molten,\nammonia-rich ice shell in a one-dimensional geometry. We model the thickening\nof an initially thin ice shell above an ocean with $10\\%$ ammonia. We find that\nammonia-rich melts can freeze into the upper $5$ to $10$ kilometers of the ice\nshell, when ice shell thickening is rapid compared to the compaction rate. The\ntrapping of near-surface volatiles suggests that, upon reheating of the ice\nshell, eutectic melting events are possible. However, as the ice shell\nthickening rate decreases, ammonia-rich melt is efficiently excluded from the\nice shell and the bulk of the ice shell is pure water ice. We apply our results\nto the thermal evolution of Neptune's moon Triton. As Triton's ice shell\nthickens, the gradual increase of ammonia concentration in Triton's subsurface\nocean helps to prevent freezing and increases the predicted final ocean\nthickness by up to $50$ km.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Nov 2018 21:01:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

However, for complex, cluttered and unseen\nenvironments with high uncertainty, autonomous driving systems still frequently\ndemonstrate erroneous or unexpected behaviors, that could lead to catastrophic\noutcomes. Autonomous vehicles should ideally adapt to driving conditions; while\nthis can be achieved through multiple routes, it would be beneficial as a first\nstep to be able to characterize Driveability in some quantified form. To this\nend, this paper aims to create a framework for investigating different factors\nthat can impact driveability. Also, one of the main mechanisms to adapt\nautonomous driving systems to any driving condition is to be able to learn and\ngeneralize from representative scenarios. The machine learning algorithms that\ncurrently do so learn predominantly in a supervised manner and consequently\nneed sufficient data for robust and efficient learning.

Furthermore, by discussions of what driving\nscenarios are not covered by existing public datasets and what driveability\nfactors need more investigation and data acquisition, this paper aims to\nencourage both targeted dataset collection and the proposal of novel\ndriveability metrics that enhance the robustness of autonomous cars in adverse\nenvironments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Nov 2018 21:53:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-29"}

Total variation (TV)\nhas been widely used as an edge-preserving regularizer. However, objects are\noften over-regularized by TV, becoming blob-like convex structures of low\ncurvature. This phenomenon was explained mathematically in the analysis of\nAndreau et al. They have shown that a TV regularizer can spatially preserve\nperfectly sets which are nonlinear eigenfunctions of the form $\\lambda u \\in\n\\partial J_{TV}(u)$, where $\\partial J_{TV}(u)$ is the TV subdifferential. For\nTV, these shapes are convex sets of low-curvature. A compelling approach to\nbetter preserve structures is to use anisotropic functionals, which adapt the\nregularization in an image-driven manner, with strong regularization along\nedges and low across them. This follows earlier ideas of Weickert on\nanisotropic diffusion, which do not stem directly from functional minimization.\nAdaptive anisotropic TV (A$^2$TV) was successfully used in several studies in\nthe past decade. However, until now there is no theory formulating the type of\nstructures which can be perfectly preserved. In this study we address this\nquestion. We rely on a recently developed theory of Burger et al on nonlinear\nspectral analysis of one-homogeneous functionals. We have that eigenfunction\nsets, admitting $\\lambda u \\in \\partial J_{A^2TV}(u)$, are perfectly preserved\nunder A$^2$TV-flow or minimization with $L^2$ square fidelity. We thus\ninvestigate these eigenfunctions theoretically and numerically.

Its practice always\nexplores the new possibilities of information and communication technologies.\nTherefore, interactivity and participation have become key features in the\ndesign process. Even in traditional print media, graphic designers are trying\nto enhance user experience and exploring new interaction models. Moving posters\nare an example of this.

For a given HIN, many reasonable clustering results\nwith distinct semantic meaning can simultaneously exist. User-guided clustering\nis hence of great practical value for HINs where users provide labels to a\nsmall portion of nodes. To cater to a broad spectrum of user guidance evidenced\nby different expected clustering results, carefully exploiting the signals\nresiding in the data is potentially useful. Meanwhile, as one type of complex\nnetworks, HINs often encapsulate higher-order interactions that reflect the\ninterlocked nature among nodes and edges. Network motifs, sometimes referred to\nas meta-graphs, have been used as tools to capture such higher-order\ninteractions and reveal the many different semantics. We therefore approach the\nproblem of user-guided clustering in HINs with network motifs. In this process,\nwe identify the utility and importance of directly modeling higher-order\ninteractions without collapsing them to pairwise interactions. To achieve this,\nwe comprehensively transcribe the higher-order interaction signals to a series\nof tensors via motifs and propose the MoCHIN model based on joint non-negative\ntensor factorization. This approach applies to arbitrarily many, arbitrary\nforms of HIN motifs. An inference algorithm with speed-up methods is also\nproposed to tackle the challenge that tensor size grows exponentially as the\nnumber of nodes in a motif increases. We validate the effectiveness of the\nproposed method on two real-world datasets and three tasks, and MoCHIN\noutperforms all baselines in three evaluation tasks under three different\nmetrics.

Fundamentally, this occurs due to the problem transformation nature of\nseveral MLC algorithms used in this work. These algorithms transform an MLC\nproblem into one or several SLC problems in the first place and solve them with\nSLC model(s) in a next step. Therefore, understanding their main\ncharacteristics is crucial to this work. Finally, we present a formal\ndescription of the search spaces by proposing a context-free grammar that\nencompasses the 54 learning algorithms. This grammar basically comprehends the\npossible combinations, the constraints and dependencies among the learning\nalgorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2018 02:19:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 2019 02:42:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 May 2020 13:52:01 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 14 May 2020 14:32:48 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2020 17:06:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-03"}

This can be attributed to environmental effects such as\nram pressure stripping and tidal interactions, which remove HI from the discs\nof galaxies. However, some spirals in low-density environments have also been\nobserved to have relatively low HI mass fractions. The low densities of the\nIntergalactic Medium and lack of nearby galaxies in such environments make ram\npressure stripping and tidal interactions unlikely candidates of gas removal.\nWhat then could be making these spirals HI deficient? Obreschkow et al.\nintroduced a parameter-free model for the neutral atomic gas fraction\n($f_{atm}$), in a symmetric equilibrium disc as a function of the global atomic\nstability parameter ($q$), which depends on specific angular momentum. In order\nto examine if this model accounts for HI-deficient galaxies in low-density\nenvironments, we have used the $M_{HI} ~-$ M$_{R}$ scaling relation to select\nsix HI-deficient spiral galaxies and observed them with the ATCA. By measuring\ntheir $f_{atm}$ and $q$ values we find that the galaxies owe their observed HI\ndeficiencies to low specific angular momenta. Additionally, we also find that\nthe central HI hole sizes of our sample galaxies are related to their $q$\nvalues, following the prediction of Obreschkow et al.

A\nprobabilistic inference network simulator (PIN-Sim) is developed to realize a\ncircuit-level model of an RBM utilizing resistive crossbar arrays along with\ndifferential amplifiers to implement the positive and negative weight values.\nThe PIN-Sim is composed of five main blocks to train a DBN, evaluate its\naccuracy, and measure its power consumption. The MNIST dataset is leveraged to\ninvestigate the energy and accuracy tradeoffs of seven distinct network\ntopologies in SPICE using the 14nm HP-FinFET technology library with the\nnominal voltage of 0.8V, in which an MRAM-based neuron is used as the\nactivation function. The software and hardware level simulations indicate that\na $784\\times200\\times10$ topology can achieve less than 5% error rates with\n$\\sim400 pJ$ energy consumption. The error rates can be reduced to 2.5% by\nusing a $784\\times500\\times500\\times500\\times10$ DBN at the cost of\n$\\sim10\\times$ higher energy consumption and significant area overhead.\nFinally, the effects of specific hardware-level parameters on power dissipation\nand accuracy tradeoffs are identified via the developed PIN-Sim framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2018 05:23:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-01"}

Targeting the small measurement per antenna\nbut large number of antennas setup, independent sensing matrices do offer\nsignificant performance advantages. Unfortunately, the IoT random access\nproblem can not readily benefit from this concept as code matrix is fixed over\nall receiving antennas. Our contributions towards addressing this challenge are\nas follows. First, independent small-scale fading across antennas and users is\nestablished as a possible source of sensing matrix decorrelation. Secondly, two\nnovel algorithms are proposed which exploit this partial de-correlation and\ncollect sensing matrix diversity. Enjoying a low-complexity, these methods do\noffer great practical advantages as they target small measurement size, which\nis indeed severely constrained due to limited coherence time/bandwidth, but\ninstead compensate for it by using a large array of antennas.

It is well-known that many problems in the field of computer vision\nrequire a massive amount of dataset to train deep neural network models. The\nsituation is even worse when it comes to the sign language translation problem\nas it is far more difficult to collect high-quality training data. In this\npaper, we introduce the KETI (short for Korea Electronics Technology Institute)\nsign language dataset which consists of 14,672 videos of high resolution and\nquality. Considering the fact that each country has a different and unique sign\nlanguage, the KETI sign language dataset can be the starting line for further\nresearch on the Korean sign language translation. Using the KETI sign language\ndataset, we develop a neural network model for translating sign videos into\nnatural language sentences by utilizing the human keypoints extracted from a\nface, hands, and body parts. The obtained human keypoint vector is normalized\nby the mean and standard deviation of the keypoints and used as input to our\ntranslation model based on the sequence-to-sequence architecture. As a result,\nwe show that our approach is robust even when the size of the training data is\nnot sufficient. Our translation model achieves 93.28% (55.28%, respectively)\ntranslation accuracy on the validation set (test set, respectively) for 105\nsentences that can be used in emergency situations.

The interplay between disorder and\nordinary tilt generates an effective tilt along the $x$-direction, which is the\nphysically observable one. There exist two types of disorder which increase the\neffective tilt and drive a phase transition from the DSM phase to the diffusive\nmetal phase. The diffusive phase transition stops the increase of the effective\ntilt and the surface of the original Dirac cone in the diffusive metal phase is\njust slightly tilted. Surprisingly, the Dirac point is replaced by a bulk nodal\narc in the diffusive metal phase. The Coulomb interaction suppresses the\ndiffusive phase transition and therefore is harmful to the formation of bulk\nnodal arc. In contrast, there also exists other two types of disorder which\nreduce the effective tilt and induce no phase transition. For these two types\nof disorder, the Coulomb interaction enhances their low-energy relevances.\nCoexistence of Coulomb interaction with any of them leads to a stable infrared\nfixed point where the coupling strengths for two kinds of interaction are\nidentical and the effective tilt vanishes.

The first two settings are a family of AdS3xS7 orientifold vacua and a\nfamily of AdS7xS3 heterotic vacua, supported by form fluxes, with small\nworld-sheet and string-loop corrections within wide ranges of parameters. In\nboth cases we find some unstable scalar perturbations, as a result of mixings\ninduced by fluxes, confirming for the first class of vacua a previous result.\nHowever, in the second class they only affect the l=1 modes, so that a Z2\nprojection induced by an overall internal parity suffices to eliminate them,\nleading to perturbative stability. Moreover, the constant dilaton profiles of\nthese vacua allow one to extend the analysis to generic potentials, thus\nexploring the possible effects of higher-order corrections, and we exhibit wide\nnearby regions of perturbative stability. The solutions in the third setting\nhave nine-dimensional Poincare' symmetry. They include regions with large\nworld-sheet or string-loop corrections, but we show that these vacua have no\nperturbative instabilities. Finally, the last setting concerns cosmological\nsolutions in ten dimensions where the \"climbing\" phenomenon takes place: they\nhave bounded string-loop corrections but large world-sheet ones close to the\ninitial singularity. We find that perturbations generally decay, but\nhomogeneous tensor modes exhibit an interesting logarithmic growth that signals\na breakdown of isotropy. If the Universe then proceeds to lower dimensions,\nmilder potentials from other branes force all perturbations to remain bounded.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2018 08:58:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2019 13:03:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

In this study, we focus on the impact of the Coriolis force on a rotating\nviscosity-stratified flow with a thin diffusive mixed layer between two fluid\nlayers. Modal stability analysis is used to estimate the critical parameters,\nnamely Rotation number, Reynolds number, and wave number, which are responsible\nto modulate the instability mechanism for different viscosity contrasts.\nPresent study explores competing influences of rotational forces against the\nviscous and inertial forces. Correspondingly, rotational direction\n(clockwise/anticlockwise) shows a significant effect on the spatio-temporal\ninstability mechanism and anticlockwise rotation promotes the instability.\nUsually, miscible viscosity stratified flow with respect to streamwise\ndisturbance becomes more unstable for a thinner mixed layer.

A key characteristic shared across such tasks is that\ndifferent positions in a primary instance can benefit from different `experts'\ntrained from auxiliary data, but labeled primary instances are scarce, and\nlabeling the best expert for each position entails unacceptable cognitive\nburden.

We study Einstein manifolds (i.e.,\nmanifolds whose symmetrized Ricci tensor is proportional to the metric) in d\ndimensions with nonvanishing torsion that has both a trace and a traceless\npart, and analyze invariance under extended conformal transformations of the\ncorresponding field equations. Then, we compare our results to the case of\nEinstein manifolds with zero torsion and nonvanishing nonmetricity, where the\nlatter is given in terms of the Weyl vector (Einstein-Weyl spaces). We find\nthat the trace part of the torsion can alternatively be interpreted as the\ntrace part of the nonmetricity. The analysis is subsequently extended to\nEinstein spaces with both torsion and nonmetricity, where we also discuss the\ngeneral setting in which the nonmetricity tensor has both a trace and a\ntraceless part. Moreover, we consider and investigate actions involving scalar\ncurvatures obtained from torsionful or nonmetric connections, analyzing their\nrelations with other gravitational theories that appeared previously in the\nliterature. In particular, we show that the Einstein-Cartan action and the\nscale invariant gravity (also known as conformal gravity) action describe the\nsame dynamics.

The efficiency of strategies for finding optimal\nexperimental set-ups is particularly important for experiments that are\ntime-consuming or expensive to perform. For instance, in the situation when the\nexperiments are modeled by Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), multilevel\nmethods have been proven to dramatically reduce the computational complexity of\ntheir single-level counterparts when estimating expected values. For a setting\nwhere PDEs can model experiments, we propose two multilevel methods for\nestimating a popular design criterion known as the expected information gain in\nsimulation-based Bayesian optimal experimental design. The expected information\ngain criterion is of a nested expectation form, and only a handful of\nmultilevel methods have been proposed for problems of such form. We propose a\nMultilevel Double Loop Monte Carlo (MLDLMC), which is a multilevel strategy\nwith Double Loop Monte Carlo (DLMC), and a Multilevel Double Loop Stochastic\nCollocation (MLDLSC), which performs a high-dimensional integration by\ndeterministic quadrature on sparse grids. For both methods, the Laplace\napproximation is used for importance sampling that significantly reduces the\ncomputational work of estimating inner expectations. The optimal values of the\nmethod parameters are determined by minimizing the average computational work,\nsubject to satisfying the desired error tolerance. The computational\nefficiencies of the methods are demonstrated by estimating the expected\ninformation gain for Bayesian inference of the fiber orientation in composite\nlaminate materials from an electrical impedance tomography experiment.

Our TPC track finding\nleverages the potential of hardware accelerators via the OpenCL and CUDA APIs\nin a shared source code for CPUs, GPUs, and both reconstruction stages. Porting\nmore reconstruction steps like the remainder of the TPC reconstruction and\ntracking for other detectors will shift the computing balance from traditional\nprocessors to GPUs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2018 10:16:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-29"}

During the GRB\nprompt phase, some dissipation processes may happen and disturb the magnetic\nfield, making the field become random to some extent. Therefore, a mixed\nmagnetic field consisting of an ordered component and a random component is\nplausible for the early afterglow phase. Here we investigate the polarization\nevolution and light curve of an afterglow under such a 3-dimensional mixed\nmagnetic field. Three kinds of ordered component (i.e., aligned, toroidal and\nradial) are discussed. We find that the three cases are distinguishable through\njet polarization evolution. The polarization angle for a 3D mixed magnetic\nfield with an aligned ordered component can evolve gradually but only changes\nabruptly by $90^\\circ$ in the toroidal and radial cases. Furthermore, during\nthe reverse shock crossing time, the polarization degree (PD) can be non-zero\nfor the toroidal case but roughly zero for the radial case. Since an aligned\ncomponent in a jet corresponds to a magnetar central engine and a toroidal\ncomponent corresponds to a black hole, GRB central engines are distinguishable\nthrough polarization observations even if the magnetic field is mixed in a jet.\nIn addition, our polarization calculation can be applied to GRB 170817A\nassociated with GW170817. Using the recently-observed PD upper limit $12\\%$ of\nGRB 170817A at $t=244$ days, the magnetic field strength ratio of the ordered\nto random components in this afterglow is constrained to be $\\lesssim0.9$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2018 10:19:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

Each local structure is mapped to the Euclidean\nspace by normalizing the local structure with the number of minutiae that\nassociates to it. This simple yet crucial crux enables fast dissimilarity\ncomputation of two local structures with Euclidean distance without distortion.\nA complementary texture-based local structure to the minutia-based local\nstructure is also introduced whereby both can be compressed via principal\ncomponent analysis and fused easily in the Euclidean space. The fused local\nstructure is then converted to a K-bit ordered string via a K-means clustering\nalgorithm. This chain of computation with sole use of Euclidean distance is\nvital for speedy and discriminative bit-string conversion. The accuracy can be\nfurther improved by a finger-specific bit-training algorithm in which two\ncriteria are leveraged to select useful bit positions for matching.

In the\nfirst part, wormhole solutions are constructed imposing that the radial\npressure admits an equation of state corresponding to a varying Chaplygin gas.\nTwo forms for the varying Chaplygin gas are considered, namely $P_{r} = - B\nb(r)^{u}/\\rho^{\\alpha}$ and $P_{r} = -B R(r)^{m}/ \\rho^{\\alpha }$,\nrespectively. In the second part, the wormhole models are constructed assuming\nthat the radial pressure can be described by a varying barotropic fluid.

In all cases, $b(r)$ is the shape function, and\n$R(r)$ the Ricci scalar obtained from the wormhole metric for a redshift\nfunction equal to $1$. With the help of specific examples, it is demonstrated\nthat the shape functions of the exact wormhole models previously constructed do\nobey the necessary metric conditions. The same energy conditions help reveal\nthe physical properties of these models. A general feature is the violation of\nthe NEC~($\\rho + P_{i} \\geq 0$) in terms of the radial pressure $P_{r}$ at the\nthroat of the wormhole.

Traditional measures\nlike PESQ and STOI for evaluating the speech quality and intelligibility were\nverified to have relatively low correlations with WER. In this study, a novel\nacoustics-guided evaluation (AGE) measure is proposed for estimating\nperformance of SEAs for robust ASR. AGE consists of three consecutive steps,\nnamely the low-level representations via the feature extraction, high-level\nrepresentations via the nonlinear mapping with the acoustic model (AM), and the\nfinal AGE calculation between the representations of clean speech and degraded\nspeech. Specifically, state posterior probabilities from neural network based\nAM are adopted for the high-level representations and the cross-entropy\ncriterion is used to calculate AGE. Experiments demonstrate AGE could yield\nconsistently highest correlations with WER and give the most accurate\nestimation of ASR performance compared with PESQ, STOI, and acoustic confidence\nmeasure using Entropy. Potentially, AGE could be adopted to guide the parameter\noptimization of deep learning based SEAs to further improve the recognition\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2018 12:13:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-29"}

In the latter case, the ongoing transition to\ndistributed renewable energy sources is leading to a proliferation of dynamical\nactors. The desynchronization of a few or even one of those would likely result\nin a substantial blackout. Thus the dynamical stability of the synchronous\nstate has become a focus of power grid research in recent years. In this letter\nwe uncover that the non-linear stability against large perturbations is\ndominated and threatened by the presence of \\textit{solitary states} in which\nindividual actors desynchronise. Remarkably, when taking physical losses in the\nnetwork into account, the back-reaction of the network induces new {\\it exotic}\nsolitary states in the individual actors, and the stability characteristics of\nthe synchronous state are dramatically altered. These novel effects will have\nto be explicitly taken into account in the design of future power grids, and\ntheir existence poses a challenge for control.

This analysis provides algebraic expressions which give instantaneous,\nquantitative information into i) when a studied scheme will predict linear wave\ngrowth, ii) the rate of growth and the expected growing wavelength, and iii)\nthe wave speeds. These stability expressions adhere to a wider family of finite\nvolume methods, directly applicable to any specific formulation within this\ngroup.

We leverage for this a dithered quantized compressive sensing framework\nthat can be applied to classic radar processing and hardware. This allows us to\nremove ambiguous scenarios prohibiting correct range estimation from\n(undithered) quantized base-band radar signal.

The effectiveness of the reconstruction methods combined\nwith the dithering strategy is shown through Monte Carlo simulations.\nFurthermore we show that: (i), in dithered quantization, the accuracy of target\nrange estimation improves when the bit-rate (i.e., the total number of measured\nbits) increases, whereas the accuracy of other undithered schemes saturate in\nthis case; and (ii), for fixed, low bit-rate scenarios, severely quantized\ndithered schemes exhibit better performances than their full resolution\ncounterparts.

This wide transition width is\nan intrinsic feature and does not change with magnetic field. In the high\npressure region above 1.18 GPa, just accompanying the onset of superconducting\ntransition, an upturn of resistivity immediately occurs, which is attributed to\nthe formation of an antiferromagnetic order. This closely attached behavior of\nsuperconductivity and antiferromagnetic order indicates that these two orders\nhave a synergy feature. Near the critical pressure 0.825 GPa and below, our\ndata illustrate that an antiferromagnetic order emerges when superconductivity\nis suppressed. From the weak influence of magnetic field to the\nantiferromagnetic order, we conclude that it exists already below the small\nsuperconducting dome in the low pressure region. This shows a competing feature\nbetween superconductivity and antiferromagnetic order. Our results show duality\nfeatures, namely synergy and competition between superconductivity and\nantiferromagnetic order under pressure in FeSe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2018 14:49:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-06"}

However, real geophysical flows also include\nirreversible processes, such as viscous dissipation, heat conduction, diffusion\nand phase changes. Recent work has demonstrated that the variational\nformulation can be extended to include irreversible processes and\nnon-equilibrium thermodynamics, through the new concept of thermodynamic\ndisplacement. By design, and in accordance with fundamental physical\nprinciples, the resulting equations automatically satisfy the first and second\nlaw of thermodynamics.

Due to their low surface brightnesses and complex\nmorphologies, existing automated methods struggle to detect such features and\nmost work to date has heavily relied on visual inspection. This presents a\nmajor obstacle to quantitative study of tidal debris features in large\nstatistical samples, and hence the ability to be able to use these features to\nadvance understanding of the galaxy population as a whole. This paper uses\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) with dropout and augmentation to identify\ngalaxies in the CFHTLS-Wide Survey that have faint tidal features. Evaluating\nthe performance of the CNNs against previously-published expert visual\nclassifications, we find that our method achieves high (76%) completeness and\nlow (20%) contamination, and also performs considerably better than other\nautomated methods recently applied in the literature. We argue that CNNs offer\na promising approach to effective automatic identification of low surface\nbrightness tidal debris features in and around galaxies. When applied to\nforthcoming deep wide-field imaging surveys (e.g. LSST, Euclid), CNNs have the\npotential to provide a several order-of-magnitude increase in the sample size\nof morphologically-perturbed galaxies and thereby facilitate a much-anticipated\nrevolution in terms of quantitative low surface brightness science.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2018 15:15:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-29"}

Quite some research has been devoted to\ncomparing and indexing time series. Especially, when the comparison should not\nbe affected by time warping, the ubiquitous Dynamic Time Warping distance\nfunction ($\\texttt{DTW}$) is one of the most analyzed time series distance\nfunctions. The Dog-Keeper distance ($\\texttt{DK}$) is another example for a\ndistance function on time series which is truely invariant under time warping.\n  For many application scenarios (e.$\\,$g. motion gesture recognition in\nvirtual reality), the invariance under isometric spatial transformations\n(i.$\\,$e. rotation, translation, and mirroring) is as important as the\ninvariance under time warping. Distance functions on time series which are\ninvariant under isometric transformations can be seen as measurements for the\ncongruency of two time series.

However, it is very hard to compute and\nit is not invariant under time warpings.\n  In this work, we are taking one step towards developing a feasable distance\nfunction which is invariant under isometric spatial transformations and time\nwarping: We develop four approximations for $\\texttt{CD}$.

Such\nmodel works reasonably well in describing the charmonium and bottomonium\nspectroscopy. However, even when there are physically-motivated arguments for\nthe construction of the Cornell model, there is no conection a priori with QCD\nparameters.\n  Based on a previous work on heavy meson spectroscopy, we calibrate the\nCornell model with NRQCD predictions for the lowest lying bottomonium states at\nN$^3$LO, in which the bottom mass is varied within a wide range. We show that\nthe Cornell model mass parameter can be identified with the low-scale\nshort-distance MSR mass at the scale $R = 1$ GeV. This identification holds for\nany value of $\\alpha_s$ or the bottom mass. For moderate values of $r$, the\nNRQCD and Cornell static potentials are in head-on agreement when switching the\npole mass to the MSR scheme, which allows to simultaneously cancel the\nrenormalon and sum up large logarithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Nov 2018 19:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-30"}

The effects\nof purely random perturbations of the background flow are sensitive to the\nphase of the subharmonic component of the perturbation that has a wavelength\ndouble that of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. If the phase relationship\nbetween the Kelvin-Helmholtz mode and its subharmonic mode is optimal, or close\nto it, vortex pairing occurs. Vortex paring is delayed when there is a phase\ndifference, and this delay increases with increasing phase difference. In three\ndimensional simulations vortex pairing is suppressed if the phase difference is\nsufficiently large, reducing the amount of mixing and mixing efficiency. For a\ngiven phase difference close enough to the optimal phase, the response of the\nflow to eigenvalues perturbations is very similar to the response to random\nperturbations.

With the many\nvarieties of AI hardware prevailing on the market, it is often hard to decide\nwhich one is the best to use. Thus, benchmarking AI hardware effectively\nbecomes important and is of great help to select and optimize AI hardware.\nUnfortunately, there are few AI benchmarks available in both academia and\nindustry. Examples are BenchNN[1], DeepBench[2], and Dawn Bench[3], which are\nusually a collection of typical real DNN applications. While these benchmarks\nprovide performance comparison across different AI hardware, they suffer from a\nnumber of drawbacks. First, they cannot adapt to the emerging changes of DNN\nalgorithms and are fixed once selected. Second, they contain tens to hundreds\nof applications and take very long time to finish running. Third, they are\nmainly selected from open sources, which are restricted by copyright and are\nnot representable to proprietary applications. In this work, a synthetic\nbenchmarks framework is firstly proposed to address the above drawbacks of AI\nbenchmarks. Instead of pre-selecting a set of open-sourced benchmarks and\nrunning all of them, the synthetic approach generates only a one or few\nbenchmarks that best represent a broad range of applications using profiled\nworkload characteristics data of these applications. Thus, it can adapt to\nemerging changes of new DNN algorithms by re-profiling new applications and\nupdating itself, greatly reduce benchmark count and running time, and strongly\nrepresent DNN applications of interests. The generated benchmarks are called AI\nMatrix, serving as a performance benchmarks matching the statistical workload\ncharacteristics of a combination of applications of interests.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Nov 2018 19:20:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-04"}

In this paper, we focus on how to solve PJ\npuzzles in the cyberspace by a group of physically distributed human players.\nWe propose an approach to solving PJ puzzle by stigmergy-inspired\nInternet-based human collective intelligence. The core of the approach is a\ncontinuously executing loop, named the EIF loop, which consists of three\nactivities: exploration, integration, and feedback. In exploration, each player\ntries to solve the PJ puzzle alone, without direct interactions with other\nplayers. At any time, the result of a player's exploration is a partial\nsolution to the PJ puzzle, and a set of rejected neighboring relation between\npieces. The results of all players' exploration are integrated in real time\nthrough integration, with the output of a continuously updated collective\nopinion graph (COG). And through feedback, each player is provided with\npersonalized feedback information based on the current COG and the player's\nexploration result, in order to accelerate his/her puzzle-solving process.\nExploratory experiments show that: (1) supported by this approach, the time to\nsolve PJ puzzle is nearly linear to the reciprocal of the number of players,\nand shows better scalability to puzzle size than that of face-to-face\ncollaboration for 10-player groups; (2) for groups with 2 to 10 players, the\npuzzle-solving time decreases 31.36%-64.57% on average, compared with the best\nsingle players in the experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2018 12:07:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 08:58:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-12"}

Inspired by Tsallis' nonextensive formulation of statistical\nphysics, the so-called $q$-distribution is a handy source of self-correlated\nnoise for a large range of applications. The $q$-noise -- which tends smoothly\nfor $q=1$ to Ornstein--Uhlenbeck noise with autocorrelation $\\tau$ -- is\ngenerated via a stochastic differential equation, using the Heun method (a\nsecond order Runge--Kutta type integration scheme). The algorithm is\nimplemented as a stand-alone library in C++, and is made available as open\nsource in the Github repository. Noise' statistics can be specified handily; by\nonly varying parameter $q$: it has compact support for $q<1$ (sub-Gaussian\nregime) and finite variance up to $q=5/3$ (supra-Gaussian regime). Once $q$ is\nfixed, noise' autocorrelation can be tuned independently by means of parameter\n$\\tau$. The presented qNoise generator provides a readily tool to modeling wide\nrange of real-world noise types, and is suitable to study the effects of\ncorrelation and deviations from the normal distribution in systems of\nstochastic differential equations, key to understand system dynamics in\nnumerous applications. The effect of noises' statistics on the response of a\nrange of nonlinear systems is briefly discussed. In many of these examples, the\nsystems' response turns optimal for some $q\\neq1$. Hence, this paper aims to\nintroduce qNoise generator for C++ at the class level and evaluate the kind of\nnoise it generates, alongside their use in a range of applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2018 02:04:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2021 11:25:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-01"}

It follows a bottom-up structure that identifies,\nbased on expert knowledge, biological components related with past and present\nchanging conditions. It is structured in 5 stages that interact in an adaptive\nway: stage 1, in situ observations suggest changes could be happening; stage 2\nexplores available data that represent EI; stage 3, experts' workshops target\nthe identification of the minimum set of variables needed to define EI, or the\nrisk of losing EI; an optative stage 4, where deviance from EI, or risk of\ndeviance, is statistically assessed; stage 5, findings are communicated to\nsociety. We demonstrate the framework effectiveness in three case studies,\nincluding a data poor situation, an area where lack of reference sites hampers\nthe identification of historical changes, and an area where diffuse sources of\nstress make it difficult to identify simple relationships with of ecological\nresponses. The future challenge is to operationalize the approach and trigger\ndesirable society actions to strengthen a social-nature link.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Nov 2018 17:57:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-31"}

Several hypotheses have been posed\nconcerning both structural changes of the ion conducting material and of the\nion conducting mechanism. The posed structural hypotheses are oxygen sub\nlattice melting, phase change of the ion conducting material, and that the\nheterolayer environment does not induce a phase change of the ion conducting\nmaterial. The posed mechanistic hypotheses are disorder, mechanics, and space\ncharge. Here, first principles molecular dynamics and statics of the ion\nconducting interface are performed providing evidence that under CIC conditions\nno sub lattice melting nor phase change has occurred and that the electrolyte\nremains unchanged. A discussion of the posed mechanistic hypotheses is given\nand cast as a series of mathematical statements. When these hypotheses are\ncompared with first principles calculations and literature results, they fail\nto capture CIC; a new alternative dipole hypothesis is offered, which also\nfails to capture CIC; further analysis of the literature points to CIC being an\ninterface mediated phenomenon, similar to grain boundary diffusion, where the\noperando mechanism remain unclear.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2018 00:16:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-04"}
