One of the\ncontributions to the SP signal is the streaming potential, which is of\nparticular interest in hydrogeophysics as it is directly related to both the\nwater flow and porous medium properties. The streaming current is generated by\nthe relative displacement of an excess of electrical charges located in the\nelectrical double layer surrounding the minerals of the porous media. In this\nstudy, we develop a physically based analytical model to estimate the effective\nexcess charge density dragged by the water flow under partially saturated\nconditions. The proposed model is based on the assumption that the porous media\ncan be represented by a bundle of tortuous capillary tubes with a fractal pore\nsize distribution. The excess charge that is effectively dragged by the water\nflow is estimated using a flux averaging approach. Under these hypotheses, this\nnew model describes the effective excess charge density as a function of\nsaturation and relative permeability while also depending on the chemical and\ninterface properties, and on petrophysical parameters of the media. The\nexpression of the model has an analytical single closed-form which is\nconsistent with a previous model developed from a different approach. The\nperformance of the proposed model is then tested against previous models and\ndifferent sets of laboratory and field data from the literature. The\npredictions of the proposed model fits fairly well the experimental data and\nshows improvements to estimate the magnitude of the effective excess charge\ndensity over the previous models.

Dyslexia has been frequently linked to cerebral\ncortex alterations; however recent evidence also points towards sensory\nthalamus dysfunctions: dyslexics showed reduced responses in the left auditory\nthalamus (medial geniculate body, MGB) during speech processing in contrast to\nneurotypical readers. In addition, in the visual modality, dyslexics have\nreduced structural connectivity between the left visual thalamus (lateral\ngeniculate nucleus, LGN) and V5/MT, a cerebral cortex region involved in visual\nmovement processing. Higher LGN-V5/MT connectivity in dyslexics was associated\nwith the faster rapid naming of letters and numbers (RANln), a measure that is\nhighly correlated with reading proficiency. We here tested two hypotheses that\nwere directly derived from these previous findings. First, we tested the\nhypothesis that dyslexics have reduced structural connectivity between the left\nMGB and the auditory motion-sensitive part of the left planum temporale (mPT).\nSecond, we hypothesized that the amount of left mPT-MGB connectivity correlates\nwith dyslexics RANln scores.

Stronger left mPT-MGB connectivity was not associated with\nfaster RANnl scores in dyslexics, but in neurotypical readers.

A reason is that they treat all images and faces\nequally, without putting more effort on hard ones; however, many training\nimages only contain easy faces, which are less helpful to achieve better\nperformance on hard images. In this paper, we propose that the robustness of a\nface detector against hard faces can be improved by learning small faces on\nhard images. Our intuitions are (1) hard images are the images which contain at\nleast one hard face, thus they facilitate training robust face detectors; (2)\nmost hard faces are small faces and other types of hard faces can be easily\nconverted to small faces by shrinking. We build an anchor-based deep face\ndetector, which only output a single feature map with small anchors, to\nspecifically learn small faces and train it by a novel hard image mining\nstrategy. Extensive experiments have been conducted on WIDER FACE, FDDB, Pascal\nFaces, and AFW datasets to show the effectiveness of our method.

These debates rarely engage with how racial identity is embedded in\nour social experience, making for sociological and psychological complexity.\nThis complexity challenges the paradigm of considering fairness to be a formal\nproperty of supervised learning with respect to protected personal attributes.\nRacial identity is not simply a personal subjective quality. For people labeled\n\"Black\" it is an ascribed political category that has consequences for social\ndifferentiation embedded in systemic patterns of social inequality achieved\nthrough both social and spatial segregation. In the United States, racial\nclassification can best be understood as a system of inherently unequal status\ncategories that places whites as the most privileged category while signifying\nthe Negro/black category as stigmatized. Social stigma is reinforced through\nthe unequal distribution of societal rewards and goods along racial lines that\nis reinforced by state, corporate, and civic institutions and practices. This\ncreates a dilemma for society and designers: be blind to racial group\ndisparities and thereby reify racialized social inequality by no longer\nmeasuring systemic inequality, or be conscious of racial categories in a way\nthat itself reifies race. We propose a third option. By preceding group\nfairness interventions with unsupervised learning to dynamically detect\npatterns of segregation, machine learning systems can mitigate the root cause\nof social disparities, social segregation and stratification, without further\nanchoring status categories of disadvantage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2018 16:47:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-29"}

We describe our code and demonstrate\nits use on three example systems; a molecule (nitric oxide), a model solid (the\nuniform electron gas), and a real solid (diamond). An illustrative tutorial is\nalso included.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2018 17:01:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2018 19:27:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-19"}

Neural networks trained by stochastic gradient descent often\ndegrade on old tasks when trained successively on new tasks with different data\ndistributions. This phenomenon, referred to as catastrophic forgetting, is\nconsidered a major hurdle to learning with non-stationary data or sequences of\nnew tasks, and prevents networks from continually accumulating knowledge and\nskills. We examine this issue in the context of reinforcement learning, in a\nsetting where an agent is exposed to tasks in a sequence. Unlike most other\nwork, we do not provide an explicit indication to the model of task boundaries,\nwhich is the most general circumstance for a learning agent exposed to\ncontinuous experience. While various methods to counteract catastrophic\nforgetting have recently been proposed, we explore a straightforward, general,\nand seemingly overlooked solution - that of using experience replay buffers for\nall past events - with a mixture of on- and off-policy learning, leveraging\nbehavioral cloning. We show that this strategy can still learn new tasks\nquickly yet can substantially reduce catastrophic forgetting in both Atari and\nDMLab domains, even matching the performance of methods that require task\nidentities.

Eternal inflation is a phase of infinite\nself-reproduction of a quasi-de Sitter universe which has been argued to be a\ngeneric consequence of cosmological inflation. The originally proposed de\nSitter swampland conjectures were shown by Matsui and Takahashi and by\nDimopoulos to be generically incompatible with eternal inflation. However, the\nmore recently proposed \"refined\" swampland conjecture imposes a slightly weaker\ncriterion on the scalar field potential in inflation, and is consistent with\nthe existence of a tachyonic instability. In this paper, I show that eternal\ninflation is marginally consistent with the refined de Sitter swampland\nconjecture. Thus, if the refined conjecture is correct, the existence of a\nlandscape-based \"multiverse\" in string theory is not incompatible with a\nself-consistent ultraviolet completion, with significant consequences for model\nbuilding in string theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2018 17:36:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Nov 2018 10:24:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-06"}

In the vertex-weighted\nSteiner tree (VST) problem, each vertex is assigned a non-negative weight, and\nthe goal is to compute a minimum weight Steiner tree of $G$.\n  We study a natural generalization of the VST problem motivated by multi-level\ngraph construction, the \\emph{vertex-weighted grade-of-service Steiner tree\nproblem} (V-GSST), which can be stated as follows: given a graph $G$ and\nterminals $T$, where each terminal $v \\in T$ requires a facility of a minimum\ngrade of service $R(v)\\in \\{1,2,\\ldots\\ell\\}$, compute a Steiner tree $G'$ by\ninstalling facilities on a subset of vertices, such that any two vertices\nrequiring a certain grade of service are connected by a path in $G'$ with the\nminimum grade of service or better. Facilities of higher grade are more costly\nthan facilities of lower grade. Multi-level variants such as this one can be\nuseful in network design problems where vertices may require facilities of\nvarying priority.\n  While similar problems have been studied in the edge-weighted case, they have\nnot been studied as well in the more general vertex-weighted case. We first\ndescribe a simple heuristic for the V-GSST problem whose approximation ratio\ndepends on $\\ell$, the number of grades of service. We then generalize the\ngreedy algorithm of [Klein \\& Ravi, 1995] to show that the V-GSST problem\nadmits a $(2 \\ln |T|)$-approximation, where $T$ is the set of terminals\nrequiring some facility. This result is surprising, as it shows that the\n(seemingly harder) multi-grade problem can be approximated as well as the VST\nproblem, and that the approximation ratio does not depend on the number of\ngrades of service.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2018 17:37:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 May 2019 23:02:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-07"}

Its\nHamiltonian inside the BH, when written in the PG reference frame, is identical\nto the Hamiltonian of the electronic quasiparticles in type~II Weyl semimetals\n(WSII) that reside in the vicinity of a type~II Weyl point. When these\nmaterials are in the equilibrium state, the type II Weyl point becomes the\ncrossing point of the two pieces of the Fermi surface called Fermi pockets. {It\nwas previously stated} that there should be a Fermi surface inside a black hole\nin equilibrium.

A good agreement has been\nobserved between experiments and simulations in terms of the overall pressure\ndrop, concentration distribution and turbulent statistics of the two phases.\nAdditional experimental results considering two particle sizes, $2H/d_p$ = 14.5\nand 9 and multiple $\\Phi$ = 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5% are reported at the same\n$Re_{2H}$. The pressure drop monotonically increases with the volume fraction,\nalmost linearly and nearly independently of the particle size for the above\nparameters.

In order to store and process such a data deluge,\ntoday's DCNs have to deploy enormous length of wires to interconnect a plethora\nof servers and switches. Unfortunately, wired DCNs with uniform and inflexible\nlink capacities expose several drawbacks such as high cabling cost and\ncomplexity, low space utilization, and lack of bandwidth efficiency. Wireless\nDCNs (WDCNs) have emerged as a promising solution to reduce the time, effort,\nand cost spent on deploying and maintaining the wires. Thanks to its\nreconfigurability and flexibility, WDCNs can deliver higher throughputs by\nefficiently utilizing the bandwidth and mitigate the chronic DCN problems of\noversubscription and hotspots. Moreover, wireless links enhance the\nfault-tolerance and energy efficiency by eliminating the need for error-prone\npower-hungry switches. Accordingly, this paper first compares virtues and\ndrawbacks of millimeter wave (mmWave), terahertz (THz), and optical wireless\ncommunications as potential candidates. Thereafter, an in-depth discussion on\nadvances and challenges in WDCNs is provided including physical and virtual\ntopology design, quality of service (QoS) provisioning, flow classification,\ndata grooming, and load balancing.

The recent detection of associated H-alpha emission and\nsimilar abrupt variations in the Ly-alpha kinematics, strongly suggest that the\nHeII/Ly-alpha gradient is due to large variations in the physical distances\nbetween the associated quasar and these regions. This implies that the overall\nlength of the emitting structure could extend to physical Mpc scales and be\nmostly oriented along our line of sight.

Thus, young M-type stars are prime targets for\nisochronal dating, especially in young moving groups (YMGs), which contain\nlarge amounts of stars in this mass and age range. If the mass and luminosity\nof a star can both be directly determined, this allows for a particularly\nrobust isochronal analysis. This motivates in-depth studies of low-mass\nbinaries with spatially resolvable orbits, where dynamical masses can be\nderived. Here we present the results of an observing campaign dedicated to\norbital monitoring of AB Dor Ba/Bb, which is a close M-dwarf pair within the\nquadruple AB Dor system. We have acquired eight astrometric epochs with the\nSPHERE/ZIMPOL and NACO instruments, which we combine with literature data to\nimprove the robustness and precision for the orbital characterization of the\npair.

These measurements are combined with other YMG pairs in the\nliterature to start building a framework of empirical isochrones in\nmass-luminosity space. This can be used to calibrate theoretical isochrones and\nto provide a model-free basis for assessing relative stellar ages. We note a\ntentative emerging trend where the youngest moving group members are largely\nconsistent with theoretical expectations, while stars in older associations\nsuch as the AB Dor moving group appear to be systematically underluminous\nrelative to isochronal expectations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2018 19:50:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-09"}

In this paper we present an\napproach which learns from a small training dataset of annotated semantic\nparts, where the object is seen from a limited range of viewpoints, but\ngeneralizes to detect semantic parts from a much larger range of viewpoints.\nOur approach is based on a matching algorithm for finding accurate spatial\ncorrespondence between two images, which enables semantic parts annotated on\none image to be transplanted to another. In particular, this enables images in\nthe training dataset to be matched to a virtual 3D model of the object (for\nsimplicity, we assume that the object viewpoint can be estimated by standard\ntechniques). Then a clustering algorithm is used to annotate the semantic parts\nof the 3D virtual model. This virtual 3D model can be used to synthesize\nannotated images from a large range of viewpoint. These can be matched to\nimages in the test set, using the same matching algorithm, to detect semantic\nparts in novel viewpoints of the object.

To this\nend, this paper presents a survey and framework intended to share knowledge and\nexperiences of XAI design and evaluation methods across multiple disciplines.\nAiming to support diverse design goals and evaluation methods in XAI research,\nafter a thorough review of XAI related papers in the fields of machine\nlearning, visualization, and human-computer interaction, we present a\ncategorization of interpretable machine learning design goals and evaluation\nmethods to show a mapping between design goals for different XAI user groups\nand their evaluation methods. From our findings, we develop a framework with\nstep-by-step design guidelines paired with evaluation methods to close the\niterative design and evaluation cycles in multidisciplinary XAI teams. Further,\nwe provide summarized ready-to-use tables of evaluation methods and\nrecommendations for different goals in XAI research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2018 21:20:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2018 16:09:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 7 Dec 2019 07:49:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 26 Apr 2020 20:55:35 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 5 Aug 2020 07:31:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-06"}

The aim of this study is to investigate the\nfeasibility of automatically segmenting lumbosacral structures (e.g. nerves &\nbone) on non-contrast CT with deep learning. Methods: a total of 50 cases with\nspinal CT were manually labeled for lumbosacral nerves and bone with Slicer\n4.8. The ratio of training: validation: testing is 32:8:10.

However, meteoroids like 2018 LA and its forerunners, 2008 TC3 and 2014\nAA, are perhaps fragments of larger members of the near-Earth object (NEO)\npopulation. As the processes leading to the production of such fragments are\nunlikely to spawn just one meteoroid per event, it is important to identify\nputative siblings and plausible candidates from which the observed meteoroids\nmight have originated.\n  Aims.

In other words, only classical signature schemes\nexist.\n  We then show a positive result: a quantum state can be signed with the same\nsecurity guarantees as classically, provided that it is also encrypted with the\npublic key of the intended recipient. Following classical nomenclature, we call\nthis notion quantum signcryption. Classically, signcryption is only interesting\nif it provides superior performance to encypt-then-sign. Quantumly, it is far\nmore interesting: it is the only signing method available. We develop\n\"as-strong-as-classical\" security definitions for quantum signcryption and give\nsecure constructions based on post-quantum public-key primitives.

However, the images from such\ndevices generally have a small field of view (FOV) and image quality\ndegradations, making matching difficult. In this work, we develop an efficient\nand accurate retinal matching technique that combines dimension reduction and\nmutual information (MI), called RetinaMatch. The dimension reduction\ninitializes the MI optimization as a coarse localization process, which narrows\nthe optimization domain and avoids local optima. The effectiveness of\nRetinaMatch is demonstrated on the open fundus image database STARE with\nsimulated reduced FOV and anticipated degradations, and on retinal images\nacquired by adapter-based optics attached to a smartphone. RetinaMatch achieves\na success rate over 94\\% on human retinal images with the matched target\nregistration errors below 2 pixels on average, excluding the observer\nvariability. It outperforms the standard template matching solutions. In the\napplication of measuring vessel diameter repeatedly, single pixel errors are\nexpected. In addition, our method can be used in the process of image\nmosaicking with area-based registration, providing a robust approach when the\nfeature based methods fail. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\ntemplate matching algorithm for retina images with small template images from\nunconstrained retinal areas. In the context of the emerging mixed reality\nmarket, we envision automated retinal image matching and registration methods\nas transformative for advanced teleophthalmology and long-term retinal\nmonitoring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2018 23:06:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-30"}

Despite its popularity we are still unable to\naccurately predict the time it will take to train a deep learning network to\nsolve a given problem. This training time can be seen as the product of the\ntraining time per epoch and the number of epochs which need to be performed to\nreach the desired level of accuracy. Some work has been carried out to predict\nthe training time for an epoch -- most have been based around the assumption\nthat the training time is linearly related to the number of floating point\noperations required. However, this relationship is not true and becomes\nexacerbated in cases where other activities start to dominate the execution\ntime.

These regimes are determined by the relative locations of\nthe Fluid Roche Limit, the synchronous orbit, and the location of the maximum\norbit that Lindblad torques can perturb a satellite.

It opens up the exciting possibility of detecting and\ncharacterizing magnetic fields and grain growth in disks around young stellar\nobjects. However, to use polarization for probing the disk properties, its\nproduction mechanism must be ascertained first. To date, the conventional\nmechanism involving magnetically aligned grains fails to explain the\npolarization patterns detected in most disks. This is especially true for the\ninclined disk of HL Tau in ALMA Band 3 (wavelength $\\sim 3$ mm), which has an\nelliptical polarization pattern. The elliptical pattern was taken as evidence\nfor polarized emission by dust grains aligned with their long axes\nperpendicular the direction of the radiative flux. We show that the radiatively\naligned grains produce a circular, rather than elliptical, polarization pattern\neven in inclined disks such as HL Tau. An elliptical polarization pattern can\nbe produced if the grains are aligned aerodynamically by the difference in\nrotation speed between the dust and gas through the Gold mechanism. However, a\nstrong azimuthal variation in polarized intensity is expected for both the\nradiative and aerodynamic alignment, but not observed in the HL Tau disk in\nALMA Band 3. We conclude that neither of these two mechanisms alone can explain\nthe data and the origin of the 3 mm polarization remains a mystery.

Subsequent characterization of the\nmass-dependence of this behavior up to the age of the Sun led to the advent of\ngyrochronology, which uses the rotation rate of a star to infer its age from an\nempirical calibration. The efficacy of the method relies on predictable angular\nmomentum loss from a stellar wind entrained in the large-scale magnetic field\nproduced by global dynamo action. Recent observational evidence suggests that\nthe global dynamo begins to shut down near the middle of a star's main-sequence\nlifetime, leading to a disruption in the production of large-scale magnetic\nfield, a dramatic reduction in angular momentum loss, and a breakdown of\ngyrochronology relations. For solar-type stars this transition appears to occur\nnear the age of the Sun, when rotation becomes too slow to imprint Coriolis\nforces on the global convective patterns, reducing the shear induced by\ndifferential rotation, and disrupting the large-scale dynamo. We use data from\nBarnes (2007) to reveal the signature of this transition in the observations\nthat were originally used to validate gyrochronology. We propose that\nchromospheric activity may ultimately provide a more reliable age indicator for\nolder stars, and we suggest that asteroseismology can be used to help calibrate\nactivity-age relations for field stars beyond the middle of their main-sequence\nlifetimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Nov 2018 01:15:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Dec 2018 17:33:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-01"}

The imaging\nobservations, extrapolated 3D fields, and Q maps on November 17 show that there\nindeed exists an SFS surrounded by a QSL, which is enveloped by another\nQSL-halo corresponding to the overlying larger domeshaped fan. Moreover, the\nmaterial flows caused by the null-point reconnection are also detected along\nthis SFS. After checking the evolution of the underneath magnetic fields, we\nsuggest that the continuous emergence of magnetic flux within the central\nparasitic region encompassed by the opposite-polarity fields results in the\nformation of the SFS under the large fan.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Nov 2018 02:49:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

There are performance\nlimitations of just using RELU. In order to achieve better classification\nperformance, reduce training and testing times, and reduce power consumption\nand memory usage, a new \"Compressed Multi-function CNN\" is developed. Google's\nInception-V4, for example, is a very deep CNN that consists of 4 Inception-A\nblocks, 7 Inception-B blocks, and 3 Inception-C blocks. RELU is used for all\nconvolutional layers. A new \"Compressed Multi-function Inception-V4\" (CMI) that\ncan use different activation functions is created with k Inception-A blocks, m\nInception-B blocks, and n Inception-C blocks where k in {1, 2, 3, 4}, m in {1,\n2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, n in {1, 2, 3}, and (k+m+n)<14. For performance analysis, a\ndataset for classifying brain MRI images into one of the four stages of\nAlzheimer's disease is used to compare three CMI architectures with\nInception-V4 in terms of F1-score, training and testing times (related to power\nconsumption), and memory usage (model size).

It is shown that the direction of phonon transport in the non-linear\nregime is different in the two cases since the first case facilitates the\naccumulation of phonons in the dot and the second case leads to the absorption\nof phonons in the dot. In the linear regime, both the phonon and electronic\ntransport get decoupled and Onsager's symmetry is verified.

In this paper, we\nrepresent skeletons naturally on graphs, and propose a graph regression based\nGCN (GR-GCN) for skeleton-based action recognition, aiming to capture the\nspatio-temporal variation in the data. As the graph representation is crucial\nto graph convolution, we first propose graph regression to statistically learn\nthe underlying graph from multiple observations. In particular, we provide\nspatio-temporal modeling of skeletons and pose an optimization problem on the\ngraph structure over consecutive frames, which enforces the sparsity of the\nunderlying graph for efficient representation. The optimized graph not only\nconnects each joint to its neighboring joints in the same frame strongly or\nweakly, but also links with relevant joints in the previous and subsequent\nframes. We then feed the optimized graph into the GCN along with the\ncoordinates of the skeleton sequence for feature learning, where we deploy\nhigh-order and fast Chebyshev approximation of spectral graph convolution.\nFurther, we provide analysis of the variation characterization by the Chebyshev\napproximation. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed\ngraph regression and show that the proposed GR-GCN achieves the\nstate-of-the-art performance on the widely used NTU RGB+D, UT-Kinect and SYSU\n3D datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Nov 2018 08:36:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Apr 2019 05:33:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-16"}

Different from the traditional regression based methods, the Grid\nR-CNN captures the spatial information explicitly and enjoys the position\nsensitive property of fully convolutional architecture. Instead of using only\ntwo independent points, we design a multi-point supervision formulation to\nencode more clues in order to reduce the impact of inaccurate prediction of\nspecific points. To take the full advantage of the correlation of points in a\ngrid, we propose a two-stage information fusion strategy to fuse feature maps\nof neighbor grid points. The grid guided localization approach is easy to be\nextended to different state-of-the-art detection frameworks. Grid R-CNN leads\nto high quality object localization, and experiments demonstrate that it\nachieves a 4.1% AP gain at IoU=0.8 and a 10.0% AP gain at IoU=0.9 on COCO\nbenchmark compared to Faster R-CNN with Res50 backbone and FPN architecture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Nov 2018 09:20:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-30"}

It achieves these goals by introducing new inputs,\ncalled key inputs, and additional logic to an IC such that the circuit produces\nthe correct output only when the key inputs are set to specific values. The\ncorrect values of the key inputs are kept secret from the untrusted foundry and\nprogrammed after manufacturing and before distribution, rendering piracy,\ncounterfeiting and malicious design changes infeasible. The security of logic\nlocking relies on the assumption that the untrusted foundry cannot infer the\ncorrect values of the key inputs by analysis of the circuit.\n  This paper proposes Functional Analysis attacks on Logic Locking algorithms\n(abbreviated as FALL attacks). FALL attacks have two stages. Their first stage\nis dependent on the locking algorithm and involves analyzing structural and\nfunctional properties of locked circuits to identify a list of potential\nlocking keys. The second stage is algorithm agnostic and introduces a powerful\naddition to SAT-based attacks called key confirmation. Key confirmation can\nidentify the correct key from a list of alternatives and works even on circuits\nthat are resilient to the SAT attack. In comparison to past work, the FALL\nattack is more practical as it can often succeed (90% of successful attempts in\nour experiments) by only analyzing the locked netlist, without requiring oracle\naccess to an unlocked circuit. Our experimental evaluation shows that FALL\nattacks are able to defeat 65 out of 80 (81%) circuits locked using\nStripped-Functionality Logic Locking (SFLL-HD).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Nov 2018 12:07:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Jul 2019 13:04:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 10 Jan 2020 18:15:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-20"}

Previous studies have reported an experimental observation of\nthe spectral gap of SAW on LAPD (Zhang et al 2008 Phys. Plasmas 15 012103), a\nlinear large plasma device (Gekelman et al 1991 Rev. Sci. Instrum. 62 2875)\npossessing easier diagnostic access and lower cost compared with traditional\nfusion devices, and analytical theory and numerical gap eigenmode using ideal\nconditions (Chang 2014 PhD Thesis at Australian National University). To guide\nexperimental implementation, the present work models the gap eigenmode of SAW\nusing exact LAPD parameters. A full picture of the wave field for previous\nexperiment reveals that the previously observed spectral gap is not global but\nan axially local result. To form a global spectral gap, the number of magnetic\nmirrors has to be increased and stronger static magnetic field makes it more\nclear. Such a spectral gap is obtained for the magnetic field of\n$B_0(z)=1.2+0.6\\cos[2\\pi (z-33.68)/3.63]$ with $7.74$~m magnetic beach. By\nintroducing two types of local defects (corresponding to $E_\\theta(z_0)=0$ and\n$E_\\theta'(z_0)=0$ respectively), odd-parity and even-parity discrete\neigenmodes are formed clearly inside the gap. The strength of these gap\neigenmodes decreases significantly with collision frequency, which is\nconsistent with previous studies. Parameter scans show that these gap\neigenmodes can be even formed successfully for the field strength of\n$B_0(z)=0.2+0.1\\cos[2\\pi (z-33.68)/3.63]$ and with only $4$ magnetic mirrors,\nwhich are achievable by LAPD at its present status.

Here the virialization process is naturally\nachieved by introducing shear and rotation instead of using the virial theorem.\nWe generalise two approaches proposed in the literature and show that,\nregardless of the dark-energy model, the new virialization term can be\ncalibrated on the peculiar velocity of the shell as measured from Einstein-de\nSitter simulations. The two virialization recipes qualitatively reproduce the\nfeatures of the ordinary SCM, i.e., a constant $\\Delta_{\\rm vir}$ for the EdS\nmodel and time-variation for dark-energy models, but without any mass\ndependence. Depending on the actual description of virialization and on the\ndark-energy model, the value of $\\Delta_{\\rm vir}$ varies between 10 and 40\npercent.

Moreover,\nrunaway heating of the ion occurs if the buffer gas particles are sufficiently\nheavy relative to the ion.

First,\nto capture the promising possible global optimal region, searching for the\nglobal optimum with genetic algorithm (GA) based on the current surrogate\nmodels of the objective and constraint functions. Second, to infill samples in\nthe region with sparse samples to improve the global accuracy of the surrogate\nmodels, a grid searching with Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) with the current\nsurrogate model is adopted to explore the sample space. Third, to accelerate\nthe local searching efficiency, searching for a local optimum with sequential\nquadratic programming (SQP) based on the local surrogate models in the reduced\ninterval, which involves some samples near the current optimum. When the new\nsample is too close to the existing ones, the new sample should be abandoned,\ndue to the poor additional information.

This in turn allows us to\nrestore a single image of higher quality from a sequence of low quality images\nas the solution of an optimization problem. Inspired by an extension of the\ngradient descent method that can handle non-smooth functions, namely the\nproximal gradient descent, and modern deep learning techniques, we propose a\nconvolutional iterative network with a transparent architecture.

To achieve this, learning\nstable multi-modal representations for both domain-variant (i.e., style) and\ndomain-invariant (i.e., content) information of music in an unsupervised manner\nis critical. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised music style transfer\nmethod without the need for parallel data. Besides, to characterize the\nmulti-modal distribution of music pieces, we employ the Multi-modal\nUnsupervised Image-to-Image Translation (MUNIT) framework in the proposed\nsystem. This allows one to generate diverse outputs from the learned latent\ndistributions representing contents and styles. Moreover, to better capture the\ngranularity of sound, such as the perceptual dimensions of timbre and the\nnuance in instrument-specific performance, cognitively plausible features\nincluding mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), spectral difference, and\nspectral envelope, are combined with the widely-used mel-spectrogram into a\ntimber-enhanced multi-channel input representation. The Relativistic average\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (RaGAN) is also utilized to achieve fast\nconvergence and high stability. We conduct experiments on bilateral style\ntransfer tasks among three different genres, namely piano solo, guitar solo,\nand string quartet. Results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method\nin music style transfer with improved sound quality and in allowing users to\nmanipulate the output.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2018 18:42:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-30"}

Importantly in the context of MOND, they have the lowest internal\naccelerations reachable inside galactic systems. I analyze a sample of 56\nmedium-richness groups having a large number ($\\ge 15$) of members with\nmeasured velocities. The groups obey the deep-MOND,\nbaryonic-mass-velocity-dispersion relation, $M_MGa_0=(81/4)\\sigma^4$, with\nindividual, MOND $M_M/L_K$ ratios of order $1$ solar unit, with\n$(M_M/L_K)_{median}=0.7$ s.u. compared with the much larger Newtonian $M_d/L_K$\n-- several tens s.u., and $(M_d/L_K)_{median}=37$ s.u. The same MOND relation\ndescribes dwarf spheroidals -- 2-3 orders smaller in size, and 7-8 orders lower\nin mass. The groups conformation to the MOND relation is equivalent to their\nlying on the deep-MOND branch of the `acceleration-discrepancy relation',\n$g\\approx (g_N a_0)^{1/2}$, for $g$ as low as a few percents of $a_0$ ($g_N$ is\nthe baryonic, Newtonian, gravitational acceleration, and $g$ the actual one).\nThis argues against a breakdown of MOND at extremely low accelerations. This\nconformation also argues against the hypothesis that the remaining MOND\nconundrum in cluster cores bespeaks a breakdown of MOND on large-distance\nscales; our groups are as large as cluster cores, but do not show obvious\ndisagreement with MOND.

More precisely, the skip-gram version of word2vec is used to\nmodel slices of music from a large corpus spanning eight musical genres. In\nthis newly learned vector space, a metric based on cosine distance is able to\ndistinguish between functional chord relationships, as well as harmonic\nassociations in the music. Evidence, based on cosine distance between\nchord-pair vectors, suggests that an implicit circle-of-fifths exists in the\nvector space. In addition, a comparison between pieces in different keys\nreveals that key relationships are represented in word2vec space. These results\nsuggest that the newly learned embedded vector representation does in fact\ncapture tonal and harmonic characteristics of music, without receiving explicit\ninformation about the musical content of the constituent slices. In order to\ninvestigate whether proximity in the discovered space of embeddings is\nindicative of `semantically-related' slices, we explore a music generation\ntask, by automatically replacing existing slices from a given piece of music\nwith new slices. We propose an algorithm to find substitute slices based on\nspatial proximity and the pitch class distribution inferred in the chosen\nsubspace. The results indicate that the size of the subspace used has a\nsignificant effect on whether slices belonging to the same key are selected. In\nsum, the proposed word2vec model is able to learn music-vector embeddings that\ncapture meaningful tonal and harmonic relationships in music, thereby providing\na useful tool for exploring musical properties and comparisons across pieces,\nas a potential input representation for deep learning models, and as a music\ngeneration device.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Nov 2018 13:52:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-03"}

This diffusion GN collects the diversity of temporalspatial\ninformation over the network, which is used on local updates. In order to\naddress the challenges on convergence analysis, we firstly consider to form a\nglobal recursion relation over spatial and temporal scales since the\ntraditional GN is a time iterative method and the network-wide NLLS need to be\nsolved. Secondly, the derived recursion related to the networkwide deviation\nbetween the successive two iterations is ambiguous due to the uncertainty of\ndescent discrepancy in GN update step between two versions of cooperation and\nnon-cooperation. Thus, an important work is to derive the boundedness\nconditions of this discrepancy.

In the classical bin packing problem, a given set of\ncuboid-shaped items should be packed into bins with given and fixed-sizes\n(length, width and height) to minimize the number of bins that are used.\nHowever, a novel bin design problem is proposed in this paper. The decision\nvariables are the geometric sizes of bins, and the objective is to minimize the\ntotal surface area. To solve the problem, a low computational-complexity,\nhigh-performance heuristic algorithm based on dynamic programming and\ndepth-first tree search, named DPTS, is developed. Based on real historical\ndata that are collected from logistics scenario, numerical experiments show\nthat the DPTS out-performed 5.8% than the greedy local search (GLS) algorithm\nin the total cost. What's more, DPTS algorithm requires only about 1/50 times\nof the computational resources compared to the GLS algorithm. This demonstrates\nthat DPTS algorithm is very efficient in bin design problem and can help\nlogistics companies to make appropriate design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Nov 2018 05:26:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-10"}

It is known that a\nquiescent, deterministic system possessing a supercritical Hopf bifurcation is\nmore sensitive to sinusoidal stimuli the closer it operates to the bifurcation.\nTo understand signal detection in many natural settings, however, noise must be\ntaken into account. We study the Fokker-Planck equation describing the\nsinusoidally forced dynamics of a noisy supercritical or subcritical Hopf\noscillator. To distinguish an oscillator's motion owing to sinusoidal forcing\nfrom that provoked by noise, we employ the phase-locked amplitude and vector\nstrength, which are zero in the absence of an external signal. The phase-locked\namplitude and entrainment to frequency-detuned forcing but not resonant forcing\npeak as functions of the control parameter. These peaks occur near but not at\nthe bifurcations. Moreover, an oscillator can detect stimuli over the broadest\nfrequency range when it spontaneously oscillates near a Hopf bifurcation.\nAlthough noise exerts the greatest effect on the phase-locked amplitude when a\nHopf oscillator is near a Hopf bifurcation, the oscillator nevertheless\nperforms best as a sinusoidal-signal detector when it operates close to the\nbifurcation. The oscillator's ability to differentiate detuned signals from\nnoise is greatest with it autonomously oscillates near to but not at the\nbifurcation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2018 21:33:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-20"}

DDVFA consists of a global ART system whose nodes are local\nfuzzy ART modules. It is equipped with the distinctive features of distributed\nhigher-order activation and match functions, using dual vigilance parameters\nresponsible for cluster similarity and data quantization. Together, these allow\nDDVFA to perform unsupervised modularization, create multi-prototype clustering\nrepresentations, retrieve arbitrarily-shaped clusters, and control its\ncompactness. Another important contribution is the reduction of\norder-dependence, an issue that affects any agglomerative clustering method.\nThis paper demonstrates two approaches for mitigating order-dependence:\npreprocessing using visual assessment of cluster tendency (VAT) or\npostprocessing using a novel Merge ART module. The former is suitable for batch\nprocessing, whereas the latter can be used in online learning. Experimental\nresults in the online learning mode carried out on 30 benchmark data sets show\nthat DDVFA cascaded with Merge ART statistically outperformed the best other\nART-based systems when samples were randomly presented. Conversely, they were\nfound to be statistically equivalent in the offline mode when samples were\npre-processed using VAT. Remarkably, performance comparisons to non-ART-based\nclustering algorithms show that DDVFA (which learns incrementally) was also\nstatistically equivalent to the non-incremental (offline) methods of DBSCAN,\nsingle linkage hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC), and k-means, while\nretaining the appealing properties of ART.
