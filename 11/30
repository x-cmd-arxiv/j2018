For the first time, we\npresent a systematic search for a former companion to the Vela supernova, and\nrule out essentially any surviving luminous ($>L_\\odot$) companion. Based on\nparallax and proper motion, we identify a faint source (Star A; Gaia Source ID\n5521955992667891584) which is kinematically consistent with being a former\nbinary companion to the Vela SN progenitor. However, the inferred absolute\nmagnitude of this source is extremely faint, raising the possibility that it\nmay in fact be a background interloper. In addition, we derive a new distance\n($3.37^{+4.04}_{-0.97}$ kpc) to the Crab SN based on the Gaia parallax\nmeasurements, which is significantly further than the 2 kpc distance typically\nadopted. Finally, we demonstrate that Gaia can be used to measure the secular\ndecline in the luminosity of the Crab pulsar, and provide a new test of pulsar\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Nov 2018 16:03:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-30"}

Our second contribution is a fast\nalgorithm for minimizing our generalized objective function, based on a variant\nof the push-relabel algorithm for computing preflows. We make our approach very\nfast in practice by implementing a global relabeling heuristic and employing a\nwarm-start procedure to quickly solve related cut problems.

Testing these ideas\nexperimentally has, so far, been impractical because the putative flux of\nHawking radiation from astrophysical BHs is too small to be distinguished from\nthe rest of the hot environment. Here, it is proposed that the spectrum of\nemitted gravitational waves (GWs) after the merger of two BHs, in particular\nthe spectrum of GW150914, can be used to infer a lower limit on the magnitude\nof the entropy of the post-merger BH. This lower bound is potentially\nsignificant as it could be of the same order as the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.\nTo infer this limit, we first assume that the result of the merger is an\nultracompact object with an external geometry which is Schwarzschild or Kerr,\nbut with an outer surface which is capable of reflecting in-falling GWs rather\nthan fully absorbing them. If the absence of deviations from the predictions of\ngeneral relativity in detected GW signals will be verified, we will then obtain\na bound on the minimal redshift factor of GWs that emerge from the vicinity of\nthe object's surface. This lack of deviations would also mean that the remnant\nof the merger has to have a strongly absorbing surface and must then be a BH\nfor all practical purposes. We conclude that a relationship between the minimal\nredshift factor and the BH entropy, which was first proposed by 't Hooft, could\nthen be used to set a lower bound on the entropy of the post-merger BH.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Nov 2018 16:16:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 2019 21:16:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 2 Nov 2019 08:03:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-13"}

Stabilisation\nis done by tailor fitting individual proteins with a silica coat using a\nmodified sol-gel process. Biopharmaceuticals, for example, liquid-formulated\nvaccines with adjuvants, have poor thermal stability. Heating or freezing\nimpairs their potency. As a result, there is an increase in the prevalence of\nvaccine-preventable diseases in low-income countries even when there are means\nto combat them. One of the root causes lies in the problematic vaccine\ncold-chain distribution. We believe that ensilication can improve vaccine\navailability by enabling transportation without refrigeration. Here, we show\nthat ensilication stabilises tetanus toxoid C fragment (TTCF) and demonstrate\nthat this material can be stored and transported at ambient temperature without\ncompromising the immunogenic properties of TTCF in vivo. TTCF is a component of\nthe diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP) vaccine. To further our\nunderstanding of the ensilication process, and its protective effect on\nproteins we have studied the formation of TTCF-silica nanoparticles via\ntime-resolved Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS). Our results reveal\nensilication to be a staged diffusion-limited cluster aggregation (DLCA) type\nreaction, induced by the presence of TTCF protein at neutral pH. Analysis of\nscattering data indicates tailor fitting of TTCF protein. The experimental in\nvivo immunisation data confirms the retention of immunogenicity after release\nfrom silica. Our results suggest that we could utilise this technology for\nmulticomponent vaccines, therapeutics or other biopharmaceuticals that are not\ncompatible with lyophilisation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Nov 2018 16:29:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-09"}

Efficient face\ndetection algorithms can indeed help to detect and identify the persons present\nin the room, and also be used to automatically anonymize the data. However,\ncurrent algorithms trained on natural images do not generalize well to the\noperating room (OR) images. In this work, we provide a comparison of\nstate-of-the-art face detectors on OR data and also present an approach to\ntrain a face detector for the OR by exploiting non-annotated OR images.\nMethods: We propose a comparison of 6 state-of-the-art face detectors on\nclinical data using Multi-View Operating Room Faces (MVOR-Faces), a dataset of\noperating room images capturing real surgical activities. We then propose to\nuse self-supervision, a domain adaptation method, for the task of face\ndetection in the OR. The approach makes use of non-annotated images to\nfine-tune a state-of-the-art detector for the OR without using any human\nsupervision.

In HELEN-I device at IPR, helicon plasma is produced using Hydrogen gas\nin a diverging magnetic field, created by a permanent ring magnet. RF Power\n($P_{RF}$) of 800-1000W at 13.56 MHz frequency is applied to a Nagoya-III\nantenna to excite m = 1 helicon mode in the plasma. The plasma is confined by a\nmulti-cusp field configuration in the expansion chamber. The transition from\ninductively coupled mode to Helicon mode is observed near $P_{RF}$ 700W with\nplasma density $\\sim 10^{18} m^{-3}$ and electron temperature $\\sim$ 5 eV in\nthe driver and $\\sim$ 1eV in the expansion volume. Line integrated negative\nhydrogen ion density is measured in the expansion chamber by employing an\nOptical Emission Spectroscopy (OES) diagnostic technique using\n$H_\\alpha/H_\\beta$ ratio and Laser photo-detachment based Cavity Ring Down\nspectroscopic (CRDS) diagnostic technique. The measured value of negative\nhydrogen ion density is in the order of $10^{16} m^{-3}$ at 6 mTorr pressure\nand does not vary significantly with power in the helicon mode, pressure and\ndownstream axial magnetic field variation. The negative ion density\nmeasurements are compared with theoretically estimated values calculated using\nparticle balance method considering different reaction rates responsible for\nnegative hydrogen ion creation and destruction. It is to be noted that at\npresent Caesium (Cs) is not injected in the plasma discharge to enhance $H^-$\nion density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Nov 2018 17:11:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-22"}

Thus\nreceivers for the wideband communication systems often need to mitigate\ninterferers to reduce the distortion caused by the amplifier nonlinearity and\nnoise. Recently, a new architecture for communication receivers known as random\nmodulation mixes a signal with different pseudorandom sequences using multiple\nbranches of channels before sampling. While random modulation is used in these\nreceivers to acquire the signal at low sampling rates, the modulation sequences\nused lack the ability to suppress interferers due to their flat spectra. In\nprevious work, we introduced the design of a single spectrally shaped binary\nsequence that mitigates interferers to replace the pseudorandom sequence in a\nchannel. However, the designed sequences cannot provide the stable recovery\nachieved by pseudorandom sequence approaches. In this paper, we extend our\nprevious sequence design to guarantee stable recovery by designing a set of\nsequences to be orthogonal to each other. We show that it is difficult to find\nthe necessary number of sequences featuring mutual orthogonality and introduce\noversampling to the sequence set design to improve the recovery performance. We\npropose an algorithm for multi-branch sequence design as a binary optimization\nproblem, which is solved using a semidefinite program relaxation and randomized\nprojection.

The idea is to construct, as an effective\nweakly-coupled theory, a nonlinear realization of the conformal algebra in\nterms of physical, gauge-invariant, operators. The efficiency of the method is\nalso in the use of an analog of the light-cone gauge and of the momentum-space\non the CFT side. AdS/CFT is used as a convenient regulator and as a source of\nthe canonical bracket. The uniqueness of the nonlinear realization manifests\nthe three-dimensional bosonization duality at this order.

Yet, there is much that is unknown about the mechanism behind the\nentrainment of such bubbles. Furthermore, quantitative information regarding\ntheir size distribution and dependence on flow parameters is very limited.\nImpact events are hypothesized to be the main contributor to the generation of\nmicro-bubbles. This is due to a phenomenon known as Mesler entrainment, which\nhas been observed in the context of the drop-pool impact problem. Namely, when\na water droplet with diameter of $\\mathcal{O}(1mm)$ impacts a deep water pool\nwith an impact velocity of $\\mathcal{O}(1m/s)$, hundreds of air micro-bubbles\nare entrained into the pool.

The latter is an exact,\nyet non-closed equation, involving aver-ages over the time history of the\nnon-Markovian response. This nonlocality is treated by applying an extension of\nthe Novikov-Furutsu theorem and a novel approximation, employing a stochastic\nVolterra-Taylor functional expansion around instantaneous response moments,\nleading to efficient, closed, approximate equations for the response pdf. These\nequations retain a tractable amount of nonlocality and nonlinearity, and they\nare valid in both the transient and long-time regimes for any correlation\nfunction of the excitation. Also, they include as special cases various\nexisting relevant models, and generalize Hanggi's ansatz in a rational way.\nNumerical results for a bistable nonlinear RDE confirm the accuracy and the\nefficiency of the new equations.

By\nanalyzing the classical vacuum energy as a function of parameters such as the\nHiggs mass, we show how near-criticality, i.e. fine-tuning, corresponds\nuniversally to boundaries where the vacuum energy transitions from exactly flat\nto concave down. In the presence of quantum corrections, these boundary regions\ncan easily be perturbed to become maxima of the vacuum energy. After\nintroducing a dynamical scalar field $\\phi$ which scans the Higgs sector\nparameters, we propose several possible mechanisms by which this field could be\nlocalized to the maximum. One possibility is that the $\\phi$ potential has many\nvacua, with those near the maximum vacuum energy expanding faster during a long\nperiod of cosmic inflation and hence dominating the volume of the Universe.\nAlternately, we describe scenarios in which vacua near the maximum could be\nanthropically favored, due to selection of the late-time cosmological constant\nor dark matter density. Independent of these specific approaches, the physical\nvalue of the weak scale in our proposal is generated naturally and dynamically\nfrom loops of heavy states coupled to the Higgs.

Bell's theorem only shows that quantum\ncorrelations violate the conjunction of the ontological assumptions of localism\nand determinism. Taking a cue from computational complexity theory, here we\ndefine such a concept of locality in terms of a class of operational decision\nproblems, and propose that Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering in its basic\nasymmetric formulation gives a specific realization of this class. Various\nnonclassical (convex) operational theories, including quantum mechanics, are\nshown to be nonlocal according to this operational criterion. We discuss\nseveral ramifications arising from this result. It indicates a basic difference\nbetween quantum no-signaling and relativistic no-signaling, and suggests an\ninformation theoretic derivation of the former from other basic principles in\nthe convex framework. It elucidates the connection between two different bounds\non nonlocality, due to Oppenheim and Wehner (2010) and Banik et al.

Among its\nmany effects, EHR (1) changes the thermal balance of the CGM, increasing its\ncool gas content and decreasing its warm/hot gas content; (2) preserves cool\ngas structures for longer periods; and (3) enables these cool clouds to exist\nat progressively smaller size scales. Observationally, this results in a boost\nin \"low ions\" like H I and a drop in \"high ions\" like O VI throughout the CGM.\nThese effects of EHR do not converge in the Tempest simulations, but\nextrapolating these trends suggests that the CGM in reality is a mist\nconsisting of ubiquitous, small, long-lived, cool clouds suspended in a hot\nmedium at the virial temperature of the halo. Additionally, we explore the\nphysical mechanisms to explain why EHR produces the above effects, proposing\nthat it works both by (1) better sampling the distribution of CGM phases\nenabling runaway cooling in the denser, cooler tail of the phase distribution;\nand (2) preventing cool gas clouds from artificially mixing with the ambient\nhot halo and evaporating.

We further removed contamination by stars and artefacts,\nobtaining 606 galaxies lining up by the model selection box. We obtained their\nphotometric redshifts and physical properties by fitting model templates\nspanning a wide range of star formation histories, reddening and redshift. Key\nto constrain the models is the addition, to the optical DES bands $g$, $r$,\n$i$, $z$, and $Y$, of near-IR $J$, $H$, $K_{s}$ data from the Vista Hemisphere\nSurvey.

This is an\nideal sample for spectroscopic follow-up to select the fraction of galaxies\nwhich is truly at high redshift.

In\nthis approach, the main challenges include the design of a suitable variational\nansatz and optimization of its parameters. In this work, we address both of\nthese challenges. First, we define the variational class of Computational Graph\nStates (CGS) which gives a uniform framework for describing all computable\nvariational ansatz. Secondly, we develop a novel optimization scheme,\nsupervised wave-function optimization (SWO), which systematically improves the\noptimized wave-function by drawing on ideas from supervised learning. While SWO\ncan be used independently of CGS, utilizing them together provides a flexible\nframework for the rapid design, prototyping and optimization of variational\nwave-functions. We demonstrate CGS and SWO by optimizing for the ground state\nwave-function of 1D and 2D Heisenberg models on nine different variational\narchitectures including architectures not previously used to represent quantum\nmany-body wave-functions and find they are energetically competitive to other\napproaches. One interesting application of this architectural exploration is\nthat we show that fully convolution neural network wave-functions can be\noptimized for one system size and, using identical parameters, produce accurate\nenergies for a range of system sizes. We expect these methods to increase the\nrate of discovery of novel variational ansatz and bring further insights to the\nquantum many body problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Nov 2018 19:00:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-03"}

We confirm these analytic estimates using Cartesian Boussinesq\nconvection simulations. These mean horizontal flows lead to a random angular\nmomentum in supergiant convection zones that exceeds that of the last stable\ncircular orbit of a black hole by a factor of order 10. As a result, failed\nexplosions of supergiants - in which the accretion shock onto the neutron star\ndoes not revive, leading to black hole formation - may often produce accretion\ndiscs that can power day-week (blue supergiants) or week-year (yellow and red\nsupergiants) non-thermal and thermal transients through winds and jets.

However, the inclusion of baryons in\nthe simulations changes the picture because processes associated with the\npresence of a large galaxy in the halo can destroy subhalos and substantially\nalter the mass function and velocity distribution of subhalos. We compare the\neffect of galaxy formation on subhalo populations in two state-of-the-art sets\nof hydrodynamical CDM simulations of Milky Way mass halos, APOSTLE and AURIGA.\nWe introduce a new method for tracking the orbits of subhalos between\nsimulation snapshots that gives accurate results down to a few kiloparsecs from\nthe centre of the halo. Relative to a dark matter-only simulation, the\nabundance of subhalos in APOSTLE is reduced by 50% near the centre and by 10%\nwithin r200. In AURIGA the corresponding numbers are 80% and 40%. The velocity\ndistributions of subhalos are also affected by the presence of the galaxy, much\nmore so in AURIGA than in APOSTLE . The differences on subhalo properties in\nthe two simulations can be traced back to the mass of the central galaxies,\nwhich in AURIGA are typically twice as massive as those in APOSTLE . We show\nthat some of the results from previous studies are inaccurate due to systematic\nerrors in the modelling of subhalo orbits near the centre of halos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Nov 2018 19:14:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Jul 2019 19:01:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

We obtain these results by proving\nimproved bounds on the weight distribution of Reed-Muller codes of high\ndegrees. Specifically, given weight $\\beta \\in (0,1)$ we prove an upper bound\non the number of codewords of relative weight at most $\\beta$. We obtain new\nresults in two different settings: for weights $\\beta < 1/2$ and for weights\nthat are close to $1/2$.\n  Our new bounds on the weight distribution imply that RM codes with $m$\nvariables and degree $\\gamma m$, for some explicit constant $\\gamma$, achieve\ncapacity for random erasures (i.e. for the binary erasure channel) and for\nrandom errors (for the binary symmetric channel).

Thus, our result provide a new\nrange of parameters for which RM achieve capacity for these two well studied\nchannels.

Thus, for example, given noisy evaluations of a degree $0.499m$\npolynomial, it is possible to interpolate it even if a random $0.499$ fraction\nof the evaluations were corrupted, with high probability. While the $o(1)$\nterms are not the correct ones to ensure capacity, these results show that RM\ncodes of such degrees are in some sense close to achieving capacity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Nov 2018 19:36:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-03"}

It was previously\nshown that, in such settings, distributions exist for which the seller's\noptimal revenue is infinite, but the best \"simple\" mechanism achieves revenue\nat most one ([Briest et. al 15], [Hart and Nisan 13]), even when $m=2$.

We consider a buyer whose item values are drawn from an arbitrarily\ncorrelated multi-dimensional distribution then randomly perturbed with\nmagnitude $\\delta$ under several natural perturbation models. On one hand, we\nprove that the ([Briest et. al 15], [Hart and Nisan 13]) construction is\nsurprisingly robust to certain natural perturbations of this form, and the\ninfinite gap remains.\n  On the other hand, we provide a smoothed model such that the approximation\nguarantee of simple mechanisms is smoothed-finite. We show that when the\nperturbation has magnitude $\\delta$, pricing only the grand bundle guarantees\nan $O(1/\\delta)$-approximation to the optimal revenue. That is, no matter the\n(worst-case) initially correlated distribution, these tiny perturbations\nsuffice to bring the gap down from infinite to finite. We further show that the\nsame guarantees hold when $n$ buyers have values drawn from an arbitrarily\ncorrelated $mn$-dimensional distribution (without any dependence on $n$).\n  Taken together, these analyses further pin down key properties of correlated\ndistributions that result in large gaps between simplicity and optimality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Nov 2018 20:00:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-03"}

We study ultra-faint dwarf through Milky Way mass\nscales, including H+He photo-ionization; photo-electric, Lyman Werner, Compton,\nand dust heating; and single+multiple scattering radiation pressure (RP). We\ncompare distinct numerical algorithms: ray-based LEBRON (exact when\noptically-thin) and moments-based M1 (exact when optically-thick). The most\nimportant RFB channels on galaxy scales are photo-ionization heating and\nsingle-scattering RP: in all galaxies, most ionizing/far-UV luminosity (~1/2 of\nlifetime-integrated bolometric) is absorbed. In dwarfs, the most important\neffect is photo-ionization heating from the UV background suppressing\naccretion. In MW-mass galaxies, meta-galactic backgrounds have negligible\neffects; but local photo-ionization and single-scattering RP contribute to\nregulating the galactic star formation efficiency and lowering central\ndensities. Without some RFB (or other 'rapid' FB), resolved GMCs convert\ntoo-efficiently into stars, making galaxies dominated by hyper-dense, bound\nstar clusters. This makes star formation more violent and 'bursty' when SNe\nexplode in these hyper-clustered objects: thus, including RFB 'smoothes' SFHs.\nThese conclusions are robust to RHD methods, but M1 produces somewhat stronger\neffects. Like in previous FIRE simulations, IR multiple-scattering is rare\n(negligible in dwarfs, ~10% of RP in massive galaxies): absorption occurs\nprimarily in 'normal' GMCs with A_v~1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Nov 2018 20:03:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 8 Feb 2020 22:15:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-11"}

Besides, we found that the whole emission of the lobes is\nnon-thermal down to very low frequencies and that the possible associated\nemission mechanisms work differently in in both lobes, causing the\ndiscrepancies between observed frequencies.

Once a clog is formed in a microchannel, advected particles form\nan aggregate upstream from the site of the blockage. This aggregate grows over\ntime, which leads to a dramatic reduction of the flow rate. In this paper, we\npresent a model that predicts the growth of the aggregate formed upon clogging\nof a microchannel. We develop an analytical description that captures the time\nevolution of the volume of the aggregate, as confirmed by experiments performed\nusing a pressure-driven suspension flow in a microfluidic device. We show that\nthe growth of the aggregate increases the hydraulic resistance in the channel\nand leads to a drop in the flow rate of the suspensions.

The aggregate\ngrowths in the different channels are coupled. Our work illustrates the\ncritical influence of clogging events on the evolution of the flow rate in\nmicrochannels.

The normal force evolution with the gap size can be\nrelated to the layer formed inside the gap. The low hysteretic losses during\nthe linear cyclic motion suggest the presence of strong slip inside the gap.

Climatological studies have shown that the\n'tropical transition' (TT) pathway plays a prominent role in cyclogenesis, in\nparticular over the North Atlantic Ocean. Here we use operational European\nCentre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ensemble predictions to investigate\nthe TT of North Atlantic Hurricane Chris (2012), whose formation was preceded\nby the merger of two potential vorticity (PV) maxima, eventually resulting in\nthe storm-inducing PV streamer. The principal goal is to elucidate the dynamic\nand thermodynamic processes governing the predictability of cyclogenesis and\nsubsequent TT. Dynamic time warping is applied to identify ensemble tracks that\nare similar to the analysis track. This technique permits small temporal and\nspatial shifts in the development.\n  The formation of the pre-Chris cyclone is predicted by those members that\nalso predict the merging of the two PV maxima. The position of the storm\nrelative to the PV streamer determines whether the pre-Chris cyclone follows\nthe TT pathway. The transitioning storms are located inside a favorable region\nof high equivalent potential temperatures that result from a warm seclusion\nunderneath the cyclonic roll-up of the PV streamer. A systematic investigation\nof consecutive ensemble forecasts indicates that forecast improvements are\nlinked to specific events, such as the PV merging. The present case exemplifies\nhow a novel combination of Eulerian and Lagrangian ensemble forecast analysis\ntool allows to infer physical causes of abrupt changes in predictability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Nov 2018 22:13:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

The distribution across the width is more complicated but was later\nshown to be highly non-uniform, diverging at the edges. Accordingly, the\nstandard view for type II superconductors is that vortices enter at the edges\nand, with increasing current, are driven inwards until they self-annihilate at\nthe centre, causing dissipation. This condition is presumed to define the\ncritical current. However we have shown that, under self-field (no external\nfield), the transport critical current is a London surface current where the\nsurface current density equals the critical field divided by {\\lambda}, across\nthe entire width. The critical current distribution must therefore be uniform.\nHere we report studies of the current and field distribution across commercial\nYBa2Cu3O7 conductors and confirm the accepted non-uniform distribution at low\ncurrent but demonstrate a radical crossover to a uniform distribution at\ncritical current. This crossover ends discontinuously at a singularity and\ncalculations quantitatively confirm these results in detail.

With a prior more tightly constrained to\nresemble the theoretical EOS models, we recover $\\Lambda_{1.4} =\n556^{+163}_{-172}$ and $p(2\\rho_{\\mathrm{nuc}})=4.73^{+1.4}_{-2.5}\\times\n10^{34}~\\mathrm{dyn}/\\mathrm{cm}^2$. We further infer the maximum NS mass\nsupported by the EOS to be $M_\\mathrm{max}=2.09^{+0.37}_{-0.16}$\n($2.04^{+0.22}_{-0.002}$) $M_\\odot$ with the loose (tight) prior. The Bayes\nfactor between the two priors is $B^{\\mathcal{A}}_{\\mathcal{I}} \\simeq 1.12$,\nimplying that neither is strongly preferred by the data and suggesting that\nconstraints on the EOS from GW170817 alone may be relatively prior-dominated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Nov 2018 23:05:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2018 18:19:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-08"}

The lack of understanding of the underlying\nmechanism of ITH hinders progress in developing effective therapies for\ncancers. Based on the findings in a recent quantitative experiment on\npancreatic cancer, we developed a general evolutionary model for one type of\ncancer, accounting for interactions between different cell populations through\nparacrine or juxtacrine factors. We show that the emergence of a stable\nheterogeneous state in a tumor requires an unequal allocation of paracrine\ngrowth factors (\"public goods\") between cells that produce them and those that\nmerely consume them. Our model provides a quantitative explanation of recent\n{\\it in vitro} experimental studies in pancreatic cancer in which insulin\ngrowth factor (IGF-II) plays the role of public goods. The calculated phase\ndiagrams as a function of exogenous resources and fraction of growth factor\nproducing cells show ITH persists only in a narrow range of concentration of\nexogenous IGF-II. Remarkably, maintenance of ITH requires cooperation among\ntumor cell subpopulations in harsh conditions, specified by lack of exogenous\nIGF-II, whereas surplus exogenous IGF-II elicits competition. Our theory also\nquantitatively accounts for measured {\\it in vivo} tumor growth in glioblastoma\nmultiforme (GBM). The predictions for GBM tumor growth as a function of the\nfraction of tumor cells are amenable to experimental tests.

The optical interferometer VLTI/GRAVITY has\nallowed to spatially resolved the optical jets in SS 433 for the first time. We\npresent here the second such observation taken over three nights in July 2017.\nIn addition, we use the multi-wavelength XSHOOTER spectrograph at VLT to study\nthe optical bullets in SS 433 in detail. GRAVITY reveals elongated\nexponential-like spatial profiles for the optical jets, suggestive of a heating\nmechanism acting throughout a long portion of the jet and naturally explained\nby photoionization by the collimated radiation. We also spatially resolve the\nmovement of the optical bullets for the first time, detecting extended jet\ncomponents corresponding to previous ejections. \\texttt{Cloudy} photoionization\nmodels explain both the spatial intensity profiles measured with GRAVITY and\nthe line ratios from XSHOOTER, and constrain the properties of the optical\nbullets and the ionizing radiation. We find that the latter must peak in the UV\nwith an isotropic luminosity (as inferred by a face on observer) $\\approx\n10^{41}$ erg/s. Provided that the X-ray SED is sufficiently hard, the\ncollimated X-ray luminosity could still be high enough so that the face on\nobserver would see SS 433 as an ULX ($L_X \\lesssim 10^{40}$ erg/s) and it would\nstill be compatible with the H/He/He+ ionization balance of the optical\nbullets. The kinetic power in the optical jets is constrained to $3-20 \\times\n10^{38}$ erg/s, and the extinction in the optical jets to $A_V = 6.7 \\pm 0.1$.\nWe suggest there may be substantial $A_V \\gtrsim 1$ and structured\ncircumstellar extinction in SS 433, likely arising from dust formed in\nequatorial outflows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Nov 2018 01:05:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-24"}

There are many existing methods for solving the\nrational approximation problem, from fixed point methods like the\nSanathanan-Koerner iteration and Vector Fitting, to partial interpolation\nmethods like Adaptive Anderson Antoulas (AAA). While these methods can often\nfind rational approximations with a small residual norm, they are unable to\nfind optimizers with respect to a weighted l2 norm with a square dense\nweighting matrix. Here we develop a nonlinear least squares approach\nconstructing rational approximations with respect to this norm. We explore this\napproach using two parameterizations of rational functions: a ratio of two\npolynomials and a partial fraction expansion. In both cases, we show how we can\nuse Variable Projection (VARPRO) to reduce the dimension of the optimization\nproblem. As many applications seek a real rational approximation that can be\ndescribed as a ratio of two real polynomials, we show how this constraint can\nbe enforced in both parameterizations.

Our results\nshow that the proposed maximum-ratio transmission (MRT) based on the strongest\ncomponents can achieve a higher data rate than that of the conventional MRT,\nunder the same mean squared errors (MSE). Second, we develop a low-complexity\nchannel estimation and beamformer/precoder design scheme for hybrid mmWave\nsystems.

By proposing a\nrefined graphic rule, we prove that all the gauge invariance induced identities\nfor single trace tree-level EYM amplitudes can be precisely expanded in terms\nof traditional BCJ relations, without referring any property of polarizations.\nWhen further considering the transversality of polarizations and momentum\nconservation, we prove that the gauge invariance induced identity for\ntree-level GR (or pure YM) amplitudes can also be expanded in terms of\ntraditional BCJ relations for YM (or bi-scalar) amplitudes. As a byproduct, a\ngraph-based BCJ relation is proposed and proved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Nov 2018 07:42:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-22"}

However, the estimation of 3D geometries along with different\nlighting conditions using 3DMMs is still a difficult task. We herein represent\nthe face region with a latent variable that is assigned with the proposed deep\nneural network (DNN) instead of facial textures. The proposed DNN synthesizes a\nface-swapped image using the latent variable of the face region and another\nimage of the non-face region. The proposed method is not required to fit to the\n3DMM; additionally, it performs face swapping only by feeding two face images\nto the proposed network. Consequently, our DNN-based face swapping performs\nbetter than previous approaches for challenging inputs with different face\norientations and lighting conditions. Through several experiments, we\ndemonstrated that the proposed method performs face swapping in a more stable\nmanner than the state-of-the-art method, and that its results are compatible\nwith the method thereof.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Nov 2018 08:16:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-04"}

An efficient tackling of change request calls for an accurate\nlocalising of software changes, i.e. identifying which code are problematic and\nwhere new files should be added for any type of change request at hand, such as\na bug report or a feature request. Existing automatic techniques for this\nchange localisation problem are limited in two aspects: on the one hand, they\nare only limited to tackle a specific type of change request; on the other\nhand, they are focused on finding files that should be modified for a change\nrequest, yet barely capable of recommending what files or packages might be\nnewly created.

This is a more challenging task than the\nconventional semantic-level attribute transfer, which only preserves the\ngeneric attribute style instead of instance-level traits. We propose the use of\ngeometry-aware flow, which serves as a well-suited representation for modeling\nthe transformation between instance-level facial attributes. Specifically, we\nleverage the facial landmarks as the geometric guidance to learn the\ndifferentiable flows automatically, despite of the large pose gap existed.\nGeometry-aware flow is able to warp the source face attribute into the target\nface context and generate a warp-and-blend result. To compensate for the\npotential appearance gap between source and target faces, we propose a\nhallucination sub-network that produces an appearance residual to further\nrefine the warp-and-blend result. Finally, a cycle-consistency framework\nconsisting of both attribute transfer module and attribute removal module is\ndesigned, so that abundant unpaired face images can be used as training data.\nExtensive evaluations validate the capability of our approach in transferring\ninstance-level facial attributes faithfully across large pose and appearance\ngaps.

We introduce a simple and robust method to generate\nuncertainties from deterministic models, that does not require ensemble\nsimulations.

We argue that these two requirements are equally important, and we\nintroduce the Accuracy-Reliability cost function that quantitatively measures\nthe trade-off between accuracy and reliability. We then define the optimal\nuncertainties as the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution that\nminimizes the cost function.

We propose to\nestimate the variations in shape of the CCF by fitting a Skew Normal (SN)\ndensity which, unlike the commonly employed Normal density, includes a skewness\nparameter to capture the asymmetry of the CCF induced by stellar activity and\nthe convective blueshift. The performances of the proposed method are compared\nto the commonly employed Normal density using both simulations and real\nobservations, with different levels of activity and signal-to-noise ratio. When\nconsidering real observations, the correlation between the RV and the asymmetry\nof the CCF and between the RV and the width of the CCF are stronger when using\nthe parameters estimated with the SN density rather than the ones obtained with\nthe commonly employed Normal density. Using the proposed SN approach, the\nuncertainties estimated on the RV defined as the median of the SN are on\naverage 10% smaller than the uncertainties calculated on the mean of the\nNormal. The uncertainties estimated on the asymmetry parameter of the SN are on\naverage 15% smaller than the uncertainties measured on the Bisector Inverse\nSlope Span (BIS SPAN), which is the commonly used parameter to evaluate the\nasymmetry of the CCF. We also propose a new model to account for stellar\nactivity when fitting a planetary signal to RV data. Based on simple\nsimulations, we were able to demonstrate that this new model improves the\nplanetary detection limits by 12% compared to the model commonly used to\naccount for stellar activity. The SN density is a better model than the Normal\ndensity for characterizing the CCF since the correlations used to probe stellar\nactivity are stronger and the uncertainties of the RV estimate and the\nasymmetry of the CCF are both smaller.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Nov 2018 10:54:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-13"}

In this paper, the classic Gibbs\nalgorithm from Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods is demonstrated to be\ngeometrically ergodic for lattice Gaussian sampling, which means the Markov\nchain arising from it converges exponentially fast to the stationary\ndistribution. Meanwhile, the exponential convergence rate of Markov chain is\nalso derived through the spectral radius of forward operator. Then, a\ncomprehensive analysis regarding to the convergence rate is carried out and two\nsampling schemes are proposed to further enhance the convergence performance.\nThe first one, referred to as Metropolis-within-Gibbs (MWG) algorithm, improves\nthe convergence by refining the state space of the univariate sampling. On the\nother hand, the blocked strategy of Gibbs algorithm, which performs the\nsampling over multivariate at each Markov move, is also shown to yield a better\nconvergence rate than the traditional univariate sampling. In order to perform\nblocked sampling efficiently, Gibbs-Klein (GK) algorithm is proposed, which\nsamples block by block using Klein's algorithm. Furthermore, the validity of GK\nalgorithm is demonstrated by showing its ergodicity.

In many cases these fields exhibit organisation on a scale\nlarger than that of the underlying turbulent flow (e.g., the eleven-year solar\ncycle). The mechanism for the generation of so-called large scale fields\nremains an open problem. In cases where the magnetic Reynolds number ($Rm$) is\nsmall, dynamo-generated fields are coherent but at (the astrophysically\nrelevant) high $Rm$, the fields are overwhelmed by small scale fluctuating\nfield. Recently Tobias and Cattaneo (2013) have shown that an imposed large\nscale shear flow can suppress the small scale fluctuations and allow the large\nscale temporal behaviour to emerge. Shear is also believed to modify the\nelectromotive force by introducing correlations between the flow and the field.\nHowever in previous models at high $Rm$ the shear is often artificially imposed\nor driven by an arbitrary body force. Here we consider a simple kinematic model\nof a convective dynamo in which shear is self consistently driven by the\npresence of a horizontal temperature gradient (resulting in a thermal wind) and\na rotation vector that is oblique to gravity. By considering a\n$2.5$-dimensional system, we are able to reach high $Rm$ so that the dynamo\napproaches the asymptotic regime where the growth rate becomes approximately\nindependent of $Rm$. We find the flows studied here to be excellent small-scale\ndynamos, but with very little systematic behaviour evident at large $Rm$. We\nattribute this to being unable to self-consistently generate flows with both\nlarge (net) helicity and strong shear in this setup.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Nov 2018 11:27:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-03"}

Our goal was to\nempirically determine the sensitivity of these foraging indices to changes in\nthe temporal resolution of the observation. We used a high speed camera to\nrecord movement sequences of 20 Acanthodactylus boskianus lizards. We gradually\ndecreased the data resolution by ignoring short stops and either ignoring,\nelongating or leaving short moves unchanged. We then used the manipulated data\nto calculate the foraging indices at different temporal resolutions. We found\nthat movement-based indices are very sensitive to the observation resolution,\nso that realistic variation in the minimal duration of stops and moves could\nlead to 68 percent and 48 percent difference in MPM and PTM estimates,\nrespectively. When using the highest resolution, our estimate of MPM was an\norder of magnitude higher than all prior reported values for lizards. Also, the\ndistribution of stop durations was well described by a single heavy tailed\ndistribution above 0.35 seconds. This suggests that for A. boskianus there is\nno reason to ignore short stops above this threshold.

Recent research has suggested that generative adversarial network\n(GAN) has the capability of implicitly capturing data distribution. In this\npaper, we thus propose a simple but effective model for unsupervised domain\nadaption leveraging adversarial learning. The same encoder is shared between\nthe source and target domains which is expected to extract domain-invariant\nrepresentations with the help of an adversarial discriminator. With the labeled\nsource data, we introduce the center loss to increase the discriminative power\nof feature learned. We further align the conditional distribution of the two\ndomains to enforce the discrimination of the features in the target domain.\nUnlike previous studies where the source features are extracted with a fixed\npre-trained encoder, our method jointly learns feature representations of two\ndomains. Moreover, by sharing the encoder, the model does not need to know the\nsource of images during testing and hence is more widely applicable.

We find that in some cases the\ngravitational primordial spectrum can cross the sensitivity curves for DECIGO\ndetector with the maximum frequency sensitivity to the theoretical predictions\naround 0.05 - 0.30 Hz. From our results, it is clear that the future\ngenerations of space based interferometers can bring new perspectives to\nprobing modifications in general relativity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Nov 2018 12:37:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Apr 2019 14:36:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-16"}

To achieve this result we combine several\nrecent findings, including \\emph{string attractors} --- new combinatorial\nobjects encompassing most known compressibility measures for highly repetitive\ntexts ---, and grammars based on \\emph{locally-consistent parsing}.\n  More in detail, let $\\gamma$ be the size of the smallest attractor for a text\n$T$ of length $n$. The measure $\\gamma$ is an (asymptotic) lower bound to the\nsize of dictionary compressors based on Lempel--Ziv, context-free grammars, and\nmany others. The smallest known text representations in terms of attractors use\nspace $O(\\gamma\\log(n/\\gamma))$, and our lightest indexes work within the same\nasymptotic space. Let $\\epsilon>0$ be a suitably small constant fixed at\nconstruction time, $m$ be the pattern length, and $occ$ be the number of its\ntext occurrences. Our index counts pattern occurrences in\n$O(m+\\log^{2+\\epsilon}n)$ time, and locates them in $O(m+(occ+1)\\log^\\epsilon\nn)$ time.

The measurement of the\nelastic moduli, Young's modulus in the present case, versus temperature is an\neffective method for studying the influence of doping on a FE transition\nbecause the elastic properties are unaffected by electrical conductivity.

The TCBP is just like a mountain whose top is text\ncenter and foot is text border. The mountaintop can separate text instances\nwhich cannot be easily achieved using semantic segmentation map and its rising\ndirection can plan a road to top for each pixel on mountain foot at the group\nstage. The TCD helps TCBP learning better.

The periodicity of the outbursts is thought to correspond\nto the orbital period of the neutron star. To understand the behaviour shown by\nthis source, we performed the first multi-wavelength monitoring campaign during\nthe periastron passage of December 2017. The monitoring lasted for ~37 days and\nconsisted of X-ray, near-ultraviolet, and optical data from the Neil Gehrels\nSwift Observatory, the optical I band from the OGLE survey, and spectroscopic\nobservations of the H-alpha line performed with the 3.9 m Anglo-Australian\nTelescope. These observations revealed AX J0049.4-7323 during an anomalous\noutburst having remarkably different properties compared to the previous ones.\nIn the I band, it showed a longer rise timescale (~60 days instead of 1-5 days)\nand a longer decay timescale. At the peak of the outburst, it showed a sudden\nincrease in luminosity in the I band, corresponding to the onset of the X-ray\noutburst.

Our models unveil the critical role\nof vortices in determining the migration behaviour for partial gap-opening\nplanets. Vortices form in pressure maxima at gap edges, and prevent the\ndisc-feedback stopping of migration for intermediate planets in low-viscosity\nand inviscid discs, contrary to the concept of the `inertial limit' or `disc\nfeedback' halting predicted from analytical models. Vortices may also form in\nthe corotation region, and can dramatically modify migration behaviour through\ndirect gravitational interaction with the planet. These features become\napparent at high resolution, and for all but the highest viscosities there\nexist significant difficulties in obtaining numerically converged results. The\nmigration of partial gap-opening planets, however, clearly becomes chaotic for\nsufficiently low viscosities. At moderate viscosity, a smooth disc-feedback\nregime is found in which migration can slow substantially, and the migration\ntime-scale observed corresponds to migration being driven by diffusive\nrelaxation of the gap edges. At high viscosity classical Type I migration is\nrecovered. For Jupiter-analogue planets in inviscid discs, a wide, deep gap is\nformed. Transient Type II migration occurs over radial length-scales\ncorresponding to the gap width, beyond which migration can stall. Finally, we\nexamine the particle trapping driven by structures left in inviscid discs by a\nmigrating planet, and find that particle traps in the form of multiple rings\nand vortices can persist long after the planet has passed.

Further, although heterogeneous graphs\nhave been applied in different areas, a proper way to construct a heterogeneous\ngraph for interactive news data with an appropriate learning mechanism on it is\nstill desired. To address the above concerns, we propose a graph-based\nbehavior-aware network, which simultaneously considers six different types of\nbehaviors as well as user's demand on the news diversity.

It is accompanied\nby the DESC-WFD white paper (Lochner et al.). We argue for altering the nominal\ndeep drilling plan to have $>6$ month seasons, interweaving $gri$ and $zy$\nobservations every 3 days with 2, 4, 8, 25, 4 visits in $grizy$, respectively.\nThese recommendations are guided by metrics optimizing constraints on dark\nenergy and mitigation of systematic uncertainties, including specific\nrequirements on total number of visits after Y1 and Y10 for photometric\nredshifts (photo-$z$) and weak lensing systematics. We specify the precise\nlocations for the previously-chosen LSST deep fields (ELAIS-S1, XMM-LSS, CDF-S,\nand COSMOS) and recommend Akari Deep Field South as the planned fifth deep\nfield in order to synergize with Euclid and WFIRST.

One prevalent example of this is sampling posteriors in\nparametric distributions, such as latent-variable generative models. However\nsampling (even very approximately) can be #P-hard.\n  Classical results going back to Bakry and \\'Emery (1985) on sampling focus on\nlog-concave distributions, and show a natural Markov chain called Langevin\ndiffusion mixes in polynomial time. However, all log-concave distributions are\nuni-modal, while in practice it is very common for the distribution of interest\nto have multiple modes. In this case, Langevin diffusion suffers from torpid\nmixing.\n  We address this problem by combining Langevin diffusion with simulated\ntempering. The result is a Markov chain that mixes more rapidly by\ntransitioning between different temperatures of the distribution. We analyze\nthis Markov chain for a mixture of (strongly) log-concave distributions of the\nsame shape. In particular, our technique applies to the canonical multi-modal\ndistribution: a mixture of gaussians (of equal variance). Our algorithm\nefficiently samples from these distributions given only access to the gradient\nof the log-pdf.\n  For the analysis, we introduce novel techniques for proving spectral gaps\nbased on decomposing the action of the generator of the diffusion.

We consider the narrow escape problem in a cellular flow when the\ntwo gates randomly switch between different states with a switching rate k\nbetween the two gates. After briefly deriving the coupled partial differential\nequations for the escape time through two gates, we compute the mean escape\ntime for particles escaping from the gates with different initial states. By\nnumerical simulation under nonuniform boundary conditions, we quantify how\nnarrow escape time is affected by the switching rate k between the two gates,\narc length s between two gates, angular velocity w of the cellular flow and\ndiffusion coefficient D. We reveal that the mean escape time decreases with the\nswitching rate k between the two gates, angular velocity w and diffusion\ncoefficient D for fixed arc length, but takes the minimum when the two gates\nare evenly separated on the boundary for any given switching rate k between the\ntwo gates. In particular, we find that when the arc length size {\\epsilon} for\nthe gates is sufficiently small, the average narrow escape time is\napproximately independent of the gate arc length size. We further indicate\ncombinations of system parameters (regions located in the parameter space) such\nthat the mean escape time is the longest or shortest.

The slow components are discretized by a\nRunge-Kutta method, and the fast components are resolved by solving modified\nfast differential equations. Sandu (2018) developed the Multirate Infinitesimal\nGeneral-structure Additive Runge-Kutta (MRI-GARK) family of methods that\nincludes traditional MIS schemes as a subset. The MRI-GARK framework allowed\nthe construction of the first fourth order MIS schemes.

It\nwas shown by Sandu that the stability of decoupled implicit MRI-GARK methods\nhas limitations when both the fast and slow components are stiff and interact\nstrongly. This work extends the MRI-GARK framework by introducing coupled\nimplicit methods to solve stiff multiscale systems. The coupled approach has\nthe potential to considerably improve the overall stability of the scheme, at\nthe price of requiring implicit stage calculations over the entire system. Two\ncoupling strategies are considered. The first computes coupled Runge-Kutta\nstages before solving a single differential equation to refine the fast\nsolution. The second alternates between computing coupled Runge-Kutta stages\nand solving fast differential equations. We derive order conditions and perform\nthe stability analysis for both strategies.

These\ncavities store hundreds of kilowatts of coherent light and even higher optical\npower for future detectors. With such high optical power, the radiation\npressure effect inside the cavity creates sufficiently strong coupling between\ntest masses whose dynamics are significantly altered. The dynamics of two\nindependent nearly free masses become a coupled mechanical resonator system.\nThe transfer function of the local control system used for controlling the test\nmasses is modified by the radiation pressure effect. The changes in the\ntransfer function of the local control systems can result in a new type of\nangular instability which occurs at only 1.3 \\% of the Sidles-Sigg instability\nthreshold power. We report experimental results on a 74~m suspended cavity with\na few kilowatts of circulating power, for which the power to mass ratio is\ncomparable to the current Advanced LIGO. The radiation pressure effect on the\ntest masses behaves like an additional optical feedback with respect to the\nlocal angular control, potentially making the mirror control system unstable.\nWhen the local angular control system is optimized for maximum stability\nmargin, the instability threshold power increases from 4~kW to 29~kW. The\nsystem behavior is consistent with our simulation and the power dependent\nevolution of both the cavity soft and hard mode is observed.

While the forward model of simulating a TEM image from a given exit wave\nis known and easy to evaluate, it is in general not possible to reconstruct the\nexit wave from a series of images analytically.

In particular, they should reproduce past\nproduction data, which requires to solve a complex non-linear inverse problem.\nIn this paper, we thus propose to investigate the potential of machine learning\nalgorithms to predict the future production of a reservoir based on past\nproduction data without model calibration. We focus more specifically on robust\nonline aggregation, a deterministic approach that provides a robust framework\nto make forecasts on a regular basis. This method does not rely on any specific\nassumption or need for stochastic modeling. Forecasts are first simulated for a\nset of base reservoir models representing the prior uncertainty, and then\ncombined to predict production at the next time step. The weight associated to\neach forecast is related to its past performance. Three different algorithms\nare considered for weight computations: the exponentially weighted average\nalgorithm, ridge regression and the Lasso regression. They are applied on a\nsynthetic reservoir case study, the Brugge case, for sequential predictions.

This attack is known as the\nDeauthentication / Disassociation attack which is launched against 802.11-based\nwireless networks. When a client needs to disconnect from the wireless access\npoint, it sends special frames known as deauthentication or disassociation\nframes. Due to being encrypted, these frames do not require an authenticated\nuser. Hence, an attacker can craft these frames and send them to the access\npoint in such a way that the access point assumes the frames to be coming from\nthe client and not the attacker. In this paper, an efficient solution is\nproposed to prevent deauthentication attack by using a session management\nsystem used to then verify deauthentication frames.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Nov 2018 08:22:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

This paper focuses on the two-stage\nstochastic generalization of resource allocation problems where future demands\nare expressed in a finite number of possible scenarios. The goal is to select\ncost effective resources to be acquired in the present time (first stage), and\nto implement a complete solution for each scenario (second stage), while\nminimizing the total expected cost of the choices in both stages.\n  We propose an evolutionary framework for solving general two-stage stochastic\nresource allocation problems. In each iteration of our framework, a local\nsearch algorithm selects resources to be acquired in the first stage. A genetic\nmetaheuristic then completes the solutions for each scenario and relevant\ninformation is passed onto the next iteration, thereby supporting the\nacquisition of promising resources in the following first stage.\nExperimentation on numerous instances of the two-stage stochastic Steiner tree\nproblem suggests that our evolutionary framework is powerful enough to address\nlarge instances of a wide variety of two-stage stochastic resource allocation\nproblems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Nov 2018 17:30:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-06"}

This paper\naddresses the wetting difficulties encountered during inkjet printing on\nhomogeneous substrates as a result of improper surface properties. We show that\nthe wetting of a substrate and, consequently, the quality of the printed\npattern, can be mediated through the deposition of polymeric layers that are a\nfew nanometers thick. The chemical nature of the polymers determines the\nsurface energy and polarity of the thin layer. Some applications, however,\nrequire a rigorous adjustment of the surface properties. We propose a simple\nand precise method of surface-energy tailoring based on the thermal\ndecomposition of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) layers. A smooth transition\nin the wetting occurs when the thickness of the PMMA layer approaches zero,\nprobably due to percolating the underlying surface of the substrate, which\nenables the inkjet printing of complex structures with a high resolution. In\nparticular, the wetting of three substrate-ink systems was successfully\nadjusted using the thin polymeric layer: (i) a tantalum-oxide-based ink on\nindium-tin-oxide-coated glass, (ii) a ferroelectric lead zirconate titanate ink\non a platinized silicon substrate, and (iii) a silver nanoparticle ink on an\nalumina substrate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Nov 2018 09:24:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-26"}
