For a given level of\ntotal disturbance energy, the inflow spectra was designed to correspond to the\nnonlinearly most dangerous condition that leads to the earliest possible\ntransition Reynolds number. The synthesis of the inlet disturbance is\nformulated as a constrained optimization, where the control vector is comprised\nof the amplitudes and relative phases of the inlet modes; the constraints are\nthe prescribed total energy and that the flow evolution satisfies the full\nnonlinear compressible Navier-Stokes equations; the cost function is the\naverage wall friction which, once maximized, corresponds to the earliest\npossible transition location. An ensemble variational (EnVar) technique is\ndeveloped to solve the optimization problem. EnVar updates the estimate of the\ncontrol vector at the end of each iteration using the gradient of the cost\nfunction, which is computed from the outcome of an ensemble of possible\nsolutions. Two inflow conditions are computed, each corresponding to a\ndifferent level of energy, and their spectra are contrasted: the lower energy\ncase includes two normal acoustic waves and one oblique vorticity perturbation,\nwhereas the higher energy condition consists of oblique acoustic and vorticity\nwaves. The focus is placed on the former case, where the instability wave that\ninitiates the rapid breakdown to turbulence is not present at the inlet plane.\nInstead, it appears at a downstream location after a series of nonlinear\ninteractions that spur the fastest onset of turbulence. The results from the\nnonlinearly most potent inflow condition are also compared to other inlet\ndisturbances that are selected solely based on linear theory, and which all\nyield relatively delayed transition onset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Nov 2018 16:01:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-03"}

In this paper, we conduct a\nnumerical study of $b(\\theta)$ for free bosons on finite-size square lattices.\nWe find a surprisingly accurate fit between our lattice results and the\ncorresponding holographic function available in the literature. We also comment\non the ratio $b''(\\pi/2)/A_T$, where $A_T$ is the central charge in the near\nboundary expansion of the stress tensor, for which a holographic analysis\nsuggests that it may be a universal quantity. Though we show evidence that this\nratio is violated for the free boson with Dirichlet BCs, we conjecture its\nvalidity for free bosons evenly split between Dirichlet and Neumann BCs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Nov 2018 16:24:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 May 2019 14:57:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-07"}

In this manuscript, we studied ionic and\nfluidic movement through thin nanopores under viscosity gradients both\nexperimentally and using simulations.

The reversed\nelectroosmotic flow could be explained by slower depletion of coions than\ncounterions along the pore.

This limits such systems in two\ndifferent ways: If there is an update in the task domain, the dialogue system\nusually needs to be updated or completely re-trained. It is also harder to\nextend such dialogue systems to different and multiple domains. The dialogue\nstate tracker in conventional dialogue systems is one such component - it is\nusually designed to fit a well-defined application domain. For example, it is\ncommon for a state variable to be a categorical distribution over a\nmanually-predefined set of entities (Henderson et al., 2013), resulting in an\ninflexible and hard-to-extend dialogue system. In this paper, we propose a new\napproach for dialogue state tracking that can generalize well over multiple\ndomains without incorporating any domain-specific knowledge. Under this\nframework, discrete dialogue state variables are learned independently and the\ninformation of a predefined set of possible values for dialogue state variables\nis not required. Furthermore, it enables adding arbitrary dialogue context as\nfeatures and allows for multiple values to be associated with a single state\nvariable. These characteristics make it much easier to expand the dialogue\nstate space. We evaluate our framework using the widely used dialogue state\ntracking challenge data set (DSTC2) and show that our framework yields\ncompetitive results with other state-of-the-art results despite incorporating\nlittle domain knowledge. We also show that this framework can benefit from\nwidely available external resources such as pre-trained word embeddings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Nov 2018 17:01:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-03"}

Gyrotactic trapping has been proposed as a potential mechanism\nfor layer formation of bottom-heavy swimming algae cells, especially in flows\nwhere the vorticity varies linearly with depth (Durham, Stocker & Kessler,\nScience, vol. 323, 2009, pp. 1067-1070). Using a continuum model for dilute\nmicroswimmer suspensions, we report that an instability of a gyrotactically\ntrapped cell-layer can arise in a pressure-driven plane channel flow. The\nlinear stability analysis reveals that the equilibrium cell-layer solution is\nhydrodynamically unstable due to negative microswimmer buoyancy (i.e. a\ngravitational instability) over a range of biologically relevant parameter\nvalues. The critical cell concentration for this instability is found to be\n$N_c\\simeq 10^4\\textrm{cells}/\\textrm{cm}^{3}$, a value comparable to the\ntypical maximum cell concentration observed in thin layers. This result\nindicates that the instability may be a potential mechanism for limiting the\nlayer's maximum cell concentration, especially in regions where turbulence is\nweak, and motivates the study of its nonlinear evolution, perhaps, in the\npresence of turbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Nov 2018 17:12:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2019 21:04:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-22"}

The\nslider, which moves by definition towards the interface minima, is active as it\nalso stimulates growth of the interface. Even though such a particle has no\ncounterpart in thermodynamic systems, active sliders may provide a simple model\nfor ATP-dependent membrane proteins that activate cytoskeletal growth. We find\na wide range of dynamical regimes according to the ratio between the timescales\nassociated with the slider motion and the interface relaxation. If the\ninterface dynamics is slow, the slider behaves like a random walker in a random\nenvinronment which, furthermore, is able to escape environmental troughs by\nmaking them grow. This results in different dynamic exponens to the interface\nand the particle: the former behaves as an Edward-Wilkinson surface with\ndynamic exponent 2 whereas the latter has dynamic exponent 3/2. When the\ninterface is fast, we get sustained ballistic motion with the particle surfing\na membrane wave created by itself. However, if the interface relaxes\nimmediately (i.e., it is infinitely fast), particle motion becomes symmetric\nand goes back to diffusive. Due to such a rich phenomenology, we propose the\nactive slider as a toy model of fundamental interest in the field of active\nmembranes and, generally, whenever the system constituent can alter the\nenvironment by spending energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Nov 2018 17:25:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Apr 2019 09:17:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-25"}

We measured architecture debt in two ways: 1) in terms of\nsystem-wide coupling measures, and 2) in terms of the number and severity of\narchitectural flaws. In recent work it was shown that the amount of\narchitectural debt has a huge impact on software maintainability and evolution.\nConsequently, detecting and reducing the debt is expected to make software more\namenable to change. This paper reports on a longitudinal study of a healthcare\ncommunications product created by Brightsquid Secure Communications Corp. This\nstart-up company is facing the typical trade-off problem of desiring\nresponsiveness to change requests, but wanting to avoid the ever-increasing\neffort that the accumulation of quick-and-dirty changes eventually incurs. In\nthe first stage of the study, we analyzed the status of the \"before\" system,\nwhich indicated the impacts of change requests. This initial study motivated a\nmore in-depth analysis of architectural debt. The results of this analysis were\nused to motivate a comprehensive refactoring of the software system. The third\nphase of the study was a follow-on architectural debt analysis which quantified\nthe improvements made. Using this quantitative evidence, augmented by\nqualitative evidence gathered from in-depth interviews with Brightsquid's\narchitects, we present lessons learned about the costs and benefits of paying\ndown architecture debt in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Nov 2018 17:29:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-03"}

In combinatorial quantum\ngravity the entropy area law emerges naturally as a consequence of\ninfinite-dimensional critical behaviour on networks rather than on lattices.

In\nactions with incomplete precondition list, that applicable in several states\nand circumstances, ambiguity regarding the impact of the action is challenging\neven in small domains. To estimate the real impact of actions, an evaluation of\nthe effect list will not be enough; a relative estimation is more informative\nand suitable for estimation of action's real impact. Recent work on\nOver-subscription Planning (OSP) defined the net utility of action as the net\nchange in the state's value caused by the action. The notion of net utility of\naction allows for a broader perspective on value action impact and use for a\nmore accurate evaluation of achievements of the action, considering inter-state\nand intra-state dependencies. To achieve value-rational decisions in complex\nreality often requires strategic, high level, planning with a global\nperspective and values, while many local tactical decisions require real-time\ninformation to estimate the impact of actions. This paper proposes an offline\naction-value structure analysis to exploit the compactly represented\ninformativeness of net utility of actions to extend the scope of planning to\nvalue uncertainty scenarios and to provide a real-time value-rational decision\nplanning tool. The result of the offline pre-processing phase is a compact\ndecision planning model representation for flexible, local reasoning of net\nutility of actions with (offline) value ambiguity. The obtained flexibility is\nbeneficial for the online planning phase and real-time execution of actions\nwith value ambiguity. Our empirical evaluation shows the effectiveness of this\napproach in domains with value ambiguity in their action-value-structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Nov 2018 18:04:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-03"}

A second order effect in the fluid\nequations was recently found to make a significant contribution: an offset\nvelocity between gas and dark matter, the so-called streaming velocity.\nPrevious simulations of a limited number of low-mass dark matter haloes suggest\nthat this streaming velocity can delay the formation of the first stars and\ndecrease halo gas fractions and the halo mass function in the low mass regime.\nHowever, a systematic exploration of its effects in a large sample of haloes\nhas been lacking until now.

Our simulations have very\nhigh mass resolution, enabling us to accurately resolve minihaloes as small as\n$10^5 \\: {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$.

These methods often produce what\nappear to be good or very good designs when compared to classical design\nmethods, but it is not known how far from optimal such designs really are. We\naddress this issue by developing methods for computing a bound on the true\noptimal value of a physical design problem; physical designs with objective\nsmaller than our bound are impossible to achieve. Our bound is based on\nLagrange duality and exploits the special mathematical structure of these\nphysical design problems. For a multi-mode 2D Helmholtz resonator, numerical\nexamples show that the bounds we compute are often close to the objective\nvalues obtained using local optimization methods, which reveals that the\ndesigns are not only good, but in fact nearly optimal. Our computational\nbounding method also produces, as a by-product, a reasonable starting point for\nlocal optimization methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Nov 2018 18:47:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Jan 2019 19:46:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 1 Jun 2019 18:12:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-20"}

We focus\non the influence of the out-of-phase current in the regime where the ionic\ncharge is neutral. We consider the case where the charged spheres have no\nsurface conductance and no frequency-dependent surface capacitance. Hence, the\nfrequency dispersion of the dielectric constant is dominated by the effect of\nneutral currents outside the electric double layer. In the thin double-layer\nlimit, we use Fixman's boundary condition at the outer surface of the double\nlayer to capture interaction between the electric field and the flow of the\nions. For periodic conditions, we combine the methods developed by Lord\nRayleigh for understanding the electric conduction across rectangularly\narranged obstacles and by Korringa, Kohn and Rostoker for the electronic band\nstructure computation. When the charged spheres occupy a very small volume\nfraction, smaller than one percent, our solution becomes consistent with the\nMaxwell Garnett mixing formula together with the single-particle polarization\nresponse, as expected, because inter-particle interactions become less\nprominent in the dilute limit. By contrast, the inter-particle interaction\ngreatly alters the dielectric response even when charged spheres occupy only\ntwo percent of the volume. We found that the characteristic frequency shifts to\na higher value compared to that derived from the single-particle polarization\nresponse. At the same time, the low-frequency dielectric enhancement, a\nsignature of charged spheres immersed in an electrolyte, becomes less prominent\nfor the periodic array of charged spheres. Our results imply that the signature\nof the dielectric response of a system consisting of densely packed charged\nspheres immersed in an electrolyte can differ drastically from a dilute\nsuspension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Nov 2018 19:00:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

We investigate the role played by a pre-supernova (SN) ambient magnetic\nfield on the dynamics of the expanding remnant of SN 1987A and the origin and\nevolution of the radio emission from the remnant, in particular, during the\ninteraction of the blast wave with the nebula surrounding the SN. Methods. We\nmodel the evolution of SN 1987A from the breakout of the shock wave at the\nstellar surface to the expansion of its remnant through the surrounding nebula\nby 3D MHD simulations. The model considers the radiative cooling, the\ndeviations from equilibrium of ionization, the deviation from\ntemperature-equilibration between electrons and ions, and a plausible\nconfiguration of the pre-SN ambient magnetic field. From the simulations, we\nsynthesize both thermal X-ray and non-thermal radio emission and compare the\nmodel results with observations. Results. The presence of an ambient magnetic\nfield reduces the erosion and fragmentation of the dense equatorial ring after\nthe impact of the SN blast wave. As a result, the ring survives the passage of\nthe blast, at least, during the time covered by the simulations (40 years). Our\nmodel is able to reproduce the morphology and lightcurves of SN 1987A in both\nX-ray and radio bands. The model reproduces the observed radio emission if the\nflux originating from the reverse shock is heavily suppressed. In this case,\nthe radio emission originates mostly from the forward shock traveling through\nthe H II region. Possible mechanisms for the suppression of emission from the\nreverse shock are investigated. We find that synchrotron self-absorption and\nfree-free absorption have negligible effects on the emission during the\ninteraction with the nebula. We suggest that the emission from the reverse\nshock at radio frequencies might be limited by highly magnetized ejecta.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Nov 2018 19:02:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-30"}

The UN's sustainable development goal\n3.7.1 proposes satisfying the demand for family planning (FP) services by\nincreasing the proportion of women of reproductive age using modern methods. To\nmeasure progress toward such goals in populous countries like Nigeria, it's\nessential to characterize the current levels and trends of FP indicators such\nas unmet need and modern contraceptive prevalence rates (mCPR). Moreover, the\nsubstantial heterogeneity across Nigeria and scale of programmatic\nimplementation requires a sub-national resolution of these FP indicators.\nHowever, significant challenges face estimating FP indicators sub-nationally in\nNigeria. In this article, we develop a robust, data-driven model to utilize all\navailable surveys to estimate the levels and trends of FP indicators in\nNigerian states for all women and by age-parity demographic subgroups.

Our flexible modeling framework directly informs\nprogrammatic decision-making by identifying age-parity-state subgroups with\nlarge rates of unmet need, highlights conflicting trends across survey\ninstruments, and holistically interprets direct survey estimates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Nov 2018 19:06:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-04"}

We first show that the subunit on- and off-rates satisfy a rigorous\nthermodynamic relationship determined by the filament-obstacle interaction\npotential. Both the on- and off-rates depend not only on the average force on\nthe obstacle, but also on the shape of the potential on the nanometer length\nscale. Basing obstacle-induced reduction of the on-rate entirely on the force\noverestimates the stall force when there are fluctuations in the force exerted\non a filament tip. We then perform simulations and analytic calculations using\nthe thermodynamic relationship. We find, consistent with expectations from\ngeneral thermodynamic relations, that the \"Brownian-Ratchet\" model is an upper\nbound to the growth velocity and that for purely repulsive potentials the\ngrowth velocity is essentially that predicted by the Brownian-Ratchet model.\nFor shallow potential wells of depth ~ 5k_BT, which might correspond to\ntransient filament-membrane attachments, the zero-force velocity is a\nsubstantial fraction of the free-filament velocity. In this case, the growth\nvelocity can depend strongly on the obstacle diffusion coefficient even when\nthe dimensionless diffusion coefficient is large. The velocity also drops more\nrapidly than predicted by the Brownian-ratchet model, in some cases by as much\nas a factor of 50 at an opposing force of 1 pN. For deep potential wells, as\nmight result from strong filament-membrane links, both the on- and off-rates\nare reduced significantly, slowing polymerization.

Such ability usually involves\nthe use of microphone arrays to localize, track and separate sound sources\nonline. Multi-microphone signal processing techniques can improve robustness to\nnoise but the processing cost increases with the number of microphones used,\nlimiting response time and widespread use on different types of mobile robots.\nSince sound source localization methods are the most expensive in terms of\ncomputing resources as they involve scanning a large 3D space, minimizing the\namount of computations required would facilitate their implementation and use\non robots. The robot's shape also brings constraints on the microphone array\ngeometry and configurations. In addition, sound source localization methods\nusually return noisy features that need to be smoothed and filtered by tracking\nthe sound sources. This paper presents a novel sound source localization\nmethod, called SRP-PHAT-HSDA, that scans space with coarse and fine resolution\ngrids to reduce the number of memory lookups. A microphone directivity model is\nused to reduce the number of directions to scan and ignore non significant\npairs of microphones. A configuration method is also introduced to\nautomatically set parameters that are normally empirically tuned according to\nthe shape of the microphone array. For sound source tracking, this paper\npresents a modified 3D Kalman (M3K) method capable of simultaneously tracking\nin 3D the directions of sound sources.

The ultimate goal of AI is to realize machines with human mind and\nconsciousness, but existing achievements mainly simulate intelligent behavior\non computer platforms. These achievements all belong to weak AI rather than\nstrong AI. How to achieve strong AI is not known yet in the field of\nintelligence science. Currently, this field is calling for a new paradigm,\nespecially Theory of Cognitive Relativity (TCR). The TCR aims to summarize a\nsimple and elegant set of first principles about the nature of intelligence, at\nleast including the Principle of World's Relativity and the Principle of\nSymbol's Relativity. The Principle of World's Relativity states that the\nsubjective world an intelligent agent can observe is strongly constrained by\nthe way it perceives the objective world. The Principle of Symbol's Relativity\nstates that an intelligent agent can use any physical symbol system to express\nwhat it observes in its subjective world. The two principles are derived from\nscientific facts and life experience. Thought experiments show that they are\nimportant to understand high-level intelligence and necessary to establish a\nscientific theory of mind and consciousness. Rather than brain-like\nintelligence, the TCR indeed advocates a promising change in direction to\nrealize true AI, i.e. artificial general intelligence or artificial\nconsciousness, particularly different from humans' and animals'. Furthermore, a\nTCR creed has been presented and extended to reveal the secrets of\nconsciousness and to guide realization of conscious machines. In the sense that\ntrue AI could be diversely implemented in a brain-different way, the TCR would\nprobably drive an intelligence revolution in combination with some additional\nfirst principles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Dec 2018 04:01:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 16 Dec 2018 14:11:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 20 Dec 2018 06:59:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-21"}

This representation is crucial in\nintroducing a novel estimator for the number of connected components for\ngeneral graphs, under the knowledge of the spectral gap of the original graph.\nThe connection is made precise via the Schatten $k$-norms of the graph\nLaplacian and the spectral representation of the number of connected\ncomponents.

Especially when detecting\ndensely packed objects in aerial images, methods relying on horizontal\nproposals for common object detection often introduce mismatches between the\nRegion of Interests (RoIs) and objects. This leads to the common misalignment\nbetween the final object classification confidence and localization accuracy.\nAlthough rotated anchors have been used to tackle this problem, the design of\nthem always multiplies the number of anchors and dramatically increases the\ncomputational complexity. In this paper, we propose a RoI Transformer to\naddress these problems. More precisely, to improve the quality of region\nproposals, we first designed a Rotated RoI (RRoI) learner to transform a\nHorizontal Region of Interest (HRoI) into a Rotated Region of Interest (RRoI).\nBased on the RRoIs, we then proposed a Rotated Position Sensitive RoI Align\n(RPS-RoI-Align) module to extract rotation-invariant features from them for\nboosting subsequent classification and regression. Our RoI Transformer is with\nlight weight and can be easily embedded into detectors for oriented object\ndetection. A simple implementation of the RoI Transformer has achieved\nstate-of-the-art performances on two common and challenging aerial datasets,\ni.e., DOTA and HRSC2016, with a neglectable reduction to detection speed. Our\nRoI Transformer exceeds the deformable Position Sensitive RoI pooling when\noriented bounding-box annotations are available. Extensive experiments have\nalso validated the flexibility and effectiveness of our RoI Transformer. The\nresults demonstrate that it can be easily integrated with other detector\narchitectures and significantly improve the performances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Dec 2018 06:05:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-04"}

In CGP,\nthe linear elliptic equation is solved on a coarsened grid compared to the\nother equations, leading to savings in computations time and complexity. One of\nthe most important applications of CGP is when a pressure correction scheme is\nused to obtain a numerical solution to the Navier-Stokes equations. In that\ncase there is an elliptic pressure Poisson equation. Depending on the pressure\ncorrection scheme used, the CGP method and its performance in terms of\nacceleration rate and accuracy level vary. The CGP framework has been\nestablished for non-incremental pressure projection techniques. In this\narticle, we apply CGP methodology for the first time to incremental pressure\ncorrection schemes.

We suggest LSST undertake mini-surveys that will match the\nWFIRST cadence and simultaneously observe the supernova survey fields during\nthe 2-year WFIRST supernova survey, achieving a stacked depth similar to that\nof the WFIRST data. We also suggest additional observations of these same\nregions throughout the LSST survey to get deep images earlier, have long-term\nmonitoring in the fields, and produce deeper images overall.

The objective of this work is therefore to\naccurately recover missing CFD data a posteriori at any time instance, given\nthat the solution has been written to disk at only a relatively small number of\ntime instances. We consider in particular high-order discretizations (e.g.,\ndiscontinuous Galerkin), as such techniques are becoming increasingly popular\nfor the simulation of highly separated flows. To satisfy this objective, this\nwork proposes a methodology consisting of two stages: 1) dimensionality\nreduction and 2) dynamics learning. For dimensionality reduction, we propose a\nnovel hierarchical approach. First, the method reduces the number of degrees of\nfreedom within each element of the high-order discretization by applying\nautoencoders from deep learning. Second, the methodology applies principal\ncomponent analysis to compress the global vector of encodings. This leads to a\nlow-dimensional state, which associates with a nonlinear embedding of the\noriginal CFD data. For dynamics learning, we propose to apply regression\ntechniques (e.g., kernel methods) to learn the discrete-time velocity\ncharacterizing the time evolution of this low-dimensional state. A numerical\nexample on a large-scale CFD example characterized by nearly 13 million degrees\nof freedom illustrates the suitability of the proposed method in an industrial\nsetting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Dec 2018 02:17:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2018 03:43:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 28 May 2019 21:31:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

In brain electrical stimulation\nmethods, following the surgery and electrode implantation, electrodes send\nelectrical impulses to the specific targets in the brain. The use of this\nstimulation method is provided therapeutic benefits for treatment chronic pain,\nessential tremor, Parkinsons disease, major depression, and neurological\nmovement disorder syndrome (dystonia). One area in which advancements have been\nrecently made is in controlling the movement and navigation of animals in a\nspecific pathway. It is important to identify brain targets in order to\nstimulate appropriate brain regions for all the applications listed above. An\nanimal navigation system based on brain electrical stimulation is used to\ndevelop new behavioral models for the aim of creating a platform for\ninteracting with the animal nervous system in the spatial learning task. In the\ncontext of animal navigation the electrical stimulation has been used either as\ncreating virtual sensation for movement guidance or virtual reward for movement\nmotivation. In this paper, different approaches and techniques of brain\nelectrical stimulation for this application has been reviewed.\n  Keywords: Rat Robot, Brain Computer Interface, Electrical Stimulation, Cyborg\nIntelligence, Brain to Brain Interface\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Dec 2018 13:56:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-11"}

With local authority maintained monitoring stations being\ngeographically sparse and the resultant datasets also featuring missing labels,\ncomputational data-driven mechanisms are needed to address the data sparsity\nchallenge. In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based method to\naccurately predict the Air Quality Index (AQI), using environmental monitoring\ndata together with meteorological measurements. To do so, we develop an air\nquality estimation framework that implements a neural network that is enhanced\nwith a novel Non-linear Autoregressive neural network with exogenous input\n(NARX), especially designed for time series prediction. The framework is\napplied to a case study featuring different monitoring sites in London, with\ncomparisons against other standard machine-learning based predictive algorithms\nshowing the feasibility and robust performance of the proposed method for\ndifferent kinds of areas within an urban region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Dec 2018 13:40:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-21"}

We utilize\nthe quantum Caldeira-Leggett master equation as a possible phenomenological\nmodel for the stock-market-prices fluctuations while introducing the external\nharmonic field for the Brownian particle. Two quantum regimes are of particular\ninterest: the exact regime as well as the approximate regime of the pure\ndecoherence (\"recoilless\") limit of the Caldeira-Leggett equation. By\ncalculating the standard deviation and the kurtosis for the particle's position\nobservable, we can detect deviations of the quantum-mechanical behavior from\nthe classical counterpart, which bases the efficient market hypothesis. By\nvarying the damping factor, temperature as well as the oscillator's frequency,\nwe are able to provide interpretation of different economic scenarios and\npossible situations that are not normally recognized by the efficient market\nhypothesis. Hence we recognize the quantum Brownian oscillator as a possibly\nuseful model for the realistic behavior of stock prices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Dec 2018 11:17:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-31"}
