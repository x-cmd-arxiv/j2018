However,\ngiven the challenge that it is not always possible to obtain out of\ndistribution samples, the authors suggest a GAN based alternative that is\nindependent of specific knowledge of out of distribution samples. From this\nexisting work, we also know that having access to the true out of sample\ndistribution for regularization works significantly better than using samples\nfrom the GAN. In this paper, we make the following observation: in practice,\nthe out of distribution samples are contained in the traffic that hits a\ndeployed classifier. However, the traffic will also contain a unknown\nproportion of in-distribution samples. If the entropy over of all of the\ntraffic data were to be naively maximized, this will hurt the classifier\nperformance on in-distribution data. To effectively leverage this traffic data,\nwe propose an adaptive regularization technique (based on the maximum\npredictive probability score of a sample) which penalizes out of distribution\nsamples more heavily than in distribution samples in the incoming traffic. This\nensures that the overall performance of the classifier does not degrade on\nin-distribution data, while detection of out-of-distribution samples is\nsignificantly improved by leveraging the unlabeled traffic data.

We showcase the\neffectiveness of our approach relative to state-of-the-art on hand-written\ncharacters as well as on a variety of natural image datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Dec 2018 18:51:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-04"}

The existing approaches proposed for detecting insider threats still\nhave a common shortcoming, which is the high number of false alarms (false\npositives). The challenge in these approaches is that it is essential to detect\nall anomalous behaviours which belong to a particular threat. To address this\nshortcoming, we propose an opportunistic knowledge discovery system, namely\nAnyThreat, with the aim to detect any anomalous behaviour in all malicious\ninsider threats. We design the AnyThreat system with four components. (1) A\nfeature engineering component, which constructs community data sets from the\nactivity logs of a group of users having the same role. (2) An oversampling\ncomponent, where we propose a novel oversampling technique named Artificial\nMinority Oversampling and Trapper REmoval (AMOTRE). AMOTRE first removes the\nminority (anomalous) instances that have a high resemblance with normal\n(majority) instances to reduce the number of false alarms, then it\nsynthetically oversamples the minority class by shielding the border of the\nmajority class. (3) A class decomposition component, which is introduced to\ncluster the instances of the majority class into subclasses to weaken the\neffect of the majority class without information loss.

Specifically, for testing\nhypotheses with a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure, by using the general\napproach, under the assumption of independence, we first develop a specific\nPFER controlling procedure and based on this procedure, then develop a new FDR\ncontrolling procedure, which can preserve the desired DAG structure among the\nrejected hypotheses. Through a small simulation study and a real data analysis,\nwe illustrate nice performance of the proposed FDR controlling procedure for\nDAG-structured hypotheses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Dec 2018 20:23:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-04"}

The methods of leak rate calculation using conventional manometer\nare valid only when both the volume of the test subject and ambient pressure\nare kept constant. But both these quantities for a RPC gas gap depend widely on\nthe ambient pressure and temperature. A proper quantitative estimation of the\nleak rate cannot be acquired from such pressure measurements. By monitoring the\nabsolute pressures, both outside and inside of an RPC, along with the\ntemperature, its leakage rate can be estimated. During the test period, the\nsupporting button spacers inside an RPC may get detached due to manufacturing\ndefect. This effect also needs to be detected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Dec 2018 22:52:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2019 09:15:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 17 Apr 2019 20:08:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-19"}

Encoding models make comprehensive predictions about\nrepresentational spaces. In the context of sensory systems, encoding models\nenable us to test and compare brain-computational models, and thus directly\nconstrain computational theory. Encoding and decoding models typically include\nfitted linear-model components. Sometimes the weights of the fitted linear\ncombinations are interpreted as reflecting, in an encoding model, the\ncontribution of different sensory features to the representation or, in a\ndecoding model, the contribution of different measured brain responses to a\ndecoded feature. Such interpretations can be problematic when the predictor\nvariables or their noise components are correlated and when priors (or\npenalties) are used to regularize the fit. Encoding and decoding models are\nevaluated in terms of their generalization performance. The correct\ninterpretation depends on the level of generalization a model achieves (e.g. to\nnew response measurements for the same stimuli, to new stimuli from the same\npopulation, or to stimuli from a different population).

We predict that a coupling between the\nspin-momentum locking (SML) observed in spin-orbit materials and low-energy\nbarrier magnets (LBM) should exhibit a unique multi-terminal rectification for\narbitrarily small amplitude channel currents. The basic idea is to measure the\ncharge current induced spin accumulation in the SML channel in the form of a\nmagnetization dependent voltage using an LBM, either with an in-plane or\nperpendicular anisotropy (IMA or PMA). The LBM feels an instantaneous\nspin-orbit torque due to the accumulated spins in the channel which causes the\naverage magnetization to follow the current, leading to the non-linear\nrectification. We discuss the frequency band of this multi-terminal\nrectification which can be understood in terms of the angular momentum\nconservation in the LBM. For a fixed spin-current from the SML channel, the\nfrequency band is same for LBMs with IMA and PMA, as long as they have the same\ntotal magnetic moment in a given volume.

They have gained\npopularity in better application management and deployment in recent years and\nare being widely used by organizations to deploy their increasingly diverse\nworkloads such as web services, big data, and IoT in either proprietary\nclusters or cloud data centres.

Comput. Phys., 373(2018)], the\nquadratic Wasserstein metric is successfully applied to the earthquake location\nproblem. The actual earthquake hypocenter can be accurately recovered starting\nfrom initial values very far from the true ones. However, the seismic wave\nsignals need to be normalized since the quadratic Wasserstein metric requires\nmass conservation. This brings a critical difficulty. Since the amplitude of a\nseismogram at a receiver is a good representation of the distance between the\nsource and the receiver, simply normalizing the signals will cause the\nobjective function in optimization process to be insensitive to the distance\nbetween the source and the receiver. When the data is contaminated with strong\nnoise, the minimum point of the objective function will deviate and lead to a\nlow accurate location result.\n  To overcome the difficulty mentioned above, we apply the\nWasserstein-Fisher-Rao (WFR) metric [Chizat et al., Found. Comput. Math.,\n18(2018)] to the earthquake location problem. The WFR metric is one of the\nnewly developed metric in the unbalanced Optimal Transport theory. It does not\nrequire the normalization of the seismic signals. Thus, the amplitude of\nseismograms can be considered as a new constraint, which can substantially\nimprove the sensitivity of the objective function to the distance between the\nsource and the receiver. As a result, we can expect more accurate location\nresults from the WFR metric based method compare to those based on quadratic\nWasserstein metric under high-intensity noise.

ECO possesses\nthree main properties: (1) reconfigurability: complex semantics and geometry is\ncaptured via the synthesis of atomic visual representations (e.g., image\npatch); (2) robustness: the visual semantics are registered in a geometrically\nconsistent way (e.g., aligning with respect to the gravity vector,\nfrontalizing, and rescaling to canonical depth), thus enabling us to learn\nmeaningful atomic representations; (3) adaptability: a domain adaptation\nframework is designed to generalize the learned representation without manual\ncalibration. As a proof-of-concept, we use ECO to localize a camera within\nreal-world scenes---various grocery stores---and demonstrate performance\nimprovements when compared to existing semantic localization approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Dec 2018 03:12:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-04"}

These problems lay great obstacles in the analysis,\nsimulation and design of memristor. To address these problems, a modeling\nmethodology for analytic approximate solution of the state variable in\nmemristor is proposed in this work.

We consider spatial contexts, for which we solve\nso-called jigsaw puzzles, i.e., each image is cut into grids and then\ndisordered, and the goal is to recover the correct configuration. Existing\napproaches formulated it as a classification task by defining a fixed mapping\nfrom a small subset of configurations to a class set, but these approaches\nignore the underlying relationship between different configurations and also\nlimit their application to more complex scenarios. This paper presents a novel\napproach which applies to jigsaw puzzles with an arbitrary grid size and\ndimensionality. We provide a fundamental and generalized principle, that weaker\ncues are easier to be learned in an unsupervised manner and also transfer\nbetter. In the context of puzzle recognition, we use an iterative manner which,\ninstead of solving the puzzle all at once, adjusts the order of the patches in\neach step until convergence. In each step, we combine both unary and binary\nfeatures on each patch into a cost function judging the correctness of the\ncurrent configuration. Our approach, by taking similarity between puzzles into\nconsideration, enjoys a more reasonable way of learning visual knowledge. We\nverify the effectiveness of our approach in two aspects.

Subsequently, a machine-learning (ML)\nframework is proposed to improve the precision of measuring DOA. In the\ntraining stage, the HAD transceiver works as a receiver and repeatedly measures\nthe values of DOA via I-HAD-ESPRIT to form a slightly large training data set\n(TDS) of DOA. From TDS, we find that the probability density function (PDF) of\nDOA measurement error (DOAME) is approximated as a Gaussian distribution by the\nhistogram method in ML.

The\ndiffusion has a random drift, and hence depending on the realisations of\nservice rates, the system can be in Quality Driven (QD), Efficiency Driven (ED)\nor Quality-Efficiency-Driven (QED) regime. When the system is under QD or QED\nregime, the abandonments are negligible in the fluid limit, but when it is\nunder ED regime, the probability of abandonment will converge to a non-zero\nvalue. We then analyse the optimal staffing levels to balance holding costs\nwith staffing costs combining these three regimes.

Absence of\nsecondary iron- and/or alkali-rich phases and occurrence of LIME olivine\nindicate that primitive chemical and isotopic compositions are preserved in the\nCAI. Davisite occur only in one lithological unit that consists of three\nchemically and isotopically distinct parts: i) $^{16}$O-poor regions with\nreversely-zoned melilite and davisite; ii) $^{16}$O-rich regions consisting of\nunzoned, gehlenitic melilite, diopside and spinel; and iii) spinel framboids\ncomposed of $^{16}$O-rich spinel and $^{16}$O-poor melilite.

For Bayesian inference, the iterative ensemble\nsmoother (IES) and implicit sampling are integrated to obtain importance\nensemble samples, which build an importance density. The proposed method shares\na similar idea to importance sampling. IES is used to approximate mean and\ncovariance of a posterior distribution. This provides the MAP point and the\ninverse of Hessian matrix, which are necessary to construct the implicit map in\nimplicit sampling. The importance samples are generated by the implicit map and\nthe corresponding weights are the ratio between the importance density and\nposterior density. In the proposed method, we use the ensemble samples of IES\nto find the optimization solution of likelihood function and the inverse of\nHessian matrix. This approach avoids the explicit computation for Jacobian\nmatrix and Hessian matrix, which are very computationally expensive in high\ndimension spaces. To treat non-Gaussian models, discrete cosine transform and\nGaussian mixture model are used to characterize the non-Gaussian priors.

It is believed that these\nfeatures are better at encoding the perceptual quality and provide more\nefficient representations of input images compared to other perceptual metrics\nsuch as SSIM and PSNR. However, there have been no systematic studies to\ndetermine the underlying reason. Due to the lack of such an analysis, it is not\npossible to evaluate the performance of a particular set of features or to\nimprove the perceptual quality even more by carefully selecting a subset of\nfeatures from a pre-trained CNN. This work shows that the capabilities of\npre-trained deep CNN features in optimizing the perceptual quality are\ncorrelated with their success in capturing basic human visual perception\ncharacteristics.

Although the\ntwo-step process seems to be natural and has been widely applied, it assumes\nthat the accelerators' behavior can be fully modeled on CPUs and GPUs. This\ndoes not hold true and the behavior of the CNN accelerators is un-deterministic\nwhen the circuit works at 'unstable' mode when it is overclocked or is affected\nby the environment like fault-prone aerospace. The exact behaviors of the\naccelerators are determined by both the chip fabrication and the working\nenvironment or status. In this case, applying the conventional off-line\ntraining result to the accelerators directly may lead to considerable accuracy\nloss.\n  To address this problem, we propose to train for the 'unstable' CNN\naccelerator and have the 'un-determined behavior' learned together with the\ndata in the same framework. Basically, it starts from the off-line trained\nmodel and then integrates the uncertain circuit behaviors into the CNN models\nthrough additional accelerator-specific training. The fine-tuned training makes\nthe CNN models less sensitive to the circuit uncertainty. We apply the design\nmethod to both an overclocked CNN accelerator and a faulty accelerator.\nAccording to our experiments on a subset of ImageNet, the accelerator-specific\ntraining can improve the top 5 accuracy up to 3.4% and 2.4% on average when the\nCNN accelerator is at extreme overclocking. When the accelerator is exposed to\na faulty environment, the top 5 accuracy improves up to 6.8% and 4.28% on\naverage under the most severe fault injection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Dec 2018 11:45:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-06"}

Analysis of these recordings often\ninvolve a dimensionality reduction step in which electrodes are grouped into 10\nor more regions (depending on the number of electrodes available). Then an\naverage over each group is taken which serves as a feature in subsequent\nevaluation. Currently, the most prominent features used in clinical practice\nare based on spectral power densities.
