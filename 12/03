Unlike feature extraction,\nsuch as PCA and autoencoder based methods, feature selection preserves\ninterpretability, meaning that the selected features provide direct information\nabout certain health conditions (i.e., the label). Thus, feature selection\nallows domain experts, such as clinicians, to understand the predictions made\nby machine learning based systems, as well as improve their own diagnostic\nskills. Mutual information is often used as a basis for feature selection since\nit measures dependencies between features and labels. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel mutual information based feature selection (MIBFS) method\ncalled SURI, which boosts features with high unique relevant information. We\ncompare SURI to existing MIBFS methods using 3 different classifiers on 6\npublicly available healthcare data sets. The results indicate that, in addition\nto preserving interpretability, SURI selects more relevant feature subsets\nwhich lead to higher classification performance. More importantly, we explore\nthe dynamics of mutual information on a public low-dimensional health data set\nvia exhaustive search. The results suggest the important role of unique\nrelevant information in feature selection and verify the principles behind\nSURI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Dec 2018 16:13:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-04"}

In this way, parallel theoretical and experimental\nstudies of few-body models become possible, which may provide a deeper\nunderstanding of correlation effects and give hints for designing and\ncontrolling new experiments. Of particular interest is to explore the physics\nin the strongly correlated regime and in the neighborhood of critical points.\n  Particle correlations in nanostructures may be characterized by their\nentanglement spectrum, i.e. the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix of\nthe system partitioned into two subsystems. We will discuss how to determine\nthe entropy of entanglement spectrum of few-body systems in bound and resonant\nstates within the same formalism. The linear entropy will be calculated for a\nmodel of quasi-one dimensional Gaussian quantum dot in the lowest energy\nstates. We will study how the entanglement depends on the parameters of the\nsystem, paying particular attention to the behavior on the border between the\nregimes of bound and resonant states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Dec 2018 17:31:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-22"}

Computer\nscientists consider the problem of inferring user representations more\nabstractly; how does one extract a stable user representation - effective for\nmany downstream tasks - from a medium as noisy and complicated as social media?\n  The quality of a user representation is ultimately task-dependent (e.g. does\nit improve classifier performance, make more accurate recommendations in a\nrecommendation system) but there are proxies that are less sensitive to the\nspecific task. Is the representation predictive of latent properties such as a\nperson's demographic features, socioeconomic class, or mental health state? Is\nit predictive of the user's future behavior?\n  In this thesis, we begin by showing how user representations can be learned\nfrom multiple types of user behavior on social media. We apply several\nextensions of generalized canonical correlation analysis to learn these\nrepresentations and evaluate them at three tasks: predicting future hashtag\nmentions, friending behavior, and demographic features. We then show how user\nfeatures can be employed as distant supervision to improve topic model fit.\nFinally, we show how user features can be integrated into and improve existing\nclassifiers in the multitask learning framework. We treat user representations\n- ground truth gender and mental health features - as auxiliary tasks to\nimprove mental health state prediction. We also use distributed user\nrepresentations learned in the first chapter to improve tweet-level stance\nclassifiers, showing that distant user information can inform classification\ntasks at the granularity of a single message.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Dec 2018 17:57:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-04"}

The increasing use of primitive models\nsignificantly simplifies and expedites the development cycles of ML systems.\nYet, because most of such models are contributed and maintained by untrusted\nsources, their lack of standardization or regulation entails profound security\nimplications, about which little is known thus far.\n  In this paper, we demonstrate that malicious primitive models pose immense\nthreats to the security of ML systems. We present a broad class of {\\em\nmodel-reuse} attacks wherein maliciously crafted models trigger host ML systems\nto misbehave on targeted inputs in a highly predictable manner. By empirically\nstudying four deep learning systems (including both individual and ensemble\nsystems) used in skin cancer screening, speech recognition, face verification,\nand autonomous steering, we show that such attacks are (i) effective - the host\nsystems misbehave on the targeted inputs as desired by the adversary with high\nprobability, (ii) evasive - the malicious models function indistinguishably\nfrom their benign counterparts on non-targeted inputs, (iii) elastic - the\nmalicious models remain effective regardless of various system design choices\nand tuning strategies, and (iv) easy - the adversary needs little prior\nknowledge about the data used for system tuning or inference. We provide\nanalytical justification for the effectiveness of model-reuse attacks, which\npoints to the unprecedented complexity of today's primitive models.

A generalized method of moments approach can be used to estimate model\nparameters in the absence of knowledge of the error distributions, but requires\nthe existence of a large number of model moments. In this paper, parameter\nestimation based on the phase function, a normalized version of the\ncharacteristic function, is considered. This approach requires the model\ncovariates to have asymmetric distributions, while the error distributions are\nsymmetric. Parameter estimation is then based on minimizing a distance function\nbetween the empirical phase functions of the noisy covariates and the outcome\nvariable. No knowledge of the measurement error distribution is required to\ncalculate this estimator. Both the asymptotic and finite sample properties of\nthe estimator are considered. The connection between the phase function\napproach and method of moments is also discussed. The estimation of standard\nerrors is also considered and a modified bootstrap algorithm is proposed for\nfast computation.

The\npredominant topic in this research domain is runtime analysis, which studies\nthe time it takes a given EA to solve a given optimization problem. Runtime\nanalysis has witnessed significant advances in the last couple of years,\nallowing us to compute precise runtime estimates for several EAs and several\nproblems. Runtime analysis is, however (and unfortunately!), often judged by\npractitioners to be of little relevance for real applications of EAs. Several\nreasons for this claim exist. We address two of them in this present work:\n  (1) EA implementations often differ from their vanilla pseudocode\ndescription, which, in turn, typically form the basis for runtime analysis. To\nclose the resulting gap between empirically observed and theoretically derived\nperformance estimates, we therefore suggest to take this discrepancy into\naccount in the mathematical analysis and to adjust, for example, the cost\nassigned to the evaluation of search points that equal one of their direct\nparents (provided that this is easy to verify as is the case in almost all\nstandard EAs).\n  (2) Most runtime analysis results make statements about the expected time to\nreach an optimal solution (and possibly the distribution of this optimization\ntime) only, thus explicitly or implicitly neglecting the importance of\nunderstanding how the function values evolve over time. We suggest to extend\nruntime statements to runtime profiles, covering the expected time needed to\nreach points of intermediate fitness values.\n  As a direct consequence, we obtain a result showing that the greedy (2+1) GA\nof Sudholt [GECCO 2012] outperforms any unary unbiased black-box algorithm on\nOneMax.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Dec 2018 00:13:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-04"}

Existing approaches\neither applied multi-view planar (2D) networks or directly used volumetric (3D)\nnetworks for this purpose, but both of them are not ideal: 2D networks cannot\ncapture 3D contexts effectively, and 3D networks are both memory-consuming and\nless stable arguably due to the lack of pre-trained models.\n  In this paper, we bridge the gap between 2D and 3D using a novel approach\nnamed Elastic Boundary Projection (EBP). The key observation is that, although\nthe object is a 3D volume, what we really need in segmentation is to find its\nboundary which is a 2D surface. Therefore, we place a number of pivot points in\nthe 3D space, and for each pivot, we determine its distance to the object\nboundary along a dense set of directions. This creates an elastic shell around\neach pivot which is initialized as a perfect sphere. We train a 2D deep network\nto determine whether each ending point falls within the object, and gradually\nadjust the shell so that it gradually converges to the actual shape of the\nboundary and thus achieves the goal of segmentation.

In this work we\nshow an interesting observation that, adding a helper can totally remove the\npenalty in sum GDoF, for a two-user symmetric Gaussian interference channel.\nFor the interference channel where each transmitter sends a message to an\nintended receiver without secrecy constraints, the sum GDoF is a well-known \"W\"\ncurve, characterized by Etkin-Tse-Wang in 2008. If the secrecy constraints are\nimposed on this interference channel, where the message of each transmitter\nmust be secure from the unintended receiver (eavesdropper), then a GDoF penalty\nis incurred and the secure sum GDoF is reduced to a modified \"W\" curve, derived\nby Chen recently.

The proposed scheme is based on the cooperative jamming\nand a careful signal design such that the jamming signal of the helper is\naligned at a specific direction and power level with the information signals of\nthe transmitters, which allows to totally remove the penalty in GDoF due to the\nsecrecy constraints.

The recent implementation of deep\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) in image processing has been shown to have\nsignificant impacts on medical image segmentation. Network training of\nsegmentation CNNs typically requires images and paired annotation data\nrepresenting pixel-wise tissue labels referred to as masks. However, the\nsupervised training of highly efficient CNNs with deeper structure and more\nnetwork parameters requires a large number of training images and paired tissue\nmasks. Thus, there is great need to develop a generalized CNN-based\nsegmentation method which would be applicable for a wide variety of MR image\ndatasets with different tissue contrasts. The purpose of this study was to\ndevelop and evaluate a generalized CNN-based method for fully-automated\nsegmentation of different MR image datasets using a single set of annotated\ntraining data. A technique called cycle-consistent generative adversarial\nnetwork (CycleGAN) is applied as the core of the proposed method to perform\nimage-to-image translation between MR image datasets with different tissue\ncontrasts. A joint segmentation network is incorporated into the adversarial\nnetwork to obtain additional segmentation functionality. The proposed method\nwas evaluated for segmenting bone and cartilage on two clinical knee MR image\ndatasets acquired at our institution using only a single set of annotated data\nfrom a publicly available knee MR image dataset. The new technique may further\nimprove the applicability and efficiency of CNN-based segmentation of medical\nimages while eliminating the need for large amounts of annotated training data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Dec 2018 05:00:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-04"}

These graphs can be disconnected, although the correlation\nfunctions are themselves connected. In a recent work, the Schwinger-Dyson\nequations for an arbitrary albeit connected boundary were obtained.

However, changes of multi-temporal images are usually\ncomplex, existing methods are not effective enough. In recent years, deep\nnetwork has shown its brilliant performance in many fields including feature\nextraction and projection. Therefore, in this paper, based on deep network and\nslow feature analysis (SFA) theory, we proposed a new change detection\nalgorithm for multi-temporal remotes sensing images called Deep Slow Feature\nAnalysis (DSFA). In DSFA model, two symmetric deep networks are utilized for\nprojecting the input data of bi-temporal imagery. Then, the SFA module is\ndeployed to suppress the unchanged components and highlight the changed\ncomponents of the transformed features. The CVA pre-detection is employed to\nfind unchanged pixels with high confidence as training samples. Finally, the\nchange intensity is calculated with chi-square distance and the changes are\ndetermined by threshold algorithms.

On the other hand,\nbecause of wide deployment of data centers (DCs), we are seeing an increasing\nbidirectional traffic demand asymmetry, which leads to significant capacity\nwastage in designing and operating an optical transport network. To alleviate\nthese effects, for an MCF optical network, we propose to assign fiber cores in\nan MCF in an asymmetric and counter-propagating manner. This can not only\nsignificantly reduce inter-core crosstalk between counter-propagating fiber\ncores but also flexibly assign different numbers of fiber cores in the opposite\ndirections of a fiber link, thereby overcoming network capacity wastage due to\nthe bidirectional traffic demand asymmetry. To evaluate the benefits of the\nproposed strategy, we consider the routing, spectrum, and core assignment\n(RSCA) problem for the MCF optical network. An integer linear programming (ILP)\nmodel and an auxiliary graph (AG) based heuristic algorithm are developed to\noptimize network spectrum resource utilization. Simulation studies show the\neffectiveness of the proposed core counter-propagation strategy, which can\nsignificantly outperform its counterpart, i.e., the co-propagation scheme, in\nterms of the total number of MCFs used and average inter-core crosstalk.

However, the poor scalability of camera systems renders\nthem impractical in pursuit of the goal of wider adoption of HAR in mobile\ncomputing contexts. Consequently, researchers instead rely on wearable sensors\nand in particular inertial sensors. A particularly prevalent wearable is the\nsmart watch which due to its integrated inertial and optical sensing\ncapabilities holds great potential for realising better HAR in a non-obtrusive\nway. This paper seeks to simplify the wearable approach to HAR through\ndetermining if the wrist-mounted optical sensor alone typically found in a\nsmartwatch or similar device can be used as a useful source of data for\nactivity recognition. The approach has the potential to eliminate the need for\nthe inertial sensing element which would in turn reduce the cost of and\ncomplexity of smartwatches and fitness trackers.

As accelerators are\ngetting faster, the storage media \\& data buses feeding the data have not kept\npace and the ever increasing size of training data further compounds the\nproblem. We describe the design and implementation of a distributed caching\nsystem called Hoard that stripes the data across fast local disks of multiple\nGPU nodes using a distributed file system that efficiently feeds the data to\nensure minimal degradation in GPU utilization due to I/O starvation. Hoard can\ncache the data from a central storage system before the start of the job or\nduring the initial execution of the job and feeds the cached data for\nsubsequent epochs of the same job and for different invocations of the jobs\nthat share the same data requirements, e.g. hyper-parameter tuning. Hoard\nexposes a POSIX file system interface so the existing deep learning frameworks\ncan take advantage of the cache without any modifications. We show that Hoard,\nusing two NVMe disks per node and a distributed file system for caching,\nachieves a 2.1x speed-up over a 10Gb/s NFS central storage system on a 16 GPU\n(4 nodes, 4 GPUs per node) cluster for a challenging AlexNet ImageNet image\nclassification benchmark with 150GB of input dataset.

However, the framework of the\nt-SVD and the tensor tubal rank are applicable only to three-way tensors and\nlack of flexibility to handle different correlations along different modes. To\ntackle these two issues, we define a new tensor unfolding operator, named\nmode-$k_1k_2$ tensor unfolding, as the process of lexicographically stacking\nthe mode-$k_1k_2$ slices of an $N$-way tensor into a three-way tensor, which is\na three-way extension of the well-known mode-$k$ tensor matricization.

The assessment of cortical markers like cortical bone\nmineral density (BMD) and thickness is a demanding task, mainly because of the\nlimited spatial resolution of QCT. We propose a direct model based method to\nautomatically identify the surface through the center of the cortex of human\nvertebra. We develop a statistical bone model and analyze its probability\ndistribution after the imaging process. Using an as-rigid-as-possible\ndeformation we find the cortical surface that maximizes the likelihood of our\nmodel given the input volume. Using the European Spine Phantom (ESP) and a high\nresolution \\mu CT scan of a cadaveric vertebra, we show that the proposed\nmethod is able to accurately identify the real center of cortex ex-vivo. To\ndemonstrate the in-vivo applicability of our method we use manually obtained\nsurfaces for comparison.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Dec 2018 12:07:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-18"}

The main challenges in inverse degradation coefficient problems\n(IDCP) is the average flux measurement data only provide very limited\ninformation and cause the severe ill-posedness of IDCP. Firstly, we prove the\naverage flux measurement data can uniquely determine the degradation\ncoefficient. The existence and uniqueness of weak solution for the direct\nproblem are established, and the Lipschitz continuity of the corresponding\nforward operator is also obtained. Secondly, to overcome the ill-posedness, we\ncombine the variational regularization method with Laplace approximations (LA)\nto solve the IDCP. This hybrid method is essentially the combination of\ndeterministic regularization method and stochastic method. Thus, it is able to\ncalculate the minimizer (MAP point) more rapidly and accurately, but also\nenables captures the statistics information and quantifying the uncertainty of\nthe solution. Furthermore, the existence, stability and convergence of the\nminimizer of the variational problem are proved.

Although many studies have revealed the\ndynamics of various collective behaviours, their main focus was on the\ninformation process inside the collective, not on the whole system itself. For\nexample, the qualitative difference between two elements and three elements as\na system has rarely been investigated.

IIT\npostulates that the amount of information loss caused by certain partitions is\nequivalent to the degree of information integration in the system.

First, the mere definition of the model can be questioned: while most\napproaches so far proposed rely on the $L_2$-based model, we suggest an\nalternative (in some sense, more general) approach, based on the theory of\nReproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS).

It is important to find tracers that help\nquantifying the stellar feedback processes that take place at different scales.\nWe present ~85 arcmin^2 velocity-resolved maps of several submm molecular lines\ntoward the closest high-mass star-forming region, OMC-1. The observed\nrotational lines include probes of warm and dense molecular gas that are\ndifficult to detect from ground-based telescopes: CH+ (1-0), CO (10-9), HCO+\n(6-5), and HCN (6-5). These lines trace an extended but thin layer of molecular\ngas at high thermal pressure, P_th ~ 1e7-1e9 K/cm3, associated with the\nFUV-irradiated surface of OMC-1. The intense FUV field, emerging from massive\nstars in the Trapezium cluster, heats, compresses and photoevaporates the cloud\nedge. It also triggers the formation of reactive molecules such as CH+. The CH+\n(1-0) emission spatially correlates with the flux of FUV photons impinging the\ncloud: G_0 from 1e3 to 1e5. This correlation is supported by isobaric PDR\nmodels in the parameter space P_th/G_0 ~ [5e3-8e4] K/cm3 where many PDRs seem\nto lie. The CH+ (1-0) emission correlates with the extended emission from\nvibrationally excited H2, and with that of [CII]158um and CO 10-9, all emerging\nfrom FUV-irradiated gas. These correlations link the presence of CH+ to the\navailability of C+ ions and of FUV-pumped H2(v>0) molecules. The parsec-scale\nCH+ emission and narrow-line (dv ~ 3 km/s) mid-J CO emission arises from\nextended PDRs and not from fast shocks. PDR line tracers are the smoking gun of\nthe stellar feedback from young massive stars.

In this paper we\nbuild on extensive work elucidating the semantics of assembler-level languages\non hardware architectures with weak memory models (specifically TSO, ARM and\nPOWER) and lift the principles to a straightforward operational semantics which\nallows reasoning at a higher level of abstraction. To this end we introduce a\nwide-spectrum language that encompasses operations on abstract data types as\nwell as low-level assembler code, define its operational semantics using a\nnovel approach to allowing reordering of instructions, and derive some\nrefinement laws that can be used to explain behaviours of real processors.

Only relatively\nsmall number of electron states close to the Fermi surface are diamagnetically\nactive whereas the majority of the electron states inside the Fermi surface are\ndiamagnetically inert. This partitioning of the occupied electron states is\ndriven by the structure of Landau levels, around which one can introduce\nmagnetic tubes in the reciprocal space. Completely filled magnetic tubes do not\nchange their energy in an applied magnetic field, and only partially occupied\nmagnetic tubes in the neighborhood of the Fermi surface exhibit a diamagnetic\nresponse. Using this partitioning of the occupied electron states we derive a\ngeneral expression for the steady diamagnetic susceptibility, for calculation\nof which one needs to know the shape of the Fermi surface and the energy\ngradient on it. The method is applied to alkali metals, whose Fermi surfaces\nand energy gradients have been obtained from ab initio band structure\ncalculations. It has been found that the Landau diamagnetic susceptibility is\nanisotropic depending on the direction of the applied magnetic field in respect\nto the Fermi surface. This effect is more pronounced for Li and Cs, whose Fermi\nsurfaces show a noticeable deformation from the spherical shape. The method\nopens a new route for ab initio calculations of the Landau diamagnetism of\nmetals or intermetallic compounds. In the case of free electron gas it is shown\nthat this approach also fully describes the oscillatory de Haas - van Alphen\npart of the diamagnetic susceptibility.

One mechanism for deforming the cell\nmembrane into the desired shape is through the expression of curved membrane\nproteins.

This coupling between curvature and activity was\npreviously explored theoretically in the linear limit of small deformations,\nand low dimensionality. Here we explore the unrestricted shapes of vesicles\nthat contain active curved membrane proteins, in three-dimensions, using\nMonte-Carlo numerical simulations. The activity of the proteins is in the form\nof protrusive forces that push the membrane outwards, as may arise from the\ncytoskeleton of the cell due to actin or microtubule polymerization occurring\nnear the membrane. For proteins that have an isotropic convex shape, the\nadditional protrusive force enhances their tendency to aggregate and form\nmembrane protrusions (buds). In addition, we find another transition from\ndeformed spheres with necklace type aggregates, to flat pancake-shaped\nvesicles, where the curved proteins line the outer rim. This second transition\nis driven by the active forces, coupled to the spontaneous curvature, and the\nresulting configurations may shed light on the organization of the lamellipodia\nof adhered and motile cells.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Dec 2018 15:23:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-05"}

Although training and testing are performed on different subsets of\nthe dataset, models built on one study show limited capability to generalize to\nother studies. While database bias has been recognized as a serious problem in\nthe computer vision community, it has remained largely unnoticed in medical\nimaging research. Transfer learning thus remains confined to the re-use of\nfeature representations requiring re-training on the new dataset. As a result,\nmachine learning models do not generalize even when trained on imaging datasets\nthat were captured to study the same variable of interest. The ability to\ntransfer knowledge gleaned from one study to another, without the need for\nre-training, if possible, would provide reassurance that the models are\nlearning knowledge fundamental to the problem under study instead of latching\nonto the idiosyncracies of a dataset. In this paper, we situate the problem of\ndataset bias in the context of medical imaging studies. We show empirical\nevidence that such a problem exists in medical datasets. We then present a\nframework to unlearn study membership as a means to handle the problem of\ndatabase bias.

We\nstudy the impact of those challenges on the performance of LiFi in an indoor\nenvironment using measurement-based channel models. We adopt spatial modulation\n(SM), which has been shown to be energy efficient in many applications,\nincluding LiFi. We consider two configurations for placing the photodiodes\n(PDs) on the user equipment (UE). The first one is referred to as the screen\nreceiver (SR) whereby all the PDs are located on one face of the UE, whereas\nthe other one is a multi-directional receiver (MDR), in which the PDs are\nlocated on different sides of the UE. The latter configuration was motivated by\nthe fact that SR exhibited poor performance in the presence of random device\norientation and blockage. We show that MDR outperforms SR by over $10$ dB at\nBER of $3.8\\times10^{-3}$. Moreover, an adaptive access point (AP) selection\nscheme for SM is considered where the number of APs are chosen adaptively in an\neffort to achieve the lowest energy requirement for a target BER and spectral\nefficiency. The user performance with random orientation and blockage in the\nwhole room is evaluated for sitting and walking activities. For the latter, we\ninvoke the orientation-based random waypoint (ORWP) mobility model. We also\nstudy the performance of the underlying system on the uplink channel where the\nsame techniques are used for the downlink channel. Specifically, as the\ntransmitted uplink power is constrained, the energy efficiency of SM is\nevaluated analytically. It is shown that the multi-directional transmitter\n(MDT) with adaptive SM is highly energy efficient. As a benchmark, we compare\nthe performance of the proposed framework to that of the conventional spatial\nmultiplexing system, and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Dec 2018 21:11:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-10"}
