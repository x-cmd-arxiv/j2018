In this configuration the magnetic forces are\nbalanced by a pressure force caused by a toroidal depression in the pressure.\nEquilibrium is attained when this low pressure region prevents further\nexpansion into the higher-pressure external plasma. We find that, for the\nparameters investigated, the resistive evolution of the structures follows a\nuniversal pattern when rescaled to resistive time. The finite resistivity\ncauses both a decrease in the magnetic field strength and a finite slip of the\nplasma fluid against the static equilibrium. This slip is caused by a\nPfirsch-Schl\\\"uter type diffusion, similar to what is seen in tokamak\nequilibria. The net effect is that the configuration remains in Magnetostatic\nequilibrium whilst it slowly grows in size. The rotational transform of the\nstructure becomes nearly constant throughout the entire structure, and\ndecreases according to a power law. In simulations this equilibrium is observed\nwhen highly tangled field lines relax in a high-pressure (relative to the\nmagnetic field strength) environment, a situation that occurs when the twisted\nfield of a coronal loop is ejected into the interplanetary solar wind. In this\npaper we relate this localized MHD equilibrium to magnetic clouds in the solar\nwind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Dec 2018 17:07:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

The improved\ninterpretability is believed to offer a sense of security by involving human in\nthe decision-making process. Yet, due to its data-driven nature, the\ninterpretability itself is potentially susceptible to malicious manipulations,\nabout which little is known thus far.\n  Here we bridge this gap by conducting the first systematic study on the\nsecurity of interpretable deep learning systems (IDLSes). We show that existing\n\\imlses are highly vulnerable to adversarial manipulations. Specifically, we\npresent ADV^2, a new class of attacks that generate adversarial inputs not only\nmisleading target DNNs but also deceiving their coupled interpretation models.\nThrough empirical evaluation against four major types of IDLSes on benchmark\ndatasets and in security-critical applications (e.g., skin cancer diagnosis),\nwe demonstrate that with ADV^2 the adversary is able to arbitrarily designate\nan input's prediction and interpretation. Further, with both analytical and\nempirical evidence, we identify the prediction-interpretation gap as one root\ncause of this vulnerability -- a DNN and its interpretation model are often\nmisaligned, resulting in the possibility of exploiting both models\nsimultaneously. Finally, we explore potential countermeasures against ADV^2,\nincluding leveraging its low transferability and incorporating it in an\nadversarial training framework.

To alleviate this problem, we present a similarity constrained\nalignment (SCA) method for unsupervised domain adaptation.

We\nuse sample median estimation after the Berger-Tung scheme for achievability.\nThe other setting is a \\emph{non-regular} source-observation model, including\nuniform additive noise models, with $r$th power of difference distortion for\nwhich estimation-theoretic regularity conditions do not hold. The distortion\ndecay $\\mathcal{O}(R_{sum}^{-r})$ when $r \\ge 1$ is obtained for the\nnon-regular model by midrange estimator following the Berger-Tung scheme. We\nalso provide converses based on the Shannon lower bound for the regular model\nand the Chazan-Zakai-Ziv bound for the non-regular model, respectively. Lastly,\nwe provide a sufficient condition for the regular model, under which quadratic\nand logarithmic distortions are asymptotically equivalent by an entropy power\nrelationship as the number of agents grows. This proof relies on the\nBernstein-von Mises theorem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Dec 2018 17:03:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2018 19:49:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 28 Feb 2020 17:46:32 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2022 17:04:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-05"}

By analyzing the Git commits, snapshot by snapshot, we\nare also able to analyze the \"age\" of policy rules, the trend of changes, and\nthe contributor composition. We also look at hallmark events in Android's\nhistory, such as the \"Stagefright\" vulnerability in Android's media facilities,\npointing out how these events led to changes in the MAC policies. The growing\ncomplexity of Android's mandatory policies suggests that we will eventually hit\nthe limits of our ability to understand these policies, requiring new tools and\ntechniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Dec 2018 17:23:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-04"}

In many real-world applications, the agents can only acquire a partial\nview of the world. Here we consider a setting whereby most agents' observations\nare also extremely noisy, hence only weakly correlated to the true state of the\nenvironment. Under these circumstances, learning an optimal policy becomes\nparticularly challenging, even in the unrealistic case that an agent's policy\ncan be made conditional upon all other agents' observations. To overcome these\ndifficulties, we propose a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient\nalgorithm enhanced by a communication medium (MADDPG-M), which implements a\ntwo-level, concurrent learning mechanism. An agent's policy depends on its own\nprivate observations as well as those explicitly shared by others through a\ncommunication medium. At any given point in time, an agent must decide whether\nits private observations are sufficiently informative to be shared with others.\nHowever, our environments provide no explicit feedback informing an agent\nwhether a communication action is beneficial, rather the communication policies\nmust also be learned through experience concurrently to the main policies. Our\nexperimental results demonstrate that the algorithm performs well in six highly\nnon-stationary environments of progressively higher complexity, and offers\nsubstantial performance gains compared to the baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Dec 2018 17:27:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-04"}

In its standard form, the method\nrequires the specification of the number of iterations in advance. If the\nselected number of iterations is not enough, the entire data assimilation must\nbe restarted. Moreover, ES-MDA also requires the selection of data-error\ncovariance inflations. The typical choice is to select constant values.\nHowever, previous works indicate that starting with large inflation and\ngradually decreasing during the data assimilation steps may improve the quality\nof the final models.\n  This paper presents an analysis of the use of geometrically decreasing\nsequences of the data-error covariance inflations. In particular, the paper\ninvestigates a recently introduced procedure based on the singular values of a\nsensitivity matrix computed from the prior ensemble. The paper also introduces\na novel procedure to select the inflation factors. The performance of the data\nassimilation schemes is evaluated in three reservoir history-matching problems\nwith increasing level of complexity. The first problem is a small synthetic\ncase which illustrates that the standard ES-MDA scheme with constant inflation\nmay result in overcorrection of the permeability field and that a geometric\nsequence can alleviate this problem. The second problem is a recently published\nbenchmark and the third one is a field case with real production data. The data\nassimilation schemes are compared in terms of a data-mismatch and a\nmodel-change norm. The first norm evaluates the ability of the models to\nreproduce the observed data. The second norm evaluates the amount of changes in\nthe prior model. The results indicate that geometric inflations can generate\nsolutions with good balance between the two norms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Dec 2018 17:28:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-04"}

Our model uses aligned-pair and/or\npseudo-label losses to adapt an object detector to the target domain, and can\nlearn transformations with or without densely labeled data in the source (e.g.\nsemantic segmentation annotations). Without dense labels, as is the case when\nonly detection labels are available in the source, transformations are learned\nusing CycleGAN alignment. Otherwise, when dense labels are available we\nintroduce a more efficient cycle-free method, which exploits pixel-level\nsemantic labels to condition the training of the transformation network.

Roughly, the distribution\nprivacy of a local obfuscation mechanism means that the attacker cannot\nsignificantly gain any information on the distribution of the mechanism's input\nby observing its output. Then we show that existing local mechanisms can hide\ninput distributions in terms of distribution privacy, while deteriorating the\nutility by adding too much noise. For example, we prove that the Laplace\nmechanism needs to add a large amount of noise proportionally to the infinite\nWasserstein distance between the two distributions we want to make\nindistinguishable. To improve the tradeoff between distribution privacy and\nutility, we introduce a local obfuscation mechanism, called a tupling\nmechanism, that adds random dummy data to the output. Then we apply this\nmechanism to the protection of user attributes in location based services.

Popular instances of time-evolving data include flocking/swarming\nbehaviors in animals and social networks in the human sphere. A natural\nmathematical model for such collective behaviors is a dynamic point cloud, or\nmore generally a dynamic metric space (DMS).\n  In this paper we extend the Rips filtration stability result for (static)\nmetric spaces to the setting of DMSs. We do this by devising a certain\nthree-parameter \"spatiotemporal\" filtration of a DMS. Applying the homology\nfunctor to this filtration gives rise to multidimensional persistence module\nderived from the DMS. We show that this multidimensional module enjoys\nstability under a suitable generalization of the Gromov-Hausdorff distance\nwhich permits metrizing the collection of all DMSs.\n  On the other hand, it is recognized that, in general, comparing two\nmultidimensional persistence modules leads to intractable computational\nproblems. For the purpose of practical comparison of DMSs, we focus on both the\nrank invariant or the dimension function of the multidimensional persistence\nmodule that is derived from a DMS. We specifically propose to utilize a certain\nmetric d for comparing these invariants: In our work this d is either (1) a\ncertain generalization of the erosion distance by Patel, or (2) a specialized\nversion of the well known interleaving distance.

In this\nwork we explore the non-linear dynamics of those modes in a conformal fluid.\nAmong all possible SOTs, we choose to work with the Divergence Type Theories\n(DTT) formalism, which ensures that the second law of thermodynamics is\nsatisfied non-perturbatively. In considering a perturbative scheme within this\nformalism, at next to leading order a set of Maxwell-Cattaneo equations is\nobtained, as in e.g. Israel-Stewart theories. The tensor modes include two\ndivergence-free modes which have no analog in theories based on covariant\nNavier-Stokes equations, and that are particularly relevant because they may\ncouple linearly to a gravitational field. To study the dynamics of this\nirreducible tensor sector, we observe that in causal theories such as DTTs,\nthermal fluctuations induce a stochastic stirring force in the equations of\nmotion, which excites the tensor modes while preserving energy momentum\nconservation. From fluctuation-dissipation considerations, it follows that the\nrandom force is Gaussian with a white spectrum. The irreducible tensor modes in\nturn excite vector modes, which back-react on the tensor sector, thus producing\na consistent non-linear, second order description of the divergence-free tensor\ndynamics. Using the Martin-Siggia-Rose (MSR) formalism we obtain the two-point\ncorrelation function for these tensor modes at next to leading order, and the\ninduced stochastic component of the energy-momentum tensor.

This work presents a theoretical\naccount of such expected signatures, particularly that of a geometry induced\nphase-offset in subpulse modulation, including various formulae that can be\nreadily applied to observations. A notable result is a method to resolve\naliasing in the measured subpulse modulation period without relying on\nknowledge of the viewing geometry parameters. It is also shown in detail that\nthe geometry induced phase-offset enables critical tests of various observed\nphenomena as well as proposed hypotheses, e.g., multi-altitude emission,\nmagnetic field twisting, pseudo-nulls, etc., in addition to that of the\ncarousel model itself. Finally, a detailed analysis of a 327 MHz pulse-sequence\nof PSR B1237+25 is presented as a case study to test the single-frequency\nmulti-altitude emission scenario. The analysis provides a firm evidence of\ninner and outer conal components of this pulsar to have originated from the\nsame carousel of subbeams and emitted at different heights.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Dec 2018 19:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

If our Solar System were observed with present-day Earth\ntechnology -- to put our system and exoplanets on the same footing -- Jupiter\nis the only planet that would be detectable. The statistics of exo-Jupiters\nindicate that the Solar System is unusual at the ~1% level among Sun-like stars\n(or ~0.1% among all stars). But why are we different?\n  Successful formation models for both the Solar System and exoplanet systems\nrely on two key processes: orbital migration and dynamical instability. Systems\nof close-in super-Earths or sub-Neptunes require substantial radial inward\nmotion of solids either as drifting mm- to cm-sized pebbles or migrating\nEarth-mass or larger planetary embryos. We argue that, regardless of their\nformation mode, the late evolution of super-Earth systems involves migration\ninto chains of mean motion resonances, generally followed by instability when\nthe disk dissipates. This pattern is likely also ubiquitous in giant planet\nsystems. We present three models for inner Solar System formation -- the\nlow-mass asteroid belt, Grand Tack, and Early Instability models -- each\ninvoking a combination of migration and instability.\n  We identify bifurcation points in planetary system formation. We present a\nseries of events to explain why our Solar System is so weird.

An essential but missing ingredient for understanding and\ndeploying QAOA is a constructive approach to carry out the outer-loop classical\noptimization. We provide an in-depth study of the performance of QAOA on MaxCut\nproblems by developing an efficient parameter-optimization procedure and\nrevealing its ability to exploit non-adiabatic operations. Building on observed\npatterns in optimal parameters, we propose heuristic strategies for\ninitializing optimizations to find quasi-optimal $p$-level QAOA parameters in\n$O(\\text{poly}(p))$ time, whereas the standard strategy of random\ninitialization requires $2^{O(p)}$ optimization runs to achieve similar\nperformance. We then benchmark QAOA and compare it with quantum annealing,\nespecially on difficult instances where adiabatic quantum annealing fails due\nto small spectral gaps. The comparison reveals that QAOA can learn via\noptimization to utilize non-adiabatic mechanisms to circumvent the challenges\nassociated with vanishing spectral gaps. Finally, we provide a realistic\nresource analysis on the experimental implementation of QAOA. When quantum\nfluctuations in measurements are accounted for, we illustrate that optimization\nwill be important only for problem sizes beyond numerical simulations, but\naccessible on near-term devices. We propose a feasible implementation of large\nMaxCut problems with a few hundred vertices in a system of 2D neutral atoms,\nreaching the regime to challenge the best classical algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Dec 2018 19:25:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 9 Nov 2019 22:53:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-26"}

However, due to the highly heterogeneous\nappearance and shape, segmentation of the sub-regions is very challenging.\nRecent development using deep learning models has proved its effectiveness in\nthe past several brain segmentation challenges as well as other semantic and\nmedical image segmentation problems. Most models in brain tumor segmentation\nuse a 2D/3D patch to predict the class label for the center voxel and variant\npatch sizes and scales are used to improve the model performance. However, it\nhas low computation efficiency and also has limited receptive field. U-Net is a\nwidely used network structure for end-to-end segmentation and can be used on\nthe entire image or extracted patches to provide classification labels over the\nentire input voxels so that it is more efficient and expect to yield better\nperformance with larger input size. Furthermore, instead of picking the best\nnetwork structure, an ensemble of multiple models, trained on different dataset\nor different hyper-parameters, can generally improve the segmentation\nperformance. In this study we propose to use an ensemble of 3D U-Nets with\ndifferent hyper-parameters for brain tumor segmentation. Preliminary results\nshowed effectiveness of this model.

The long integration times, the arcsec-level angular\nresolution of OmegaCam@VST and the large covered area of FDS allow us to map\nthe light and color distributions out to large galactocentric distances (up to\nabout 10-15 R_e) and surface brightness levels beyond mu_r = 27 mag/arcsec^2\n(mu_B > 28 mag/arcsec^2).

Here,\nwavelets are used to study the onset and subsequent transition to fully\ndeveloped turbulence from a laminar state. Originally applied to neutral fluid\nturbulence, an iterative wavelet technique decomposes the field into coherent\nand incoherent contributions. In contrast to Fourier power spectra, finite time\nLyapunov exponents (FTLE), and simple measures of intermittency such as\nnon-Gaussian statistics of field increments, the wavelet technique is found to\nprovide a quantitative measure for the onset of turbulence and to track the\ntransition to fully developed turbulence. The wavelet method makes no\nassumptions about the structure of the coherent current sheets or the\nunderlying plasma model. Temporal evolution of the coherent and incoherent\nwavelet fluctuations is found to be highly correlated with the magnetic field\nenergy and plasma thermal energy, respectively. The onset of turbulence is\nidentified with the rapid growth of a background of incoherent fluctuations\nspreading across a range of scales and a corresponding drop in the coherent\ncomponents. This is suggestive of the interpretation of the coherent and\nincoherent wavelet fluctuations as measures of coherent structures (e.g.,\ncurrent sheets) and dissipation, respectively. The ratio of the incoherent to\ncoherent fluctuations $R_{ic}$ is found to be fairly uniform across different\nplasma models and provides an empirical threshold for turbulence onset. The\ntechnique is illustrated through examples. First, it is applied to the\nKelvin--Helmholtz instability from different simulation models including fully\nkinetic, hybrid (kinetic ion/fluid electron), and Hall MHD simulations. Second,\nit is applied to the development of turbulence downstream of the bowshock in a\nmagnetosphere simulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Dec 2018 19:47:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-13"}

A key\naspect of our work is the modeling of single-cell variability by assigning a\nprobability distribution to intervals of initial concentration values and\nkinetic rate constants. We propagate this distribution through the system\ndynamics to obtain a distribution over the set of trajectories of the ODEs.\nThis in turn opens the door for performing statistical analysis of the ODE\nsystem's behavior. To illustrate this we first encode quantitative data and\nqualitative trends as bounded linear time temporal logic (BLTL) formulas. Based\non this we construct a parameter estimation method using an SMC-driven\nevaluation procedure applied to the stochastic version of the behavior of the\nODE system. We then describe how this SMC framework can be generalized to\nhybrid automata by exploiting the given distribution over the initial states\nand the--much more sophisticated--system dynamics to associate a Markov chain\nwith the hybrid automaton. We then establish a strong relationship between the\nbehaviors of the hybrid automaton and its associated Markov chain.\nConsequently, we sample trajectories from the hybrid automaton in a way that\nmimics the sampling of the trajectories of the Markov chain. This enables us to\nverify approximately that the Markov chain meets a BLTL specification with high\nprobability.

Given the\nmultiplicity of Higgs states in a 2HDM, its Higgs potential is significantly\nmore involved than the SM one. Importantly, it contains a multitude of Higgs\ntriple self-couplings, unlike the SM, which only has one. These interactions\nare key to understanding the phenomenology of the 2HDM, as they uniquely\ndetermine the form of the potential. Several studies analysing the prospects of\nmeasuring these couplings at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have found them to\nbe quite low generally. However, such studies have largely concentrated on\nHiggs pair-production induced by gluon-gluon scattering, either via direct\nannihilation or followed by their splitting into $b$-(anti)quark pairs, which\nin turn annihilate leaving behind spectator $b$-(anti)quarks. Both of these\nchannels are therefore governed by QCD dynamics. We compare here the yields of\nsuch channels to those initiated by (primarily) valence quarks, which involve\nElectro-Weak (EW) interactions only, for neutral multi-Higgs final states. We\nfind that EW production can be dominant over QCD production for certain final\nstate combinations. We also illustrate that charged final states, which can\nonly be produced via EW modes, could serve as important probes of some $H^\\pm$\ntriple couplings, that are inaccessible in QCD-induced processes, during Run 2\nand 3 of the LHC. Our analysis covers regions of the parameter space of the\nType-I 2HDM that have escaped the most up-to-date experimental constraints\ncoming from EW precision data, LHC measurements of the 125 GeV Higgs boson\nproperties, searches for additional Higgs states, and flavour physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2018 00:50:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2019 14:28:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-19"}

The key idea in\ncross-classification is to efficiently turn a clustering problem into a\nclassification problem by running a logarithmic number of independent\nclassifications per image, letting the cross-labeling of these classifications\nuniquely classify each pixel to the object labels. We apply the 3C mechanism to\nachieve state-of-the-art accuracy in connectomics -- the nanoscale mapping of\nneural tissue from electron microscopy volumes.

It collects samples from a networked population\nby incentivizing participants to refer their friends into the study. One major\nchallenge in analyzing RDS samples is seed bias. Seed bias refers to the fact\nthat when the social network is divided into multiple communities (or blocks),\nthe RDS sample might not provide a balanced representation of the different\ncommunities in the population, and such unbalance is correlated with the\ninitial participant (or the seed). In this case, the distributions of\nestimators are typically non-trivial mixtures, which are determined (1) by the\nseed and (2) by how the referrals transition from one block to another. This\npaper shows that (1) block-transition probabilities are easy to estimate with\nhigh accuracy, and (2) we can use these estimated block-transition\nprobabilities to estimate the stationary distribution over blocks and thus, an\nestimate of the block proportions. This stationary distribution on blocks has\npreviously been used in the RDS literature to evaluate whether the sampling\nprocess has appeared to `mix'. We use these estimated block proportions in a\nsimple post-stratified (PS) estimator that greatly diminishes seed bias. By\naggregating over the blocks/strata in this way, we prove that the PS estimator\nis $\\sqrt{n}$-consistent under a Markov model, even when other estimators are\nnot. Simulations show that the PS estimator has smaller Root Mean Square Error\n(RMSE) compared to the state-of-the-art estimators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2018 03:08:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-21"}

This research focuses on the fast reconnection\nphase when plasmoids form and produce small-scale structures inside the flare\ncurrent sheet.

Given the grammar\n(which is often publicly available) of test inputs, we introduce a\ngrammar-aware trimming strategy to trim test inputs at the tree level using the\nabstract syntax trees (ASTs) of parsed test inputs. Further, we introduce two\ngrammar-aware mutation strategies (i.e., enhanced dictionary-based mutation and\ntree-based mutation). Specifically, tree-based mutation works via replacing\nsubtrees using the ASTs of parsed test inputs. Equipped with grammar-awareness,\nour approach can carry the fuzzing exploration into width and depth.\n  We implemented our approach as an extension to AFL, named Superion; and\nevaluated the effectiveness of Superion on real-life large-scale programs (a\nXML engine libplist and three JavaScript engines WebKit, Jerryscript and\nChakraCore).

To measure\nthe BIP for wireless VR users, a novel model that jointly considers the VR\napplication type, transmission delay, VR video quality, and users' awareness of\nthe virtual environment is proposed. In the developed model, the base stations\n(BSs) transmit VR videos to the wireless VR users using directional\ntransmission links so as to provide high data rates for the VR users, thus,\nreducing the number of BIP for each user. Since the body movements of a VR user\nmay result in a blockage of its wireless link, the location and orientation of\nVR users must also be considered when minimizing BIP. The BIP minimization\nproblem is formulated as an optimization problem which jointly considers the\npredictions of users' locations, orientations, and their BS association.

Furthermore, the efficiency of\nachieving reliability using spare units heavily depends on the replacement\nmechanisms of such spares. While global and chained replacement approaches can\ntake advantage of the entire replacement capabilities in the network, they\nusually impose some sort of disturbance to all the functional units in the\nsystem during the repair process, thus are dreadfully expensive in terms of\nperformance overhead for systems with high fault rates.

Typical superalkalis include a central electronegative core with\nexcess metal ligands. We propose a new series of non-metallic NnH3n+1+\nsuperalkali cations using MP2/6-311++G(d,p) level. These cations are designed\nby successive replacement of H-ligands of ammonium cation (NH4+) by ammonium\n(NH4) moieties. The resulting NnH3n+1+ cations, which can be expressed in the\nform of [NH4 (n-1)NH3]+ complexes, possess a number of unusual N-H N type of\npartially covalent H-bonds, with the interacting energy in the range 7.8-24.3\nkcal/mol. These cations are stable against loss of a proton (NnH3n+H+) and loss\nof ammonia [(n-1)NH3+NH4+]. The vertical electron affinities (EAv) of NnH3n+1+\ndecreases monotonically from 4.39 eV from n = 1 to 2.39 eV for n = 5, which\nsuggest their superalkali nature. This can be explained on the basis of\nelectron localization on core (central) N-atom (Qc), as EAv correlates linearly\nwith Qc. We have also demonstrated that this series may be continued to obtain\nnew superalkali cations with even lower EAv, by exemplifying N9H28+ with the\nEAv of 1.84 eV. N9H28+ is stabilized by four partially covalent H-bonds (8.5\nkcal/mol each) and four electrostatic H-bonds (0.4 kcal/mol each). This led to\nan exponential relation between EAv and n, which may provide an approximate EAv\nof for any value of n in NnH3n+1+ series.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2018 04:38:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-05"}

Existing CSI acquisition methods usually rely on pilot\ntransmissions, and geographically separated base stations (BSs) with\nnon-correlated CSI need to be assigned with orthogonal pilots which occupy\nexcessive system resources. Our previous work adopts a data-driven deep\nlearning based approach which leverages the CSI at a local BS to infer the CSI\nremotely, however the relevance of CSI between separated BSs is not specified\nexplicitly. In this paper, we exploit a model-based methodology to derive the\nCram\\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of remote CSI inference given the local CSI.\nAlthough the model is simplified, the derived CRLB explicitly illustrates the\nrelationship between the inference performance and several key system\nparameters, e.g., terminal distance and antenna array size. In particular, it\nshows that by leveraging multiple local BSs, the inference error exhibits a\nlarger power-law decay rate (w.r.t. number of antennas), compared with a single\nlocal BS; this explains and validates our findings in evaluating the\ndeep-neural-network-based (DNN-based) CSI inference.

In absence of any actions of the\ncompany, the commodity's spot price evolves either as a drifted Brownian motion\nor as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. While extracting, the company affects the\nmarket price of the commodity, and its actions have an impact on the dynamics\nof the commodity's spot price. The company aims at maximizing the total\nexpected profits from selling the commodity, net of the total expected\nproportional costs of extraction. We model this problem as a two-dimensional\ndegenerate singular stochastic control problem with finite fuel. To determine\nits solution, we construct an explicit solution to the associated\nHamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, and then verify its actual optimality through\na verification theorem. On the one hand, when the (uncontrolled) price is a\ndrifted Brownian motion, it is optimal to extract whenever the current price\nlevel is larger or equal than an endogenously determined constant threshold. On\nthe other hand, when the (uncontrolled) price evolves as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck\nprocess, we show that the optimal extraction rule is triggered by a curve\ndepending on the current level of the reservoir.

A straightforward approach for event\ndetection tasks is to train a detection network from a large-scale dataset in\nan end-to-end manner. However, in many applications such as building change\ndetection on satellite images, few positive samples are available for the\ntraining. Moreover, scene image pairs contain many trivial events, such as in\nillumination changes or background motions. These many trivial events and the\nclass imbalance problem lead to false alarms for rare event detection. In order\nto overcome these difficulties, we propose a novel method to learn disentangled\nrepresentations from only low-cost negative samples. The proposed method\ndisentangles different aspects in a pair of observations: variant and invariant\nfactors that represent trivial events and image contents, respectively. The\neffectiveness of the proposed approach is verified by the quantitative\nevaluations on four change detection datasets, and the qualitative analysis\nshows that the proposed method can acquire the representations that disentangle\nrare events from trivial ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2018 09:05:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-05"}

These systems often consist of interacting subsystems,\nwhose characterization is of importance for a complete understanding of the\nbrain interaction processes. To address this issue, we present a technique,\nnamely the bispectral Pairwise Interacting Source Analysis (biPISA), for\nanalyzing systems of cross-frequency interacting brain sources when\nmultichannel electroencephalographic (EEG) or magnetoencephalographic (MEG)\ndata are available. Specifically, the biPISA allows to identify one or many\nsubsystems of cross-frequency interacting sources by decomposing the\nantisymmetric components of the cross-bispectra between EEG or MEG signals,\nbased on the assumption that interactions are pairwise. Thanks to the\nproperties of the antisymmetric components of the cross-bispectra, biPISA is\nalso robust to spurious interactions arising from mixing artifacts, i.e. volume\nconduction or field spread, which always affect EEG or MEG functional\nconnectivity estimates. This method is an extension of the Pairwise Interacting\nSource Analysis (PISA), which was originally introduced for investigating\ninteractions at the same frequency, to the study of cross-frequency\ninteractions. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated in simulations\nfor up to three interacting source pairs, and for real MEG recordings of\nspontaneous brain activity. Simulations show that the performances of biPISA in\nestimating the phase difference between the interacting sources are affected by\nthe increasing level of noise rather than by the number of the interacting\nsubsystems.

If such a failure were to occur\non the HL-LHC crab cavities, it is likely that the machine would sustain\nsubstantial damage to the beam line and surrounding infrastructure due to\nuncontrolled beam loss before the machine protection system could dump the\nbeam. We have developed a low-level RF system model, including detuning\nmechanisms and beam loading, and use this to simulate the behaviour of a crab\ncavity during a quench, modeling the low-level RF system, detuning mechanisms\nand beam loading. We supplement this with measurement data of the actual RF\nresponse of the proof of principle Double-Quarter Wave Crab Cravity during a\nquench. Extrapolating these measurements to the HL-LHC, we show that Lorentz\nForce detuning is the dominant effect leading to phase shifts in the crab\ncavity during quenches; rather than pressure detuning which is expected to be\ndominant for the KEKB crab cavities. The total frequency shift for the HL-LHC\ncrab cavities during quenches is expected to be about 460 Hz, leading to a\nphase shift of no more than 3o. The results of the quench model are read into a\nparticle tracking simulation, SixTrack, and used to determine the effect of\nquenches on the HL-LHC beam. The quench model has been benchmarked against the\nKEKB experimental measurements. In this paper we present the results of the\nsimulations on a crab cavity failure for HL-LHC as well as for the SPS and show\nthat beam loss is negligible when using a realistic low-level RF response.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2018 10:08:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-24"}

Recently, there has been an increased interest in estimating causal\neffects of treatment received, for example the so-called local average\ntreatment effect (LATE). Instrumental variables (IV) methods can be used for\nidentification, with estimation proceeding either via fully parametric mixture\nmodels or two-stage least squares (TSLS).

The existing credit\nnetwork research either took a macro perspective to clarify the topological\nproperties of financial systems at a descriptive level or analyzed the risk\ntransmission path and characteristics of individual entities with much\npre-assumptions of the network. Here, we used the theory of complex network to\nmodel China's credit system from 2000 to 2014 based on actual financial data. A\nbipartite financial institution-firm network and its projected sub-networks\nwere constructed for an integrated analysis from both macro and micro\nperspectives, and the relationship between typological properties and\nsystematic credit risk control was also explored. The typological analysis of\nthe networks suggested that the financial institutions and firms were highly\nbut asymmetrically connected, and the credit network structure made local\nidiosyncratic shocks possible to proliferate through the whole economy. In\naddition, the Chinese credit market was still dominated by state-owned\nfinancial institutions with firms competing fiercely for financial resources in\nthe past fifteen years. Furthermore, the credit risk score (CRS) was introduced\nby simulation to identify the systematically important vertices in terms of\nsystematic risk control. The results indicated that the vertices with more\naccess to the credit market or less likelihood to be a bridge in the network\nwere the ones with higher systematically importance. The empirical results from\nthis study would provide specific policy suggestions to financial regulators on\nsupervisory approaches and optimizing the allocation of regulatory resources to\nenhance the robustness of credit systems in China and in other countries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2018 11:16:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-05"}

We applied here measures taken from Recurrence\nQuantification Analysis, Mean State Shift (MSS) and State Variance (SV) which\nwere previously used to detect changes in brain-state dynamics after TMS. The\nstudied cohort comprised of 16 healthy subjects; all subjects received anodal\nand cathodal tDCS, which were given in two separate sessions on the same day.\nThe EEG was recorded from 10 electrodes, positioned over left motor cortex and\nmirroring right cortex corresponding to 10/20 standard.

After calculating MSS and SV on those epochs and statistical\ntesting for a significant difference, we applied Principal Component Analysis\n(PCA) on the same time series to check whether the data are separable. The\nresults show that tDCS exert polarity specific effects on the MSS as shown by\nsignificantly lower MSS values after cathodal stimulation compared to anodal\nstimulation. Cathodal stimulation affected the SV, as compared to anodal\nstimulation, which did not lead to detectable changes.

Recently, the induced\nmagnetic structure by in-plane applied fields has been investigated by means of\nspin-polarized neutron diffraction, which allowed to extract a substantial\norbital component of the magnetic densities at Ru sites. It has been argued\nthat the latter is at the origin of the evident layer dependent magnetic\nanisotropy, where the inner layers carry larger magnetic moments than the outer\nones. We present a spin-polarized neutron diffraction study in order to\ncharacterize the nature of the ferromagnetic state of Sr4Ru3O10, in the\npresence of a magnetic field applied along the c-axis. The components of the\nmagnetic densities at the Ru sites reveal a vanishing contribution of the\norbital magnetic moment which is unexpected for a material system where orbital\nand spin degeneracy are lifted by spin-orbit coupling and ferromagnetism. We\nemploy a model that includes the Coulomb interaction and spin-orbit coupling at\nthe Ru site to address the origin of the suppression of the orbital magnetic\nmoment. The emerging scenario is that of non-local orbital degrees of freedom\nplaying a significant role in the ferromagnetic phase, with the Coulomb\ninteraction that is crucial to make anti-aligned orbital moments at short\ndistance resulting in a ground state with vanishing local orbital moments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2018 12:10:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2019 16:37:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-09"}

For other $C\\neq{0}$ cases,\nthe $\\theta_{RW}$'s are not integral multiples of $\\pi/3$. We find that the RW\ntransition is more sensitive to the deviation of $C$ from one compared to the\nmass non-degeneracy and thus the strength of the traditional RW transition with\n$C=0$ is the strongest. The nature of RW endpoints and its implications to\ndeconfinement transition are investigated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2018 12:34:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Aug 2019 18:19:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-11"}

The\ncentral approximation of the TCR method, the substitution of the interconnect\nwire TCR by the bulk TCR becomes doubtful when the resistivity of the conductor\nmetal is strongly increased by finite size effects. Semiclassical calculations\nfor thin films show that the TCR deviates from bulk values when the surface\nroughness scattering contribution to the total resistivity becomes significant\nwith respect to grain boundary scattering, an effect that might become even\nmore important in nanowires due to their larger surface-to-volume ration. In\naddition, the TCR method is redeveloped to account for line width roughness. It\nis shown that for rough wires, the TCR method yields the harmonic average of\nthe cross-sectional area as well as, to first order, the accurate value of the\nresistivity at the extracted area. Finally, the effect of a conductive barrier\nor liner layer on the TCR method is discussed. It is shown that the liner or\nbarrier parallel conductance can only be neglected when it is lower than about\n5 to 10% of the total conductance.

For $n,q\\in\\mathbb{N}$, the\n$(n,q)$-triangle game is played by two players, called Maker and Breaker, on\nthe complete graph $K_n$. Alternately Maker claims one edge and thereafter\nBreaker claims $q$ edges of the graph. Maker wins the game if he can claim all\nthree edges of a triangle, otherwise Breaker wins. Chv\\'{a}tal and Erd\\H{o}s\n(1978) proved that for $q<\\sqrt{2n+2}-5/2\\approx 1.414\\sqrt{n}$ Maker has a\nwinning strategy, and for $q\\geq 2\\sqrt{n}$ Breaker has a winning strategy.\nSince then, the problem of finding the exact leading constant for the threshold\nbias of the triangle game has been one of the famous open problems in\ncombinatorial game theory.

Although these\nmethods produce sparse representations of signals which are robust against\ndistortions and missing data, such representations quite often turn out to be\nunsuitable if the final objective is signal classification. In order to\novercome or at least to attenuate such a weakness, several new methods which\nincorporate discriminative information into sparse-inducing models have emerged\nin recent years. In particular, methods for discriminative dictionary learning\nhave shown to be more accurate (in terms of signal classification) than the\ntraditional ones, which are only focused on minimizing the total representation\nerror. In this work, we present both a novel multi-class discriminative measure\nand an innovative dictionary learning method. For a given dictionary, this new\nmeasure, which takes into account not only when a particular atom is used for\nrepresenting signals coming from a certain class and the magnitude of its\ncorresponding representation coefficient, but also the effect that such an atom\nhas in the total representation error, is capable of efficiently quantifying\nthe degree of discriminability of each one of the atoms.

Our method was tested with a\nwidely used database for handwritten digit recognition and compared with three\nstate-of-the-art classification methods. The results show that our method\nsignificantly outperforms the other three achieving good recognition rates and\nadditionally, reducing the computational cost of the classifier.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2018 13:02:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-05"}

The SASE 1\nbeamline started its user operation in September 2017, followed by successful\nfirst lasing at the SASE 2 beamline in May 2018. Early user experiments are\nplanned to start in 2019 at this beamline, while early user experiments for the\nSASE 3 beamline are scheduled for the end of 2018. The quality of the\nexperimental data will gain substantial benefits from an accurate\ncharacterization and calibration of the X-ray detectors. Supplementing high\nrepetition rate detectors at MHz speeds, slower detectors such as the ePix100a\nand the FastCCD will be operated at the train repetition rate of 10 Hz. These\n2D silicon pixelized detectors use fast parallel column-wise readout\nimplemented as a CCD or as a hybrid pixel detector. In the following,\ncharacterization and analysis approaches for the FastCCD and the ePix100a\ndetectors are discussed and the performance of the detectors is evaluated using\nappropriate state-of-the-art analysis techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2018 13:06:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2018 16:26:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-30"}

The\nmain challenges lie on significantly varied sizes and aspect ratios, arbitrary\norientations and shapes. Driven by recent progress in deep learning, impressive\nperformances have been achieved for multi-oriented text detection. Yet, the\nperformance drops dramatically in detecting curved texts due to the limited\ntext representation (e.g., horizontal bounding boxes, rotated rectangles, or\nquadrilaterals). It is of great interest to detect curved texts, which are\nactually very common in natural scenes. In this paper, we present a novel text\ndetector named TextField for detecting irregular scene texts. Specifically, we\nlearn a direction field pointing away from the nearest text boundary to each\ntext point. This direction field is represented by an image of two-dimensional\nvectors and learned via a fully convolutional neural network. It encodes both\nbinary text mask and direction information used to separate adjacent text\ninstances, which is challenging for classical segmentation-based approaches.\nBased on the learned direction field, we apply a simple yet effective\nmorphological-based post-processing to achieve the final detection.\nExperimental results show that the proposed TextField outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods by a large margin (28% and 8%) on two curved text\ndatasets: Total-Text and CTW1500, respectively, and also achieves very\ncompetitive performance on multi-oriented datasets: ICDAR 2015 and MSRA-TD500.\nFurthermore, TextField is robust in generalizing to unseen datasets.

The goal of this paper is to synthesize the evidence and\nexperience-based opinions shared on this topic so far in the SE community, and\nto encourage the community to further reflect and act on the research\nrelevance. For this purpose, we have conducted a Multi-vocal Literature Review\n(MLR) of 54 systematically-selected sources (papers and non peer-reviewed\narticles).

The highlights of our\nMLR findings are as follows. The top three root causes of low relevance,\ndiscussed in the community, are: (1) Researchers having simplistic views (or\nwrong assumptions) about SE in practice; (2) Lack of connection with industry;\nand (3) Wrong identification of research problems. The top three suggestions\nfor improving research relevance are: (1) Using appropriate research approaches\nsuch as action-research; (2) Choosing relevant research problems; and (3)\nCollaborating with industry.

The\nrecent successes seen in Learning-based hashing methods are largely due to the\nsuccess of deep learning-based hashing methods. However, there are some\nlimitations to previous learning-based hashing methods (e.g., the learned hash\ncodes containing repetitive and highly correlated information). In this paper,\nwe propose a novel learning-based hashing method, named Deep Attention-guided\nHashing (DAgH). DAgH is implemented using two stream frameworks. The core idea\nis to use guided hash codes which are generated by the hashing network of the\nfirst stream framework (called first hashing network) to guide the training of\nthe hashing network of the second stream framework (called second hashing\nnetwork). Specifically, in the first network, it leverages an attention network\nand hashing network to generate the attention-guided hash codes from the\noriginal images. The loss function we propose contains two components: the\nsemantic loss and the attention loss. The attention loss is used to punish the\nattention network to obtain the salient region from pairs of images; in the\nsecond network, these attention-guided hash codes are used to guide the\ntraining of the second hashing network (i.e., these codes are treated as\nsupervised labels to train the second network). By doing this, DAgH can make\nfull use of the most critical information contained in images to guide the\nsecond hashing network in order to learn efficient hash codes in a true\nend-to-end fashion.

While instrumental variable\n(IV) methods are widely used to identify causal effect, testing their validity\nfrom observed data remains a challenge. This is because validity of an IV\ndepends on two assumptions, exclusion and as-if-random, that are largely\nbelieved to be untestable from data. In this paper, we show that under certain\nconditions, testing for instrumental variables is possible. We build upon prior\nwork on necessary tests to derive a test that characterizes the odds of being a\nvalid instrument, thus yielding the name \"necessary and probably sufficient\".\nThe test works by defining the class of invalid-IV and valid-IV causal models\nas Bayesian generative models and comparing their marginal likelihood based on\nobserved data. When all variables are discrete, we also provide a method to\nefficiently compute these marginal likelihoods.\n  We evaluate the test on an extensive set of simulations for binary data,\ninspired by an open problem for IV testing proposed in past work. We find that\nthe test is most powerful when an instrument follows monotonicity---effect on\ntreatment is either non-decreasing or non-increasing---and has moderate-to-weak\nstrength; incidentally, such instruments are commonly used in observational\nstudies. Among as-if-random and exclusion, it detects exclusion violations with\nhigher power. Applying the test to IVs from two seminal studies on instrumental\nvariables and five recent studies from the American Economic Review shows that\nmany of the instruments may be flawed, at least when all variables are\ndiscretized.

The simplest template used to fit these maps\nconsists in the rotating disk model (RDM) where the amplitude of circular\nvelocities is fixed by the observed velocity profile along the kinematic axis.\nA more sophisticated template is the rotating tilted-ring model (RTRM) that\ntakes into account the presence of warps and allows a radius-dependent\norientation of the kinematic axis. In both cases, axisymmetry is assumed and\nresiduals between the observed and the model velocity fields are interpreted as\nnoncircular motions. We show that if a galaxy is not axisymmetric, there is an\nintrinsic degeneracy between a rotational and a radial velocity field. We then\nintroduce a new galaxy template, the radial ellipse model (REM), that is not\naxisymmetric and has a purely radial velocity field with an amplitude that is\ncorrelated with the major axis of the ellipse. We show that best fits to the\nobserved two-dimensional velocity fields of 28 galaxies extracted from the\nTHINGS sample with both the REM and the RDM give residuals with similar\namplitudes, where the REM residuals trace nonradial motions. Best fits obtained\nwith the RTRM, because of its larger number of free parameters, give the\nsmallest residuals: however, we argue that this does not necessarily imply that\nthe RTRM gives the most accurate representation of a galaxy velocity field.\nInstead, we show that this method is not able to disentangle between circular\nand radial motions for the case of nonaxisymmetric systems. Finally, we\nconsider the physical motivation of the REM, and discuss how the interpretation\nof galactic dynamics changes if one assumes that the main component of a galaxy\nvelocity field is modeled as a RDM/RTRM or as a REM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2018 14:36:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-31"}

Research have shown that this\nis the region which does not get affected much because of various poses, aging,\nexpression, facial changes and other artifacts, which otherwise would change to\na large variation. Active research has been carried out on this topic since\npast few years due to its obvious advantages over face and iris biometrics in\nunconstrained and uncooperative scenarios. Many researchers have explored\nperiocular biometrics involving both visible (VIS) and infra-red (IR) spectrum\nimages.

A 2D Peierls-Nabarro\nfinite element (PN-FE) model for studying edge dislocation transmission across\nfully coherent and non-damaging phase boundaries was recently proposed. This\npaper brings a new dimension to the complexity by extending the PN-FE model\nwith a dedicated cohesive zone model for the phase boundary. With the proposed\nmodel, a natural interplay between dislocations, external boundaries and the\nphase boundary, including decohesion of that boundary, is provided. It allows\none to study the competition between dislocation transmission and phase\nboundary decohesion. Commonly, the interface potentials required for glide\nplane behaviour and phase boundary decohesion are established through atomistic\nsimulations. They are corresponding to the misfit energy intrinsic to a system\nof two bulks of atoms that are translated rigidly with respect to each other.\nIt is shown that the blind utilisation of these potentials in zero-thickness\ninterfaces (as used in the proposed model) may lead to a large quantitative\nerror. Accordingly, for physical consistency, the potentials need to be reduced\ntowards zero-thickness potentials. In this paper a linear elastic reduction is\nadopted. With the reduced potentials for the glide plane and the phase\nboundary, the competition between dislocation transmission and phase boundary\ndecohesion is studied for an 8-dislocation pile-up system. Results reveal a\nstrong influence of the phase contrast in material properties as well as the\nphase boundary toughness on the outcome of this competition. In the case of\ncrack nucleation, the crack length shows an equally strong dependency on these\nproperties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2018 15:07:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-02"}

In particular,\nthe binary pulsar observation of heavy neutron stars requires appropriately\nstiff dense matter in order to counter gravitational collapse, at variance with\nthe predictions of many phenomenological quark models. On the other side, the\nLIGO observations favor a softer EoS therefore providing a lower bound to the\nequation stiffness. We introduce a quantum chromodynamics (QCD) description of\nthe neutron star's high baryon density regime where the pressure and energy\ndensity distributions are directly obtained from the matrix elements of the QCD\nenergy momentum tensor. Recent ab initio calculations allow us to evaluate the\nenergy-momentum tensor in a model independent way including both quark and\ngluon degrees of freedom. Our approach is a first effort to replace quark\nmodels and effective gluon interactions with a first principles, fully\nQCD-based description. Most importantly, the QCD energy momentum tensor matrix\nelements are connected to the Mellin moments of the generalized parton\ndistributions which can be measured in deeply virtual exclusive scattering\nexperiments. As a consequence, we establish a connection between observables\nfrom high energy experiments and from the analysis of gravitational wave\nevents.

Autoregressive image\nmodels have been able to generate small images unconditionally, but the\nextension of these methods to large images where fidelity can be more readily\nassessed has remained an open problem. Among the major challenges are the\ncapacity to encode the vast previous context and the sheer difficulty of\nlearning a distribution that preserves both global semantic coherence and\nexactness of detail. To address the former challenge, we propose the Subscale\nPixel Network (SPN), a conditional decoder architecture that generates an image\nas a sequence of sub-images of equal size. The SPN compactly captures\nimage-wide spatial dependencies and requires a fraction of the memory and the\ncomputation required by other fully autoregressive models. To address the\nlatter challenge, we propose to use Multidimensional Upscaling to grow an image\nin both size and depth via intermediate stages utilising distinct SPNs. We\nevaluate SPNs on the unconditional generation of CelebAHQ of size 256 and of\nImageNet from size 32 to 256.

Firstly, we explore\nthe possibility of existence of equilibrium as well as non-equilibrium picture\nof thermodynamics in this extended version of teleprallel gravity. Here, we\npresent the first law and the generalized second law of thermodynamics (GSLT)\nusing Hubble horizon. It is found that non-equilibrium description of\nthermodynamics exists in this theory with the presence of an extra term called\nas entropy production term. We also establish GSLT using the logarithmic\ncorrected entropy. Further, by taking the equilibrium picture, we discuss\nvalidity of GSLT at Hubble horizon for two $F$ different models. Using Gibbs\nlaw and the assumption that temperature of matter within Hubble horizon is\nsimilar to itself, we use different cases for choices scale factors to discuss\nthe GSLT validity graphically in all scenarios.

Rapid deployment, mobility, higher chances of unobstructed\npropagation path, and flexibility features of UAV-BSs have attracted\nsignificant attention. Despite, potentially, high gains brought by UAV-BSs in\nNGWNs, many challenges are also introduced by them. Optimal location assignment\nto UAV-BSs, arguably, is the most widely investigated problem in the literature\non UAV-BSs in NGWNs. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the\nliterature on the location optimization of UAV-BSs in NGWNs. A generic\noptimization framework through a universal Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programming\n(MINLP) formulation is constructed and the specifications of its constituents\nare elaborated. The generic problem is classified into a novel taxonomy. Due to\nthe highly challenging nature of the optimization problem a range of solutions\nare adopted in the literature which are also covered under the aforementioned\nclassification. Furthermore, future research directions on UAV-BS location\noptimization in 5G and beyond non-terrestrial aerial communication systems are\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Dec 2018 19:22:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-27"}

Rather than transferring large amounts of data across\nthe system interconnect, the Emu Chick moves lightweight thread contexts to\nnear-memory cores before the beginning of each remote memory read. Previous\nwork has characterized the performance of the Chick prototype in terms of\nmemory bandwidth and programming differences from more typical, non-migratory\nplatforms, but there has not yet been an analysis of algorithms on this system.\n  This work evaluates irregular algorithms that could benefit from the\nlightweight, memory-side processing of the Chick and demonstrates techniques\nand optimization strategies for achieving performance in sparse matrix-vector\nmultiply operation (SpMV), breadth-first search (BFS), and graph alignment\nacross up to eight distributed nodes encompassing 64 nodelets in the Chick\nsystem. We also define and justify relative metrics to compare prototype\nFPGA-based hardware with established ASIC architectures. The Chick currently\nsupports up to 68x scaling for graph alignment, 80 MTEPS for BFS on balanced\ngraphs, and 50\\% of measured STREAM bandwidth for SpMV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Dec 2018 16:02:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-10"}

This new scheme is a cluster-based algorithm designed for\nheterogeneous energy wireless sensor networks. A polarized energy factor is\nintroduced to adjust the probability with which each node may become a cluster\nhead in the election of the new clustering scheme. Under the condition that the\nexpected number of cluster heads in the network preserves the theoretical\noptimal number, BECC makes sure that nodes with higher residual energy will\nbecome cluster heads with higher probabilities while nodes with lower residual\nenergy will not become cluster heads. Simulation results show that this new\nscheme provides longer lifetime than the classical clustering algorithms\nincluding LEACH and other improved algorithms in heterogeneous networks, and\nBECC also reaches larger amount of messages received at the sink.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2018 06:59:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-17"}
