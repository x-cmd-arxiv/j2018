However, despite long-standing\ninterest, the evolution of social complexity is still poorly understood. This\nmay be due in part to researchers focusing on the feasibility of quantifying\naspects of sociality, rather than what features are characteristic of animal\nsocial complexity in the first place. Any given approach to studying complexity\ncan tell us some things about animal sociality, but may miss others, so it is\ncritical to decide first how to conceptualize complexity before jumping in to\nquantifying it. Here, we briefly summarize five existing approaches to\nmeasuring social complexity. Then, we highlight three fundamental concepts that\nare commonly used in the field of complex systems: (1) scales of organization,\n(2) compression, and (3) emergence. All of these concepts are applicable to the\nstudy of animal social systems, but are not often explicitly addressed in\nexisting social complexity measures. We discuss how these concepts can provide\na rigorous foundation for conceptualizing social complexity, the potential\nbenefits of incorporating them, and how existing measures do (or do not)\ninclude them. Ultimately, researchers need to critically evaluate any measure\nof animal social complexity in order to balance the biological relevance of the\naspect of sociality they are quantifying with the feasibility of obtaining\nenough data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2018 16:39:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2019 22:20:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-22"}

Achieving this task is shown to typically require proteins to undergo\na conformational change. We argue that physical and evolutionary constraints\nimpel this change to be controlled by a group of sites extending from the\nbinding site. Proteins can thus acquire a latent potential for allosteric\nregulation and evolutionary adaptation because of long-range effects that\ninitially arise as evolutionary spandrels.

We show that theoretically such populations would\nhave the angular power spectrum which is largely independent of the epochs\noccupied by these sources, provided they are at z>~ 4, offering an important\ntest of the origin of the new populations. Using the current measurements we\nreconstruct the underlying soft X-ray CXB from the new sources and show that\nits fluctuations, while consistent with a high-z origin, have an amplitude that\ncannot be reached in direct measurements with the foreseeable X-ray space\nmissions. This necessitates application of the methods developed by the authors\nto future IR and X-ray datasets, which must cover large areas of the sky in\norder to measure the signal with high precision. The LIBRAE project within\nESA's Euclid mission will probe source-subtracted CIB over ~1/2 the sky at\nthree near-IR bands, and its cross-power with unresolved CXB can be measured\nthen from the concurrent eROSITA mission covering the same areas of the sky. We\ndiscuss the required methodology for this measurement and evaluate its\nprojected S/N to show the unique potential of this experimental configuration\nto accurately probe the CXB from the new BH sources and help identify their\nepochs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2018 17:08:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Dec 2018 16:45:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-30"}

In robotics, we\nare recently experiencing an important trend in its usage, at least in the\nfields of estimation, and particularly in motion estimation for navigation.

This work addresses\nboth issues by introducing an approach with some unique features: DIFT for\nmulti-threaded software, virtual memory protection (rather than physical memory\nas in related works) and Linux kernel support using an information flow monitor\ncalled RFBlare. These goals are accomplished by taking advantage of a notable\nfeature of ARM CoreSight components (context ID) combined with a custom DIFT\ncoprocessor and RFBlare. The communication time overhead, major source of\nslowdown in total DIFT time overhead, is divided by a factor 3.8 compared to\nexisting solutions with similar software constraints as in this work.

The intensity ratio of these two features\nvaries widely and several contradictory interpretations have been reported. We\nanalyze the room temperature PL from MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, and WSe2 monolayers and\nshow that these variations arise from differences in the non-radiative\nrecombination associated with defect densities. Hence, the relative intensities\nof the A- and B-emission features can be used to qualitatively asses the\nnon-radiative recombination, and thus the quality of the sample. A low B/A\nratio is indicative of low defect density and high sample quality.

We observe a notably\nhigher valley polarization in the B-exciton relative to the A-exciton.

We\nperform a simple analysis to demonstrate that, with simple signal selection\ncuts, we can close this gap at the LHeC at 95 % confidence level, even in the\npresence of a reasonable systematic error. More sophisticated signal selection\nstrategies and detailed knowledge of the detector can be used to improve the\nprospects of signal detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2018 18:17:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

In particular, the diameter dictates how fast\ninformation can spread throughout data and communication networks. Thus, it is\na natural question to ask how much can we sparsify a graph and still guarantee\nthat its diameter remains preserved within an approximation $t$. This property\nis captured by the notion of extremal-distance spanners. Given a graph\n$G=(V,E)$, a subgraph $H=(V,E_H)$ is defined to be a $t$-diameter spanner if\nthe diameter of $H$ is at most $t$ times the diameter of $G$.\n  We show that for any $n$-vertex and $m$-edges directed graph $G$, we can\ncompute a sparse subgraph $H$ that is a $(1.5)$-diameter spanner of $G$, such\nthat $H$ contains at most $\\tilde O(n^{1.5})$ edges. We also show that the\nstretch factor cannot be improved to $(1.5-\\epsilon)$. For a graph whose\ndiameter is bounded by some constant, we show the existence of\n$\\frac{5}{3}$-diameter spanner that contains at most $\\tilde O(n^\\frac{4}{3})$\nedges. We also show that this bound is tight.\n  Additionally, we present other types of extremal-distance spanners, such as\n$2$-eccentricity spanners and $2$-radius spanners, both contain only $\\tilde\nO(n)$ edges and are computable in $\\tilde O(m)$ time.\n  Finally, we study extremal-distance spanners in the dynamic and\nfault-tolerant settings. An interesting implication of our work is the first\n$\\tilde O(m)$-time algorithm for computing $2$-approximation of vertex\neccentricities in general directed weighted graphs. Backurs et al.

Stark tuning is an\nefficient technique to overcome this issue as it can control the emission\nenergy of individual quantum dots through the quantum-confined Stark effect.\nRealizing this technique in InAs/InP quantum dots has previously been limited\nto shifts of less than 0.8 meV due to jumps in the emission energy because of\nadditional charges at high electric field intensities.

Moreover, the single-photon nature and narrow\nlinewidth of the quantum dot emission is preserved under a wide range of\napplied electric fields. Using photoluminescence intensity measurements and\ntime-resolved lifetime spectroscopy we confirmed that this Stark tuning range\nis limited by carrier tunneling at high electric fields.

We discuss suggestions of a possible A/Q threshold during\nacceleration and of the sluggish ionization of He entering the corona, because\nof its uniquely high first ionization potential (FIP), but the suppression of\nHe and the decline of He/C with energy is difficult to explain if both He and C\nare fully ionized with A/Q = 2 as expected at 2.5 - 3.2 MK. Although less\ndramatic, a possible excess enhancement of Ne in some impulsive SEP events is\nalso considered. Possible causes of the large ~30% spectral and abundance\nvariations in impulsive events are also discussed. However, the physics of the\nHe-poor events remains a mystery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2018 19:15:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Feb 2019 16:08:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-21"}

This idea can be questionable\nbecause this joint distribution may not present when the number of tasks\nincrease. On the other hand, It also leads to \"long-term\" memory issue when the\nnetwork capacity is limited since adding tasks will \"eat\" the network capacity.\nIn this paper, we proposed a Soft Parameters Pruning (SPP) strategy to reach\nthe trade-off between short-term and long-term profit of a learning model by\nfreeing those parameters less contributing to remember former task domain\nknowledge to learn future tasks, and preserving memories about previous tasks\nvia those parameters effectively encoding knowledge about tasks at the same\ntime.

We focus on two problems: searching for scenarios\nwhen learned agents fail and assessing their probability of failure. The\nstandard method for agent evaluation in reinforcement learning, Vanilla Monte\nCarlo, can miss failures entirely, leading to the deployment of unsafe agents.\nWe demonstrate this is an issue for current agents, where even matching the\ncompute used for training is sometimes insufficient for evaluation. To address\nthis shortcoming, we draw upon the rare event probability estimation literature\nand propose an adversarial evaluation approach. Our approach focuses evaluation\non adversarially chosen situations, while still providing unbiased estimates of\nfailure probabilities. The key difficulty is in identifying these adversarial\nsituations -- since failures are rare there is little signal to drive\noptimization. To solve this we propose a continuation approach that learns\nfailure modes in related but less robust agents. Our approach also allows reuse\nof data already collected for training the agent. We demonstrate the efficacy\nof adversarial evaluation on two standard domains: humanoid control and\nsimulated driving.

State-of-the-art collective classification methods for such\ngraph-based security and privacy analytics follow the following paradigm:\nassign weights to edges of the graph, iteratively propagate reputation scores\nof nodes among the weighted graph, and use the final reputation scores to\nclassify nodes in the graph. The key challenge is to assign edge weights such\nthat an edge has a large weight if the two corresponding nodes have the same\nlabel, and a small weight otherwise. Although collective classification has\nbeen studied and applied for security and privacy problems for more than a\ndecade, how to address this challenge is still an open question. In this work,\nwe propose a novel collective classification framework to address this\nlong-standing challenge. We first formulate learning edge weights as an\noptimization problem, which quantifies the goals about the final reputation\nscores that we aim to achieve. However, it is computationally hard to solve the\noptimization problem because the final reputation scores depend on the edge\nweights in a very complex way. To address the computational challenge, we\npropose to jointly learn the edge weights and propagate the reputation scores,\nwhich is essentially an approximate solution to the optimization problem. We\ncompare our framework with state-of-the-art methods for graph-based security\nand privacy analytics using four large-scale real-world datasets from various\napplication scenarios such as Sybil detection in social networks, fake review\ndetection in Yelp, and attribute inference attacks.

It presents streamlined\nproofs of Helfgott's theorems on growth in the $\\mathbf{F}_p$-case, which avoid\nsum-product estimates. For ${{\\rm SL_2}}(\\mathbf{F}_p)$, for sets exceeding in\nsize some absolute constant, we improve the lower bound $\\frac{1}{1512}$ for\nthe growth exponent, due to Kowalski, to $\\frac{1}{21}.$ For the affine group\nwe fetch a sharp theorem of Sz\\H{o}nyi on the number of directions, determined\nby a point set in $\\mathbf{F}_p^2$.\n  We then focus on ${{\\rm Aff}}(\\mathbf{F})$ and present a new incidence bound\nbetween a set of points and a set of lines in $\\mathbf{F}^2$, which explicitly\ndepends on the energy of the set of lines as affine transformations under\ncomposition. This bound, strong when the number of lines is considerably\nsmaller than the number of points, yields generalizations of structural\ntheorems of Elekes and Murphy on rich lines in grids.\n  In the special case when the set of lines is also a grid -- relating back to\nsum-products -- we use growth in ${{\\rm Aff}}(\\mathbf{R})$ to obtain a\nsubthreshold estimate on the energy of the set of lines. This yields a unified\nway to break the ice in various threshold sum-product type energy inequalities.\nWe show this in applications to energy estimates, corresponding to sets $A(A+\nA)$, $A+AA$ (also embracing asymmetric versions) as well as $A+B$ when $A$ has\nsmall multiplicative doubling and $\\sqrt{|A|} \\le |B|\\le|A|^{1+o(1)}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2018 20:36:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 22 Dec 2018 10:52:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 26 Feb 2019 12:26:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-27"}

Consequently, It is imperative to understand the\ndiffusion of such hateful content in an online setting. We conduct the first\nstudy that analyses the flow and dynamics of posts generated by hateful and\nnon-hateful users on Gab (gab.com) over a massive dataset of 341K users and 21M\nposts. Our observations confirms that hateful content diffuse farther, wider\nand faster and have a greater outreach than those of non-hateful users. A\ndeeper inspection into the profiles and network of hateful and non-hateful\nusers reveals that the former are more influential, popular and cohesive. Thus,\nour research explores the interesting facets of diffusion dynamics of hateful\nusers and broadens our understanding of hate speech in the online world.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2018 21:23:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-06"}

We propose here a\nsimple alternative approach to the auto-balanced Ramsey (ABR) interrogation\nprotocol and demonstrate its application to a cold-atom microwave clock based\non coherent population trapping. The main originality of the method, based on\ntwo consecutive Ramsey sequences with different dark periods, is to sample the\ncentral Ramsey fringes with frequency-jumps finely-adjusted by an additional\nfrequency-displacement concomitant parameter, scaling as the inverse of the\ndark-period. The advantage of this displaced frequency-jumps Ramsey (DFJR)\nmethod is that the local oscillator frequency is used as a single physical\nvariable to control both servo loops of the sequence, simplifying its\nimplementation and avoiding noise associated with controlling the LO phase.\nCompared to the usual Ramsey-CPT technique, the DFJR scheme reduces the\nsensitivity of the clock frequency to variations of the CPT sideband ratio and\nto the one-photon laser detuning by more than an order of magnitude. This\nsimple method could be applied in a wide variety of Ramsey-spectroscopy based\napplications including frequency metrology with CPT-based and optical atomic\nclocks, mass spectrometry, and precision spectroscopy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2018 21:44:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

This\nchapter describes an emerging trend in secure data processing that recognizes\nthat an entire dataset may not be sensitive, and hence, non-sensitivity of data\ncan be exploited to overcome some of the limitations of existing\nencryption-based approaches. In particular, data and computation can be\npartitioned into sensitive or non-sensitive datasets - sensitive data can\neither be encrypted prior to outsourcing or stored/processed locally on trusted\nservers. The non-sensitive dataset, on the other hand, can be outsourced and\nprocessed in the cleartext. While partitioned computing can bring new\nefficiencies since it does not incur (expensive) encrypted data processing\ncosts on non-sensitive data, it can lead to information leakage. We study\npartitioned computing in two contexts - first, in the context of the hybrid\ncloud where local resources are integrated with public cloud resources to form\nan effective and secure storage and computational platform for enterprise data.\nIn the hybrid cloud, sensitive data is stored on the private cloud to prevent\nleakage and a computation is partitioned between private and public clouds.\nCare must be taken that the public cloud cannot infer any information about\nsensitive data from inter-cloud data access during query processing. We then\nconsider partitioned computing in a public cloud only setting, where sensitive\ndata is encrypted before outsourcing. We formally define a partitioned security\ncriterion that any approach to partitioned computing on public clouds must\nensure in order to not introduce any new vulnerabilities to the existing secure\nsolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2018 23:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-06"}

Recently, the notion of differential privacy (DP) has been\napplied to privacy preservation for collaborative filtering recommendation\nalgorithms. However, as far as we know, existing differentially private CF\nrecommendation schemes degraded the recommendation performance (such as recall\nand precision) to an unacceptable level. In this paper, in order to address the\nperformance degradation problem, we propose a differentially private user-based\ncollaborative filtering recommendation scheme based on k-means clustering\n(KDPCF). Specifically, to improve the recommendation performance, we first\ncluster the dataset into categories by k-means clustering and appropriately\nadjust the size of the target category to which the target user belongs, so\nthat only users in the well-sized target category can be used for\nrecommendations. Then we efficiently select a set of neighbors from the target\ncategory at one time by employing only one exponential mechanism instead of the\ncomposition of multiple ones, and base on the neighbor set to recommend. We\ntheoretically prove that our scheme achieves differential privacy. Empirically,\nwe use the MovieLens dataset to evaluate our recommendation system.

Designing DNNs that can meet a stringent energy budget is becoming\nincreasingly important. This paper proposes ECC, a framework that compresses\nDNNs to meet a given energy constraint while minimizing accuracy loss. The key\nidea of ECC is to model the DNN energy consumption via a novel bilinear\nregression function. The energy estimate model allows us to formulate DNN\ncompression as a constrained optimization that minimizes the DNN loss function\nover the energy constraint. The optimization problem, however, has nontrivial\nconstraints. Therefore, existing deep learning solvers do not apply directly.\nWe propose an optimization algorithm that combines the essence of the\nAlternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) framework with\ngradient-based learning algorithms. The algorithm decomposes the original\nconstrained optimization into several subproblems that are solved iteratively\nand efficiently. ECC is also portable across different hardware platforms\nwithout requiring hardware knowledge. Experiments show that ECC achieves higher\naccuracy under the same or lower energy budget compared to state-of-the-art\nresource-constrained DNN compression techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2018 03:31:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2018 14:49:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 6 Apr 2019 04:46:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-09"}

Our framework allows sampling to be performed\nat the beginning of a sequence of multiple transformations ending in an\naggregation operation. The framework constructs a data provenance tree as the\ncomputation proceeds, then combines the tree with multi-stage sampling and\npopulation estimation theories to compute error bounds for the aggregation.\nWhen information about output keys are available early, the framework can also\nuse adaptive stratified reservoir sampling to avoid (or reduce) key losses in\nthe final output and to achieve more consistent error bounds across popular and\nrare keys. Finally, the framework includes an algorithm to dynamically choose\nsampling rates to meet user specified constraints on the CDF of error bounds in\nthe outputs. We have implemented a prototype of our framework called\nApproxSpark, and used it to implement five approximate applications from\ndifferent domains. Evaluation results show that ApproxSpark can (a)\nsignificantly reduce execution time if users can tolerate small amounts of\nuncertainties and, in many cases, loss of rare keys, and (b) automatically find\nsampling rates to meet user specified constraints on error bounds.

Our large-scale analysis confirms that VMs are often misconfigured,\neither overprovisioned or underprovisioned, and that this problem is pervasive\nacross a wide range of private clusters.

Our primary contribution\nis a MaxSAT-based framework, called MLIC, which allows principled search for\ninterpretable classification rules expressible in propositional logic. Our\napproach benefits from the revolutionary advances in the constraint\nsatisfaction community to solve large-scale instances of such problems. In\nexperimental evaluations over a collection of benchmarks arising from practical\nscenarios, we demonstrate its effectiveness: we show that the formulation can\nsolve large classification problems with tens or hundreds of thousands of\nexamples and thousands of features, and to provide a tunable balance of\naccuracy vs. interpretability. Furthermore, we show that in many problems\ninterpretability can be obtained at only a minor cost in accuracy. The primary\nobjective of the paper is to show that recent advances in the MaxSAT literature\nmake it realistic to find optimal (or very high quality near-optimal) solutions\nto large-scale classification problems. The key goal of the paper is to excite\nresearchers in both interpretable classification and in the CP community to\ntake it further and propose richer formulations, and to develop bespoke solvers\nattuned to the problem of interpretable ML.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2018 07:40:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-06"}

Traditional\ntools like NetFlow face great challenges when both the speed and the complexity\nof the network traffic increase. To keep pace up, we propose HashFlow, a tool\nfor more efficient and accurate collection and analysis of flow records. The\ncentral idea of HashFlow is to maintain accurate records for elephant flows,\nbut summarized records for mice flows, by applying a novel collision resolution\nand record promotion strategy to hash tables. The performance bound can be\nanalyzed with a probabilistic model, and with this strategy, HashFlow achieves\na better utilization of space, and also more accurate flow records, without\nbringing extra complexity. We have implemented HashFlow, as well as several\nlatest flow measurement algorithms such as FlowRadar, HashPipe and\nElasticSketch, in a P4 software switch. Then we use traces from different\noperational networks to evaluate them. In these experiments, for various types\nof traffic analysis applications, HashFlow consistently demonstrates a clearly\nbetter performance against its state-of-the-art competitors. For example, using\na small memory of 1 MB, HashFlow can accurately record around 55K flows, which\nis often 12.5% higher than the others. For estimating the sizes of 50K flows,\nHashFlow achieves a relative error of around 11.6%, while the estimation error\nof the best competitor is 42.9% higher. It detects 96.1% of the heavy hitters\nout of 250K flows with a size estimation error of 5.6%, which is 11.3% and\n73.7% better than the best competitor respectively. At last, we show these\nmerits of HashFlow come with almost no degradation of throughput.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2018 07:48:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-06"}

Recent studies,\nhowever, have shown that even slow wind can be sometimes highly Alfv\\'enic with\nfluctuations as large as those of the fast wind. The present study is devoted\nto present many facets of this Alfv\\'enic slow solar wind including for example\nthe study of the source regions and their connection to coronal structures,\nlarge-scale properties and micro-scale phenomena and also impact on the\nspectral features. This study will be conducted performing a comparative\nanalysis with the typical slow wind and with the fast wind. It has been found\nthat the fast wind and the Alfv\\'enic slow wind share common characteristics,\nprobably attributable to their similar solar origin, i.e. coronal-hole solar\nwind. Given these similarities, it is suggested that in the Alfv\\'enic slow\nwind a major role is played by the super-radial expansion responsible for the\nlower velocity.

This\ngives an average overall sound pressure level (OSPL) reduction of 1.5 -- 2 dB\nfor the flaplets affixed to the pressure side. The cases where the tonal noise\ncomponent is removed an OSPL reduction of up to 20 dB can be seen.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2018 11:12:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

We\nthen study the formation and evolution of PBH binaries before recombination by\nperforming N-body simulations. We find that the analytical estimate based on\nthe tidally perturbed 2-body system strongly overestimates the present merger\nrate when PBHs comprise all dark matter, as most initial binaries are disrupted\nby the surrounding PBHs.

Recent interests in low-latency applications have\nmotivated the usage of shorter OFDM symbols where one can either downscale the\nCP at the cost of interference, or maintain it but with larger overhead.\nAlternatively, this paper studies channel shortening methods exploiting the\nproperties of large multi-antenna precoding in order to steer the transmitted\nsignal energy toward channel paths inside an insufficient CP. It is shown that\nISI/ICI can asymptotically be canceled by conventional subcarrier-based\nprecoding with an infinite number of antennas. This is achieved by introducing\ntime-delay selectivity inside frequency-selective precoders in order to remove\nundesired delayed signals, providing a trade-off between interference\nmitigation and multi-path combining gains, and leading to subsequent gains in\nhigh SNR. This frequency-domain precoding method, coined time-frequency (TF)\nprecoding, is compared to time-reversal (TR) filtering whose asymptotic rate is\noptimal but introduces post-modulation processing with channel-dependent signal\ndistortion. In addition to maintain the legacy precoded multi-antenna OFDM\nstructure, finite-size analysis shows that TF-precoding converges faster to its\nasymptotic rate than TR-filtering, so that TF-precoding can outperform\nTRfiltering in the high-SNR regime with not-so-many antennas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2018 12:11:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 May 2019 14:33:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2020 09:17:15 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 11 Feb 2021 10:30:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-12"}

Evolution of electric field and so power\ncoupling processes are calculated using Finite Element Method (FEM). Unlike\nPIC/MCC or hybrid fluid, here FEM model uses time dependent Poisson solver\nthrough drift-diffusion approach. In presence of plasma gradient in the volume\nambipolar electric field is generated which interacts with the MW electric\nfield to form resultant total electric field which continuously vary during\nthis evolution period. It is observed that main power coupling mechanism is\nelectron cyclotron resonance (ECR) method, however with the evolution of\nplasma, the mode shifts from ECR to off-ECR type heating with time. Off-ECR\nheating in the form of upper-hybrid resonance (UHR) method, electro-static (ES)\nion acoustic wave heating method are important heating mechanisms during the\nover-dense plasma condition, when density is above critical density for\nlaunched MW frequency, 2.45 GHz.

As expected, we see a presence of localized icosahedral ordering\nin the disordered initial state (packing fraction around 0.62). As the\nfrequency is increased for both the shaking amplitudes (0.2 and 0.6 mm) studied\nhere, there is a rise in packing fraction, accompanied by an evolution to\ncrystallinity. The extent of crystallinity is found to depend on both the\namplitude and frequency of shaking.

In the ordered state, crystalline clusters of both face centered\ncubic (FCC) and hexagonal close packed (HCP) types are identified, the latter\nof which grows from stacking faults.

Moreover, we describe the effect of considering\nadditional internal states with SU(N) symmetry, which ultimately leads to the\nvanishing of spin excitations in a completely balanced system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2018 13:13:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Jan 2020 15:06:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-13"}

Efforts to acquire more precise TOAs given fixed effective area\nof telescopes, finite receiver noise, and limited integration time have led\npulsar astronomers to the solution of implementing ultra-wideband receivers.\nThis solution, however, has run up against the problem that pulse profile\nshapes evolve with frequency, which raises the question of how to properly\nmeasure and analyze TOAs obtained using template-matching methods. This paper\nproposes a new method for one facet of this problem, that of template profile\ngeneration, and demonstrates it on the well-timed millisecond pulsar\nJ1713+0747. Specifically, we decompose pulse profile evolution into a linear\ncombination of basis eigenvectors, the coefficients of which change slowly with\nfrequency such that their evolution is modeled simply by a sum of low degree\npiecewise polynomial spline functions.

The use of wideband TOAs is becoming important for pulsar timing array\nexperiments, as the volume of datasets comprised of conventional, subbanded\nTOAs are quickly becoming unwieldly for the Bayesian analyses needed to uncover\nlatent gravitational wave signals. Although motivated by high precision timing\nexperiments, our technique is applicable in more general pulsar observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2018 13:54:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-30"}

Studying the spots of late-type stars is crucial for distinguishing\nbetween the various proposed dynamo mechanisms believed to be the main cause of\nstarspot activity. For this research it is important to collect observation\ntime series that are long enough to unravel both long- and short-term spot\nevolution. Doppler imaging is a very efficient method for studying spots of\nstars that cannot be angularly resolved. Aims. High-resolution spectral\nobservations during 1994-2017 are analysed in order to reveal long- and\nshort-term changes in the spot activity of the FK Comae-type subgiant HD\n199178. Methods. Most of the observations were collected with the Nordic\nOptical Telescope. The Doppler imaging temperature maps were calculated using\nan inversion technique based on Tikhonov regularisation and utilising multiple\nspectral lines. Results. We present a unique series of 41 temperature maps\nspanning more than 23 years. All reliable images show a large cool spot region\ncentred near the visible rotation pole. Some lower latitude cool features are\nalso recovered, although the reliability of these is questionable. There is an\nexpected anti-correlation between the mean surface temperature and the spot\ncoverage. Using the Doppler images, we construct the equivalent of a solar\nbutterfly diagram for HD 199178. Conclusions. HD 199178 clearly has a long-term\nlarge and cool spot structure at the rotational pole. This spot structure\ndominated the spot activity during the years 1994-2017. The size and position\nof the structure has evolved with time, with a gradual increase during the last\nyears. The lack of lower latitude features prevents the determination of a\npossible differential rotation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2018 14:28:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Jun 2019 11:26:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-10"}

In\nthis emerging research area, one key direction is to efficiently utilize radio\nresources for wireless data acquisition to minimize the latency of executing a\nlearning task at an edge server. Along this direction, we consider the specific\nproblem of retransmission decision in each communication round to ensure both\nreliability and quantity of those training data for accelerating model\nconvergence. To solve the problem, a new retransmission protocol called\ndata-importance aware automatic-repeat-request (importance ARQ) is proposed.\nUnlike the classic ARQ focusing merely on reliability, importance ARQ\nselectively retransmits a data sample based on its uncertainty which helps\nlearning and can be measured using the model under training. Underpinning the\nproposed protocol is a derived elegant communication-learning relation between\ntwo corresponding metrics, i.e., signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and data\nuncertainty. This relation facilitates the design of a simple threshold based\npolicy for importance ARQ. The policy is first derived based on the classic\nclassifier model of support vector machine (SVM), where the uncertainty of a\ndata sample is measured by its distance to the decision boundary. The policy is\nthen extended to the more complex model of convolutional neural networks (CNN)\nwhere data uncertainty is measured by entropy. Extensive experiments have been\nconducted for both the SVM and CNN using real datasets with balanced and\nimbalanced distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that importance ARQ\neffectively copes with channel fading and noise in wireless data acquisition to\nachieve faster model convergence than the conventional channel-aware ARQ.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2018 15:05:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2019 15:06:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-20"}

However, most successful DNNs have an extremely complex\nstructure, leading to extensive research on model compression.As a significant\narea of progress in model compression, traditional gradual pruning approaches\ninvolve an iterative prune-retrain procedure and may suffer from two critical\nissues: local importance judgment, where the pruned weights are merely\nunimportant in the current model; and an irretrievable pruning process, where\nthe pruned weights have no chance to come back. Addressing these two issues,\nthis paper proposes the Drop Pruning approach, which leverages stochastic\noptimization in the pruning process by introducing a drop strategy at each\npruning step, namely, drop away, which stochastically deletes some unimportant\nweights, and drop back, which stochastically recovers some pruned weights. The\nsuitable choice of drop probabilities decreases the model size during the\npruning process and helps it flow to the target sparsity. Compared to the\nBayesian approaches that stochastically train a compact model for pruning, we\ndirectly aim at stochastic gradual pruning. We provide a detailed analysis\nshowing that the drop away and drop back approaches have individual\ncontributions. Moreover, Drop Pruning can achieve competitive compression\nperformance and accuracy on many benchmark tasks compared with state-of-the-art\nweights pruning and Bayesian training approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2018 15:19:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Apr 2020 01:44:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-13"}

A\nclassical result of Tutte(1954) is the polynomial time algorithm to check\nwhether a given graph has a specified f-factor. However, checking for the\npresence of a connected f-factor is easily seen to generalize HAMILTONIAN CYCLE\nand hence is NP-complete. In fact, the CONNECTED f-FACTOR problem remains\nNP-complete even when we restrict f(v) to be at least n^e for each vertex v and\n0<e<1; on the other side of the spectrum of nontrivial lower bounds on f, the\nproblem is known to be polynomial time solvable when f(v) is at least n/3 for\nevery vertex v.

Instead of enforcing each SAP to sense the entire spectrum,\nwe develop a sensing assignment scheduler that ensures each one senses a subset\nof the spectrum.

Therefore, it is\nhigh time to think about a more secure and flexible question sharing system\nwhich can prevent QPL issue in the future education system. Blockchain enables\na way of creating and storing transactions, contracts or anything that requires\nprotection against tampering, accessing etc. This paper presents a new scheme\nfor smart education, by utilizing the concept of blockchain, for question\nsharing. A two-phase encryption technique for encrypting question paper (QSP)\nis proposed. In the first phase, QSPs are encrypted using timestamp and in the\nsecond phase, previous encrypted QSPs are encrypted again using a timestamp,\nsalt hash and hashes from previous QSPs. These encrypted QSPs are stored in the\nblockchain along with a smart contract which helps the user to unlock the\nselected QSP. An algorithm is also proposed for selecting a QSP for the exam\nwhich picks a QSP randomly. Moreover, a timestamp based lock is imposed on the\nscheme so that no one can decrypt the QSP before the allowed time. Finally,\nsecurity is analyzed by proving different propositions and the superiority of\nthe proposed scheme over existing schemes is proven through a comparative study\nbased on the different features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2018 00:28:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-11"}
