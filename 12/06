To this end, we introduce a\nrange of equations of state that vary the nucleon effective mass,\nincompressibility, symmetry energy, and nuclear saturation point. This allows\nus to point to the different effects in changing these properties from the\nLattimer and Swesty to the Shen et al. equations of state, the two most\ncommonly used equations of state in simulations. In particular, we trace the\ncontraction behavior to the effective mass, which determines the thermal\nnucleonic contributions to the equation of state. Larger effective masses lead\nto lower pressures at nuclear densities and a lower thermal index. This results\nin a more rapid contraction of the proto-neutron star and consequently higher\nneutrino energies, which aids the shock evolution to a faster explosion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2018 17:14:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2020 08:02:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-13"}

The disk instability model\n(DIM) assumes that accretion is driven by turbulent transport, customarily\nattributed to the magneto-rotational instability (MRI). Recent results point\nout that MRI turbulence alone fails to reproduce the light curves of DNe. We\naim to study the impact of wind-driven accretion on the light curves of DNe.\nLocal and global simulations show that magneto-hydrodynamic winds are present\nwhen a magnetic field threads the disk, even for relatively high ratios of\nthermal pressure to magnetic pressure ($\\beta \\approx 10^{5}$). These winds are\nvery efficient in removing angular momentum but do not heat the disk; they do\nnot behave as MRI-driven turbulence. We add wind-driven transport in the\nangular momentum equation of the DIM, assuming a fixed magnetic configuration:\ndipolar or constant with radius. We use prescriptions for the wind torque and\nthe turbulent torque derived from shearing box simulations. The wind torque\nenhances the accretion of matter, resulting in light curves that look like DNe\noutbursts when assuming a dipolar field with a moment\n$\\mu\\approx10^{30}\\,\\mathrm{G\\,cm^{3}}$. In the region where the wind\ndominates, the disk is cold, optically thin and the accretion speed is sonic.\nThis acts as if the inner disk was truncated, leading to higher quiescent X-ray\nluminosities from the white dwarf boundary layer than expected with the\nstandard DIM. The disk is stabilized if the wind-dominated region is large\nenough, potentially leading to `dark' disks emitting little radiation.\nWind-driven accretion can play a key role in shaping the light curves of DNe\nand X-ray binaries. Future studies will need to include the time evolution of\nthe magnetic field threading the disk to fully assess its impact on the\ndynamics of the accretion flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2018 16:14:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 May 2019 11:43:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-10"}

Traditional model reduction methods have difficulties with\nthese transport-dominated problems because propagating coherent structures\ntypically introduce high-dimensional features that require high-dimensional\napproximation spaces. The approach proposed in this work exploits the locality\nin space and time of propagating coherent structures to derive efficient\nreduced models. Full-model solutions are approximated locally in time via local\nreduced spaces that are adapted with basis updates during time stepping. The\nbasis updates are derived from querying the full model at a few selected\nspatial coordinates. A core contribution of this work is an adaptive sampling\nscheme for selecting at which components to query the full model to compute\nbasis updates. The presented analysis shows that, in probability, the more\nlocal the coherent structure is in space, the fewer full-model samples are\nrequired to adapt the reduced basis with the proposed adaptive sampling scheme.\nNumerical results on benchmark examples with interacting wave-type structures\nand time-varying transport speeds and on a model combustor of a single-element\nrocket engine demonstrate the wide applicability of the proposed approach and\nruntime speedups of up to one order of magnitude compared to full models and\ntraditional reduced models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2018 16:36:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 14 Jun 2020 14:35:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-16"}

Missing such\nconstraints may lead to unexpected mismatches, expensive resolution, and\nrunning-late projects. However, it is a challenging task for software\narchitects and analysts to manually analyze the unstructured text in API\ndocuments to identify the COINs.

In this article,\nwe present and evaluate our idea of utilizing machine learning techniques in\nautomating the COIN identification, which is the first step of conceptual\ninteroperability analysis, from human text in API documents.

After formalizing the expected effect of a foreground mask on the\nmeasured galaxy density, under a linear, luminosity-dependent bias model for\ngalaxies, we construct two estimators that single out the mask contribution if\na sufficient number of independent redshift bins is available. These estimators\nare combined to give a reconstruction of the mask. We use Milky-Way reddening\nas a prototype for the mask. Using a set of 20 large mock catalogs covering\n$1/4$-th of the sky and number-matched to $H\\alpha$ emitters to mimic an\nEuclid-like sample, we demonstrate that our method can reconstruct the mask and\nits angular clustering at scales $\\ell<100$, beyond which the cosmological\nsignal becomes dominant. The uncertainty of this reconstruction is quantified\nto be $1/3$-rd of the sample variance of the signal. Such a reconstruction\nrequires knowledge of the average and square average of the mask, but we show\nthat it is possible to recover this information either from external models or\ninternally from the data. It also relies on knowledge of how the impact of the\nforeground changes with redshift (due to the extinction curve in our case), but\nthis can be tightly constrained by cross correlations of different redshift\nbins. The strong points of this blind reconstruction technique lies in the\nability to find \"unknown unknowns\" that affect a survey, and in the facility to\nquantify, using sets of mock catalogs, how its uncertainty propagates to\nclustering measurements.

To overcome this problem we estimate the\nmortality rate function from field data on the abundance of the species.

Moreover, the variability in the estimate is\nquantified by means of the confidence bands for both mortality and dynamics.\nThe presented method allows to obtain a more flexible shape for the mortality\nrate functions compared with previous methods applied to the same pest.

Assuming an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) noise\nmodel, minimizing the expected mean square error (MMSE) leads to the known\nA-optimality criterion for graph sampling, which is expensive to compute and\ndifficult to optimize. In this paper, we propose an augmented objective based\non Neumann series that well approximates the original criterion and is amenable\nto greedy optimization. Specifically, we show that a shifted A-optimal\ncriterion can be equivalently written as a function of an ideal low-pass (LP)\ngraph filter, which in turn can be approximated efficiently via fast graph\nFourier transform (FGFT). Minimizing the new objective, we select nodes\ngreedily without large matrix inversions using a matrix inverse lemma. Further,\nfor the dynamic network case where node availability varies across time, we\npropose an extended sampling strategy that replaces offline samples one-by-one\nin the selected set. For signal reconstruction, we propose an accompanied\nbiased signal recovery strategy that reuses the approximated filter from\nsampling. Experiments show that our reconstruction is more robust to large\nnoise than the least square (LS) solution, and our sampling strategy far\noutperforms several existing schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2018 16:58:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-23"}

For a 2D line segment map, our dual\nrepresentation consists of three components: (i) A region-partition map in\nwhich every pixel is assigned to one and only one line segment; (ii) An\nattraction field map in which every pixel in a partition region is encoded by\nits 2D projection vector w.r.t. the associated line segment; and (iii) A\nsqueeze module which squashes the attraction field to a line segment map that\nalmost perfectly recovers the input one.

Over TiO$_{2}$\nand SnO$_{2}$, the conductivity was low in the dark, increased with light\nintensity, and persisted for 10's of seconds after the light was removed. At\nelevated temperature over TiO$_{2}$, the rate of conductivity recovery in the\ndark showed an activated temperature dependence (E$_{a}$ = 0.58 eV).\nSurprisingly, the light-induced conductivity over TiO$_{2}$ and SnO$_{2}$\nrelaxed essentially instantaneously at low temperature.

In particular, our system divides an AI model into\nmultiple pieces and deploys them among multiple cloud vendors who then\ncollaboratively execute the APIs. Our design ensures that cloud vendors cannot\ncollude with each other to steal the combined model, while individual cloud\nvendors and clients cannot repudiate their input or model executions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2018 18:45:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-06"}

While Arnold's framework relies on the deterministic concept\nof Lagrangian flow, Brenier's least-action principle describes solutions to the\nEuler equations in terms of non-deterministic \"generalised flows\", namely\nprobability measures over sets of Lagrangian trajectories. Generalised flows\nseem naturally fit to describe turbulent Lagrangian trajectories in terms of\nstochastic processes, an approach that originates from Richardson's seminal\nwork on turbulent dispersion. In particular, they seem suited to address cases\nwhen the concept of Lagrangian flow breaks down, due to Lagrangian trajectories\nbecoming spontaneously stochastic. The purpose of the present paper is\ntherefore to give a physical perspective on Brenier's principle, and provide a\nqualitative description of the hydrodynamical features of generalised flows.\nUsing Monte-Carlo techniques, we analyse the statistical features of three\nclasses of two-dimensional generalised flows, ranging from solid rotation and\ncellular flows to to freely decaying two-dimensional turbulence.

Introduction of Gaussian quadratures suggests more\ndirect approaches. The real, positive, and continuous weight function, rho(x),\nis constructed directly from interpolation of the zeros, x[k], and weights,\nw[k], of the polynomials orthogonal for that measure. This novel numerical\napproach rests on a simple theorem: namely, rho(x[k]), evaluated at the\nquadrature point x[k], is approximated by w[k]/(dx[k]/dk), with k now being\nassumed to be a continuous real variable. This derivative rule is shown to be\nclosely related to a simple type of universal behavior, relating the clock-rule\nspacings of the x[k] to the derivatives dx[k]/dk which, once established,\nallows an immediate derivation of the derivative rule, via known and well\nunderstood clock-rule results for Nevai-Blumenthal class polynomials. This\nframework also leads to a statement of a universality for quadrature weights\nand weight functions. This is implicit in statements of clock-rule universality\nfor the N-B class, but not made explicit. This new universality is illustrated\nfor several classical orthogonal polynomials, and the non-classical Pollaczek\npolynomials. The derivative rule is then applied to the problem of numerical\nStieltjes inversion, for both finite and unbounded intervals giving exponential\nconvergence.

While the LSST Wide-Fast-Deep survey and accompanying Deep\nDrilling and mini-surveys will be ground-breaking for each of these areas,\nthere remain competing demands on the survey area, depth, and temporal coverage\namid a desire to maximize all three. In this white paper, we seek to address a\nprincipal source of tension between the different LSST science collaborations,\nthat of the survey area and depth that they each need in the parts of the sky\nthat they care about. We present simple tools which can be used to explore\ntrades between the area surveyed by LSST and the number of visits available per\nfield and then use these tools to propose a change to the baseline survey\nstrategy. Specifically, we propose to reconfigure the WFD footprint to consist\nof low-extinction regions (limited by galactic latitude), with the number of\nvisits per field in WFD limited by the LSST Science Requirements Document (SRD)\ndesign goal, and suggest assignment of the remaining LSST visits to the full\nvisible LSST sky. This proposal addresses concerns with the WFD footprint\nraised by the DESC (as 25 percent of the current baseline WFD region is not\nusable for dark energy science due to MW dust extinction), eases the time\nrequired for the NES and SCP mini-surveys (since in our proposal they would\npartially fall into the modified WFD footprint), raises the number of visits\npreviously assigned to the GP region, and increases the overlap with DESI and\nother Northern hemisphere follow-up facilities. This proposal alleviates many\nof the current concerns of Science Collaborations that represent the four\nscientific pillars of LSST and provides a Big Sky approach to cadence\ndiplomacy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2018 19:55:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-07"}

This paper provides a\ncomprehensive approach for investigating the effects of hyperparameter tuning\non three Decision Tree induction algorithms, CART, C4.5 and CTree.

One would never want another analyst to\nrepeat a calculation with the same dataset, using a seemingly identical\nprocedure, only to find a different conclusion. However, as we show in this\nwork, there is a typical source of uncertainty that is essentially never\nconsidered in observational causal studies: the choice of match assignment for\nmatched groups, that is, which unit is matched to which other unit before a\nhypothesis test is conducted. The choice of match assignment is anything but\ninnocuous, and can have a surprisingly large influence on the causal\nconclusions. Given that a vast number of causal inference studies test\nhypotheses on treatment effects after treatment cases are matched with similar\ncontrol cases, we should find a way to quantify how much this extra source of\nuncertainty impacts results.

Widespread understandings are based on the molecular orbital theory and\nfocused on the degree of filling of antibonding surface-adsorbate states that\nweaken bonding on surfaces. The unoccupied antibonding surface-adsorbate states\nare often tacitly assumed to be irrelevant. Here, we show that most antibonding\nstates become unoccupied because the electrons that would occupy these\nantibonding states are transferred to the lower-energy Fermi level. Such\nantibonding electron transfer goes beyond molecular orbital theory. It leads to\nan energy gain that largely controls the trends of surface adsorption strength\nand can serve as a primary descriptor for bonding on surfaces. This finding is\nillustrated from the first-principles study of hydrogen adsorption on MoS$_2$\nsurfaces. A clear linear relationship between the energies of antibonding\nelectron transfer and hydrogen adsorption is identified. The hydrogen evolution\nreaction on MoS$_2$ is found to originate from the in-gap states induced by\nsulfur vacancies or edges. The effects of surface inhomogeneity (e.g., defects,\nstep edges) on surface catalysis can be understood from the corresponding\ndifferent energies gained from antibonding electron transfer. The emerging\npicture also offers a physically different explanation for the well-known\n$d$-band theory for hydrogen adsorption on transition metal surfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2018 21:18:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-02"}

The disentangled representation learning approach posits that such an\nagent would benefit from separating out (disentangling) the underlying\nstructure of the world into disjoint parts of its representation. However,\nthere is no generally agreed-upon definition of disentangling, not least\nbecause it is unclear how to formalise the notion of world structure beyond toy\ndatasets with a known ground truth generative process. Here we propose that a\nprincipled solution to characterising disentangled representations can be found\nby focusing on the transformation properties of the world. In particular, we\nsuggest that those transformations that change only some properties of the\nunderlying world state, while leaving all other properties invariant, are what\ngives exploitable structure to any kind of data. Similar ideas have already\nbeen successfully applied in physics, where the study of symmetry\ntransformations has revolutionised the understanding of the world structure. By\nconnecting symmetry transformations to vector representations using the\nformalism of group and representation theory we arrive at the first formal\ndefinition of disentangled representations. Our new definition is in agreement\nwith many of the current intuitions about disentangling, while also providing\nprincipled resolutions to a number of previous points of contention. While this\nwork focuses on formally defining disentangling - as opposed to solving the\nlearning problem - we believe that the shift in perspective to studying data\ntransformations can stimulate the development of better representation learning\nalgorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2018 21:21:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-07"}

Instead of resolving all scales of motion, which is\ncurrently mathematically and numerically intractable, reduced models that\ncapture the large-scale behavior are derived. One of the most popular reduced\nmodels is the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations. The goal is to\nsolve the RANS equations for the mean velocity and pressure field. However, the\nRANS equations contain a term called the Reynolds stress tensor, which is not\nknown in terms of the mean velocity field. Many RANS turbulence models have\nbeen proposed to model the Reynolds stress tensor in terms of the mean velocity\nfield, but are usually not suitably general for all flow fields of interest.\nData-driven turbulence models have recently garnered considerable attention and\nhave been rapidly developed. In a seminal work, Ling et al (2016) developed the\ntensor basis neural network (TBNN), which was used to learn a general Galilean\ninvariant model for the Reynolds stress tensor.

Here we use nebulae from the WISE Catalog of\nGalactic HII Regions to define the Galactic high-mass star formation (HMSF)\nmidplane. We analyze various subsamples of the WISE catalog and find that all\nhave Galactic latitude scale heights near 0.30deg. and z-distribution scale\nheights near 30pc. The vertical distribution for small (presumably young) HII\nregions is narrower than that of larger (presumably old) HII regions (~25pc\nversus ~40pc), implying that the larger regions have migrated further from\ntheir birth sites. For all HII region subsamples and for a variety of fitting\nmethodologies, we find that the HMSF midplane is not significantly tilted or\nrolled with respect to the currently-defined midplane, and therefore the Sun is\nnear to the HMSF midplane. These results are consistent with other studies of\nHMSF, but are inconsistent with many stellar studies, perhaps due to\nasymmetries in the stellar distribution near the Sun.

However, supercooled water exhibits fascinating and complex\ndynamical behavior, most notably dynamical heterogeneity (DH), a phenomenon\nwhere spatially separated domains of relatively mobile and immobile particles\ncoexist. Strikingly, the microscopic connection between the DH of water and the\nnucleation of ice has yet to be unraveled directly at the molecular level. Here\nwe tackle this issue via computer simulations which reveal that: (i) ice\nnucleation occurs in low-mobility regions of the liquid; (ii) there is a\ndynamical incubation period in which the mobility of the molecules drops prior\nto any ice-like ordering; and (iii) ice-like clusters cause arrested dynamics\nin surrounding water molecules.

With the development of deep neural networks (DNNs), combining\ntechniques from DNNs with clustering has become a new research direction and\nachieved some success. However, few studies have focused on the imbalanced-data\nproblem which commonly occurs in real-world applications. In this paper, we\npropose a clustering method, regularized deep embedding clustering (RDEC), that\nintegrates virtual adversarial training (VAT), a network regularization\ntechnique, with a clustering method called deep embedding clustering (DEC). DEC\noptimizes cluster assignments by pushing data more densely around centroids in\nlatent space, but it is sometimes sensitive to the initial location of\ncentroids, especially in the case of imbalanced data, where the minor class has\nless chance to be assigned a good centroid. RDEC introduces regularization\nusing VAT to ensure the model's robustness to local perturbations of data. VAT\npushes data that are similar in the original space closer together in the\nlatent space, bunching together data from minor classes and thereby\nfacilitating cluster identification by RDEC. Combining the advantages of DEC\nand VAT, RDEC attains state-of-the-art performance on both balanced and\nimbalanced benchmark/real-world datasets. For example, accuracies are as high\nas 98.41% on MNIST dataset and 85.45% on a highly imbalanced dataset derived\nfrom the MNIST, which is nearly 8% higher than the current best result.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Dec 2018 02:09:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-07"}

It can feel like\na mystery: intangible, inexplicable, and beyond the reach of science. However,\nscience is making exciting headway into understanding creativity. While the\nmind of a highly uncreative individual consists of a collection of items\naccumulated through direct experience and enculturation, the mind of a creative\nindividual is self-organizing and self-mending; thus, experiences and items of\ncultural knowledge are thought through from different perspectives such that\nthey cohere together into a loosely integrated whole. The reweaving of items in\nmemory is elicited by perturbations: experiences that increase psychological\nentropy because they are inconsistent with one's web of understandings. The\nprocess of responding to one perturbation often leads to other perturbations,\ni.e., other inconsistencies in one's web of understandings. Creative thinking\noften requires the capacity to shift between divergent and convergent modes of\nthought in response to the ever-changing demands of the creative task. Since\nuncreative individuals can reap the benefits of creativity by imitating\ncreators, using their inventions, or purchasing their artworks, it is not\nnecessary that everyone be creative. Agent based computer models of cultural\nevolution suggest that society functions best with a mixture of creative and\nuncreative individuals.

We\naddress this issue by using procedurally generated environments to construct\ndistinct training and test sets. Most notably, we introduce a new environment\ncalled CoinRun, designed as a benchmark for generalization in RL. Using\nCoinRun, we find that agents overfit to surprisingly large training sets.

Moreover, for\npotentials with a rich enough structure, the walls can join and form a (at\nlarge scales) homogeneous and isotropic network that dominates the energy\ndensity of the universe for some time before decaying. In this thesis, we study\nthe faith of large scale perturbations in a cosmology with a short period of\ndomain wall dominance. Treating the domain wall network as a relativistic\nelastic solid at large scales, we show that the perturbations that exited the\nhorizon during inflation get suppressed during the domain wall era, before\nre-entering the horizon. This power suppression occurs because, unlike a\nfluid-like universe, a solid-like universe can support sizable anisotropic\nstress gradients across large scales which effectively act as mass for the\nscalar and tensor modes. Interestingly, the amplitude of the primordial scalar\npower spectrum can be closer to one in this cosmology and still give the\nobserved value of $10^{-9}$ today. As a result, the usual bounds on the energy\nscale of inflation get relaxed to values closer to the (more natural) Planck\nscale. In the last part of this thesis, as an existence proof, we present a\nhybrid inflation model with $N$ `waterfall' fields that can realize the\nproposed cosmology. In this model, a domain wall network forms when an\napproximate $O(N)$ symmetry gets spontaneously broken at the end of inflation,\nand for $N \\geq 5$, we show that there is a region in parameter space where the\nnetwork dominates the energy density for a few e-folds before decaying and\nreheating the universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Dec 2018 04:35:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-07"}

The thousands of processed continuum images\nthat we will produce will prove useful in studies of distant galaxy clusters,\nradio AGN, as well as nearby galaxies and star forming regions. Besides the\nscientific returns, a uniform data processing pipeline run on a large volume of\ndata can be used in other interesting ways. For example, we will be able to\nmeasure various performance characteristics of the GMRT telescope and their\ndependence on waveband, time of day, RFI environment, backend, galactic\nlatitude etc. in a systematic way. A variety of data products such as\ncalibrated UVFITS data, sky images and AIPS processing logs will be delivered\nto users via a web-based interface. Data products will be compatible with\nstandard Virtual Observatory protocols.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Dec 2018 05:36:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-11"}

Systematically, we study two basic models, i.e., inverse\nscattering of plane waves by rigid bodies and inverse scattering of sources\nwith compact support. For both models, we show that the location of the objects\ncan not be uniquely recovered by the data. To solve this problem, we consider\nsimultaneously the incident point sources with one fixed source point and at\nmost three scattering strengths. We then establish some uniqueness results for\nsource scattering problem with multi-frequency phaseless far field data.\nFurthermore, a fast and stable phase retrieval approach is proposed based on a\nsimple geometric result which provides a stable reconstruction of a point in\nthe plane from three distances to given points. Difficulties arise for inverse\nscattering by rigid bodies due to the additional unknown far field pattern of\nthe point sources. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce an artificial\nrigid body into the system and show that the underlying rigid bodies can be\nuniquely determined by the corresponding phaseless far field data at a fixed\nfrequency. Noting that the far field pattern of the scattered field\ncorresponding to point sources is very small if the source point is far away\nfrom the scatterers, we propose an appropriate phase retrieval method for\nobstacle scattering problems, without using the artificial rigid body. Finally,\nwe propose several sampling methods for shape reconstruction with phaseless far\nfield data. Extended numerical examples in two dimensions are conducted with\nnoisy data, and the results further verify the effectiveness and robustness of\nthe proposed phase retrieval techniques and sampling methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Dec 2018 05:37:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2018 00:31:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

Despite a tremendous amount of research on the subject, there is still\nno satisfactory solution that can scale to billion-scale complex networks.\nLabelling-based methods are well-known for rendering fast response time to\ndistance queries; however, existing works can only construct labelling on\nmoderately large networks (million-scale) and cannot scale to large networks\n(billion-scale) due to their prohibitively large space requirements and very\nlong preprocessing time. In this work, we present novel techniques to\nefficiently construct distance labelling and process exact shortest path\ndistance queries for complex networks with billions of vertices and billions of\nedges. Our method is based on two ingredients: (i) a scalable labelling\nalgorithm for constructing minimal distance labelling, and (ii) a querying\nframework that supports fast distance-bounded search on a sparsified graph.\nThus, we first develop a novel labelling algorithm that can scale to graphs at\nthe billion-scale. Then, we formalize a querying framework for exact distance\nqueries, which combines our proposed highway cover distance labelling with\ndistance-bounded searches to enable fast distance computation. To speed up the\nlabelling construction process, we further propose a parallel labelling method\nthat can construct labelling simultaneously for multiple landmarks. We\nevaluated the performance of the proposed methods on 12 real-world networks.\nThe experiments show that the proposed methods can not only handle networks\nwith billions of vertices, but also be up to 70 times faster in constructing\nlabelling and save up to 90\\% of labelling space.

The main purpose of this article is to fill this gap by developing\na measure for the efficiency of markets that fulfill all the stated\nrequirements. It is shown that the new definition of efficiency, based on\ninformational-entropy, is equivalent to the two most used definitions of\nefficiency from Fama and Jensen. The new measure therefore enables steps to\nsettle the dispute over the state of efficiency in markets. Moreover, it is\nshown that inefficiency in a market can either arise from the possibility to\nuse information to predict an event with higher than chance level, or can\nemerge from wrong pricing/ quotes that do not reflect the right probabilities\nof possible events.

Intuitively, we humans use the inductive bias to compose\ncollocations and contextual inference in discourse. For example, when we see\nthe relation `person on bike', it is natural to replace `on' with `ride' and\ninfer `person riding bike on a road' even the `road' is not evident. Therefore,\nexploiting such bias as a language prior is expected to help the conventional\nencoder-decoder models less likely overfit to the dataset bias and focus on\nreasoning. Specifically, we use the scene graph --- a directed graph\n($\\mathcal{G}$) where an object node is connected by adjective nodes and\nrelationship nodes --- to represent the complex structural layout of both image\n($\\mathcal{I}$) and sentence ($\\mathcal{S}$). In the textual domain, we use\nSGAE to learn a dictionary ($\\mathcal{D}$) that helps to reconstruct sentences\nin the $\\mathcal{S}\\rightarrow \\mathcal{G} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{D} \\rightarrow\n\\mathcal{S}$ pipeline, where $\\mathcal{D}$ encodes the desired language prior;\nin the vision-language domain, we use the shared $\\mathcal{D}$ to guide the\nencoder-decoder in the $\\mathcal{I}\\rightarrow \\mathcal{G}\\rightarrow\n\\mathcal{D} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{S}$ pipeline. Thanks to the scene graph\nrepresentation and shared dictionary, the inductive bias is transferred across\ndomains in principle. We validate the effectiveness of SGAE on the challenging\nMS-COCO image captioning benchmark, e.g., our SGAE-based single-model achieves\na new state-of-the-art $127.8$ CIDEr-D on the Karpathy split, and a competitive\n$125.5$ CIDEr-D (c40) on the official server even compared to other ensemble\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Dec 2018 07:13:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 9 Dec 2018 05:09:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 01:32:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-12"}

For clinical\ncancer treatment, a specific pre-treatment indicator taking into account cancer\ncell type and patient radiosensitivity is of great value but it has been\nmissing.

Unfortunately, the space required to store these many\nnetworks, and the time required to execute them at test-time, prohibits their\nuse in applications where test sets are large (e.g., ImageNet). In this paper,\nwe present a method for compressing large, complex trained ensembles into a\nsingle network, where knowledge from a variety of trained deep neural networks\n(DNNs) is distilled and transferred to a single DNN. In order to distill\ndiverse knowledge from different trained (teacher) models, we propose to use\nadversarial-based learning strategy where we define a block-wise training loss\nto guide and optimize the predefined student network to recover the knowledge\nin teacher models, and to promote the discriminator network to distinguish\nteacher vs. student features simultaneously. The proposed ensemble method\n(MEAL) of transferring distilled knowledge with adversarial learning exhibits\nthree important advantages: (1) the student network that learns the distilled\nknowledge with discriminators is optimized better than the original model; (2)\nfast inference is realized by a single forward pass, while the performance is\neven better than traditional ensembles from multi-original models; (3) the\nstudent network can learn the distilled knowledge from a teacher model that has\narbitrary structures.

This expandable platform will achieve a significant\nimpact on Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) science and on the detection of Gravitational\nWave (GW) electromagnetic counterparts: the recent LIGO/VIRGO discoveries\ndemonstrated that the high-energy transient sky is still a field of extreme\ninterest. The very complex temporal variability of GRBs (up to the millisecond\nscale) combined with the spatial and temporal coincidence between GWs and their\nelectromagnetic counterparts suggest that upcoming instruments require sub-ms\ntime resolution combined with a transient localization accuracy lower than a\ndegree. The current phase of the ongoing HERMES project is focused on the\nrealization of a technological pathfinder with a small network (3 units) of\nnano-satellites to be launched in mid 2020. We will show the potential and\nprospects for short and medium-term development of the project, demonstrating\nthe disrupting possibilities for scientific investigations provided by the\ninnovative concept of a new \"modular astronomy\" with nano-satellites (e.g. low\ndeveloping costs, very short realization time). Finally, we will illustrate the\ncharacteristics of the HERMES Technological Pathfinder project, demonstrating\nhow the scientific goals discussed are actually already reachable with the\nfirst nano-satellites of this constellation. The detector architecture will be\ndescribed in detail, showing that the new generation of scintillators (e.g.\nGAGG:Ce) coupled with very performing Silicon Drift Detectors (SDD) and low\nnoise Front-End-Electronics (FEE) are able to extend down to few keV the\nsensitivity band of the detector.

However, when situations become irregular, deviations on the price\nscale can often be extreme and difficult to pinpoint precisely, which is a\nresult of the highly varying marginal costs of generating facilities at the\nedges of the load curve. In these situations it is useful to supplant a point\nforecast of price with a distributional forecast, in particular one whose tails\nare adaptive to the current production regime. This work outlines a methodology\nfor leveraging published bid/ask information from the Nord Pool market to\nconstruct such adaptive predictive distributions. Our methodology is a\nnon-standard application of the concept of error-dressing, which couples a\nfeature driven error distribution in volume space with a non-linear\ntransformation via the published bid/ask curves to obtain highly non-symmetric,\nadaptive price distributions. Using data from the Nord Pool market, we show\nthat our method outperforms more standard forms of distributional modeling.

This is also near the temperature\nat which the system structurally transitions from triclinic to a unique\nnear-cubic phase. High-precision measurements of the near-static dielectric\nconstant reveal that the structural phase transition is actually comprised of\nfour successive transformations upon cooling at T$_1$=110.7 K, T$_2$=109.5 K,\nT$_3$=109.1 K and T$_4$=107.8 K. In contrast to warming, only two transitions\noccur at T'$_4$=119.2 K and T'$_1$=120.9 K. The methyl groups in the near-cubic\nphase become slightly distorted according to existing neutron powder\ndiffraction measurements. Analysis of the 2$^6$=64 possible spin orientation\nconfigurations of the methyl groups reveal a 20-fold ground state degeneracy\npresiding in each molecule rendering the system to become highly unstable. From\nsuch, it is interpreted that T$_1$ and T$_2$ are temperatures at which the\nmolecules successively lower their symmetry to remove the energy degeneracy\nwhich involve methyl group elongation and further out-of-plane tilting. This\ntriggers the system to phase transition into the near-cubic phase which\ninvolves a shearing of the molecular planes and partial rotation of the methyl\ngroups at T$_3$ and T$_4$. We interpret the low temperature near-cubic phase to\nbe a manifestation of Jahn-Teller distortions based on energy degeneracies of\nthe orbital motion of protons in each molecule and suggest that the metastable\nnature of the phase transition originates from the methyl groups requiring a\nlarger amount of energy to order than to disorder.

The disadvantage of such\natomization processes is that the breakup is often highly irregular, causing a\nbroad distribution of droplet sizes. As these sizes are controlled by the\nligament corrugation and size, a monodisperse spray should consist of ligaments\nthat are both smooth and of equal size. A straightforward way of creating\nsmooth and equally sized ligaments is by droplet impact on a mesh. In this work\nwe show that this approach does however not produce monodisperse droplets, but\ninstead the droplet size distribution is very broad, with a large number of\nsmall satellite drops. We demonstrate that the fragmentation is controlled by a\njet instability, where initial perturbations caused by the injection process\nresult in long-wavelength disturbances that determine the final ligament\nbreakup. During destabilization the crests of these disturbances are connected\nby thin ligaments which are the leading cause of the large number of small\ndroplets.

The performance of the PS-DCT\nfeatures is shown to be good, and hence it can be used to supplement other\nfeatures for the speaker identification task. Speaker identification is also\nperformed using Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) features and combined\nwith the proposed features to improve its performance. For this pilot study, 30\nspeakers (14 female and 16 male) have been picked up randomly from the TIMIT\ndatabase for the speaker identification task. On this data, both the proposed\nfeatures and MFCC give an identification accuracy of 90% and 96.7% for codebook\nsizes of 16 and 32, respectively, and the combined features achieve 100%\nperformance. Apart from the speaker identification task, this work also shows\nthe capability of DCT to capture discriminative information from the speech\nsignal with minimal pre-processing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Dec 2018 10:35:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-07"}

Specifically, the direction of smooth\npursuit phases in optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) typically corresponds to the\ndirection of motion that dominates perceptual appearance at any given time.\nHere we report an improved analysis that continuously estimates perceived\nmotion in terms of `cumulative smooth pursuit'. In essence, smooth pursuit\nsegments are identified, interpolated where necessary, and joined\nprobabilistically into a continuous record of `cumulative smooth pursuit'\n(i.e., a probability of eye position disregarding blinks, saccades, signal\nlosses, and artefacts). The analysis is fully automated and robust in healthy,\ndevelopmental, and patient populations. To validate reliability, we compare\nvolitional reports of perceptual reversals in rivalry displays, and of physical\nreversals in non-rivalrous control displays. `Cumulative smooth pursuit'\ndetects physical reversals and estimates eye velocity more accurately than\nexisting methods do (Frassle et al., 2014).

It is shown that the\nrate of isomeric state excitation can be enhanced significantly with respect to\nother nucleus excitation processes in laser plasma or by an external coherent\nsource at the resonance wavelength. This enhancement is due to the process of\nnonlinear laser nuclear excitation based on the following. First, the atomic\ncurrent associated with the motion of valence electrons in strong field is a\nnonlinear function of the field amplitude. Secondly, the energy of photons at\nfrequency of the Ti:Sa laser fifth harmonic coincides with the energy of the\n229m Th state. Yield of this harmonic is much higher if the two-color (1st and\n2nd harmonics of the fundamental) is used. Thirdly, the intensity of the field\nproduced by valence electrons at atomic nucleus reaches the near-atomic value,\nwhich exceeds significantly the field strength associated with any other\nmechanism of laser plasma emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Dec 2018 12:07:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

We achieve this with a Convolutional\nNeural Network (CNN) that employs a stacked hourglass model as its main\nbuilding block. Intermediate supervision is used in several outputs of the\nproposed architecture in a staged approach. To aid the process of training and\ninference, hand segmentation masks are also estimated in such an intermediate\nsupervision step, and used to guide the subsequent depth estimation process. In\norder to train and evaluate the proposed method we compile and make publicly\navailable HandRGBD, a new dataset of 20,601 views of hands, each consisting of\nan RGB image and an aligned depth map. Based on HandRGBD, we explore variants\nof the proposed approach in an ablative study and determine the best performing\none. The results of an extensive experimental evaluation demonstrate that hand\ndepth estimation from a single RGB frame can be achieved with an accuracy of\n22mm, which is comparable to the accuracy achieved by contemporary low-cost\ndepth cameras. Such a 3D reconstruction of hands based on RGB information is\nvaluable as a final result on its own right, but also as an input to several\nother hand analysis and perception algorithms that require depth input.\nEssentially, in such a context, the proposed approach bridges the gap between\nRGB and RGBD, by making all existing RGBD-based methods applicable to RGB\ninput.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Dec 2018 12:16:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-07"}

A natural\nextension is to the local recovery of a set of $t$ erased symbols. There have\nbeen several approaches proposed for the handling of multiple erasures. The\napproach considered here, is one of sequential recovery meaning that the $t$\nerased symbols are recovered in succession, each time contacting at most $r$\nother symbols for assistance in recovery. Under the constraint that each erased\nsymbol be recoverable by contacting at most $r$ other code symbols, this\napproach is the most general and hence offers maximum possible code rate. We\ncharacterize the maximum possible rate of an LRC with sequential recovery for\nany $r \\geq 3$ and $t$. We do this by first deriving an upper bound on code\nrate and then going on to construct a {\\em binary} code that achieves this\noptimal rate. The upper bound derived here proves a conjecture made earlier\nrelating to the structure (but not the exact form) of the rate bound. Our\napproach also permits us to deduce the structure of the parity-check matrix of\na rate-optimal LRC with sequential recovery.\n  The parity-check matrix in turn, leads to a graphical description of the\ncode. The construction of a binary code having rate achieving the upper bound\nderived here makes use of this description.

The Turing instability is among the\nmost celebrated paradigms for pattern formation. In its original form, the\ndiffusion constants of the two mobile species need to be quite different from\neach other for the instability to develop. Unfortunately, this condition limits\nthe applicability of the theory. To overcome this impediment, and with the\nambitious long term goal to eventually reconcile theory and experiments, we\nhere propose an alternative mechanism for promoting the onset of patterns. To\nthis end a multi-species reaction-diffusion system is studied on a discrete,\nnetwork-like support: the instability is triggered by the non-normality of the\nembedding network.

In this study, a periodic method is presented for modeling\ntwo-dimensional periodic arrays of sub-wavelength emitters. This technique only\nrequires discretizing one period of the array, and thus is computationally\nbeneficial. In this method, the energy density emitted by the array is\nexpressed in terms of array's Green's functions. The array Green's functions\nare found using the discrete dipole approximation in a periodic manner by\nexpressing a single point source as a series of periodic arrays of\nphase-shifted point sources. The presented method can be employed for modeling\nperiodic arrays made of inhomogeneous and complex-shape emitters with\nnon-uniform temperature distribution. The proposed technique is verified\nagainst the non-periodic thermal discrete-dipole-approximation simulations, and\nit is demonstrated that this method can serve as a versatile and reliable tool\nfor studying near-field thermal emission by periodic arrays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Dec 2018 13:42:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Jun 2019 13:19:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-26"}

Among them, the optimization-based CW attack is\nthe most powerful as the produced adversarial samples present much less\ndistortion compared to other methods.

However, a system can still be vulnerable to adversarial samples that\nare designed to specifically evade these detection methods. One recent\ndetection scheme that has shown good performance is based on uncertainty\nestimates derived from Monte-Carlo dropout ensembles. Prior Networks, a new\nmethod of estimating predictive uncertainty, has been shown to outperform\nMonte-Carlo dropout on a range of tasks. One of the advantages of this approach\nis that the behaviour of a Prior Network can be explicitly tuned to, for\nexample, predict high uncertainty in regions where there are no training data\nsamples.

Devoid of this, we\npropose a novel probabilistic generative approach called Bidirectional Human\nmotion prediction GAN, or BiHMP-GAN. To be able to generate multiple probable\nhuman-pose sequences, conditioned on a given starting sequence, we introduce a\nrandom extrinsic factor r, drawn from a predefined prior distribution.\nFurthermore, to enforce a direct content loss on the predicted motion sequence\nand also to avoid mode-collapse, a novel bidirectional framework is\nincorporated by modifying the usual discriminator architecture. The\ndiscriminator is trained also to regress this extrinsic factor r, which is used\nalongside with the intrinsic factor (encoded starting pose sequence) to\ngenerate a particular pose sequence.

To resolve this issue, a lot of work has been conducted to\ncontrol the response quality such that low-quality responses cannot adversely\naffect the performance of the machine learning systems. Such work is referred\nto as the quality control for crowdsourcing. Past quality control research can\nbe divided into two major branches: quality control mechanism design and\nstatistical models. The first branch focuses on designing measures, thresholds,\ninterfaces and workflows for payment, gamification, question assignment and\nother mechanisms that influence workers' behaviour. The second branch focuses\non developing statistical models to perform effective aggregation of responses\nto infer correct responses.

This paper tackles\nthe question of whether Stan could use Python syntax while retaining its\nself-contained semantics. The answer is yes, that can be accomplished by\nreinterpreting the Python syntax. This paper introduces Yaps, a new frontend to\nStan based on reinterpreted Python. We tested Yaps on over a thousand Stan\nmodels and made it available open-source.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Dec 2018 01:24:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-12"}

The novel algorithms\nintroduced in this thesis can facilitate the development of strategies for\ngenerating weight balanced digraphs, in a distributed manner, and find numerous\napplications in coordination and control of multi-component systems. In the\nfirst part of this thesis, we introduce a novel distributed algorithm that\noperates over a static topology and solves the weight balancing problem when\nthe weights are restricted to be nonnegative integers.

SSD-based I/O caching is typically not\neffective in workloads with burst accesses in which the caching layer itself\nbecomes the performance bottleneck because of the large number of accesses.\nExisting I/O cache architectures mainly focus on maximizing the cache hit ratio\nwhile they neglect the average queue time of accesses. Previous studies\nsuggested bypassing the cache when burst accesses are identified. These\nschemes, however, are not applicable to a general cache configuration and also\nresult in significant performance degradation on burst accesses. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel I/O cache load balancing scheme (LBICA) with adaptive write\npolicy management to prevent the I/O cache from becoming performance bottleneck\nin burst accesses. Our proposal, unlike previous schemes, which disable the I/O\ncache or bypass the requests into the disk subsystem in burst accesses,\nselectively reduces the number of waiting accesses in the SSD queue and\nbalances the load between the I/O cache and the disk subsystem while providing\nthe maximum performance. The proposed scheme characterizes the workload based\non the type of in-queue requests and assigns an effective cache write policy.\nWe aim to bypass the accesses which 1) are served faster by the disk subsystem\nor 2) cannot be merged with other accesses in the I/O cache queue. Doing so,\nthe selected requests are responded by the disk layer, preventing from\noverloading the I/O cache. Our evaluations on a physical system shows that\nLBICA reduces the load on the I/O cache by 48% and improves the performance of\nburst workloads by 30% compared to the latest state-of-the-art load balancing\nscheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2018 19:36:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-21"}

It is attempted here. Classical\nfracture mechanics, as well as the current commercial softwares, predict\nvertical cracks to propagate without branching from the perforations of the\nhorizontal well casing, which are typically spaced at 10 m or more. However, to\nexplain the gas production rate at the wellhead, the crack spacing would have\nto be only about 0.1 m, which would increase the overall gas permeability of\nshale mass about 10,000$\\times$. This permeability increase has generally been\nattributed to a preexisting system of orthogonal natural cracks, whose spacing\nis about 0.1 m. But their average age is about 100 million years, and a recent\nanalysis indicated that these cracks must have been completely closed by\nsecondary creep of shale in less than a million years. Here it is considered\nthat the tectonic events that produced the natural cracks in shale must have\nalso created weak layers with nano- or micro-cracking damage. It is numerically\ndemonstrated that a greatly enhanced permeability along the weak layers, with a\ngreatly increased transverse Biot coefficient, must cause the fracking to\nengender lateral branching and the opening of hydraulic cracks along the weak\nlayers, even if these cracks are initially almost closed.

Comparing this value with the calculated reflectivity for\nperfect silicon, this factor increases to 40.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Dec 2018 06:07:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-04"}

Model-based testing and formal verification\ntechniques can be employed to enhance the reliability of software systems.\nFormal models form the basis and are prerequisite for the application of these\ntechniques. An emerging and promising model learning technique can complement\ntesting and verification techniques by providing learned models of black box\nsystems fully automatically. This paper surveys one such state of the art\ntechnique called model learning which recently has attracted much attention of\nresearchers especially from the domains of testing and verification. This\nsurvey paper reviews and provides comparison summaries highlighting the merits\nand shortcomings of learning techniques, algorithms, and tools which form the\nbasis of model learning. This paper also surveys the successful applications of\nmodel learning technique in multidisciplinary fields making it promising for\ntesting and verification of realistic systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Dec 2018 03:09:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-08"}
