Often\nstudents have preferences for bundles of course seats or course schedules over\nthe week, which need to be considered. The problem is a challenging distributed\nscheduling task requiring decision support. First-Come First-Served (FCFS) is\nsimple and the most widely used assignment rule in practice, but it leads to\ninefficient outcomes and envy in the allocation. Recent theoretical results\nsuggest alternatives with attractive economic and computational properties.\nBundled Probabilistic Serial (BPS) is a randomized mechanism satisfying ordinal\nefficiency, envy-freeness, and weak strategy-proofness. This mechanism also\nruns in polynomial time, which is important for the large problem instances in\nthe field. We report empirical results from a first implementation of BPS at\nthe Technical University of Munich, which allows us to provide important\nempirical metrics such as the size of the resulting matching, the average rank,\nthe profile, and the popularity of the assignments. These metrics were central\nfor the adoption of BPS. In particular, we compare these metrics to Random\nSerial Dictatorship with bundle bids (BRSD). The BRSD mechanism is used to\nsimulate the wide-spread First-Come First-Served (FCFS) mechanism and it allows\nus to compare FCFS (BRSD) and BPS.

EDGES employs a wide beam\nzenith-pointing dipole antenna centred on a declination of $-26.7^\\circ$. We\nmeasure the sky brightness temperature as a function of frequency averaged over\nthe EDGES beam from 244 nights of data acquired between 14 September 2016 to 27\nAugust 2017. We derive the spectral index, $\\beta$, as a function of local\nsidereal time (LST) using night-time data and a two-parameter fitting equation.\nWe find $-2.59<\\beta<-2.54 \\pm 0.011$ between 0 and 12 h LST, ignoring\nionospheric effects. When the Galactic Centre is in the sky, the spectral index\nflattens, reaching $\\beta = -2.46 \\pm 0.011$ at 18.2 h. The measurements are\nstable throughout the observations with night-to-night reproducibility of\n$\\sigma_{\\beta}<0.004$ except for the LST range of 7 to 12 h.

It typically needs to address\ntwo major problems: (1) How to answer visually-grounded questions, which is the\ncore challenge in visual question answering (VQA); (2) How to infer the\nco-reference between questions and the dialog history. An example of visual\nco-reference is: pronouns (\\eg, ``they'') in the question (\\eg, ``Are they on\nor off?'') are linked with nouns (\\eg, ``lamps'') appearing in the dialog\nhistory (\\eg, ``How many lamps are there?'') and the object grounded in the\nimage. In this work, to resolve the visual co-reference for visual dialog, we\npropose a novel attention mechanism called Recursive Visual Attention (RvA).\nSpecifically, our dialog agent browses the dialog history until the agent has\nsufficient confidence in the visual co-reference resolution, and refines the\nvisual attention recursively. The quantitative and qualitative experimental\nresults on the large-scale VisDial v0.9 and v1.0 datasets demonstrate that the\nproposed RvA not only outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, but also\nachieves reasonable recursion and interpretable attention maps without\nadditional annotations.

We show that for mimetic\ndark matter possessing a shift symmetry the mimetic energy density remains\npositive in time, provided appropriate boundary conditions are imposed on its\ninitial value, while in models without shift symmetry the positive energy\ndensity can be maintained by simply replacing $\\lambda\\to e^{\\lambda}$. The\nsame result also applies to mimetic $f(R)$ gravity, which is healthy if the\nusual stability conditions of the standard $f(R)$ gravity are assumed and\n$\\lambda>0$. In contrast, if we add mimetic matter to an unhealthy seed action,\nthe resulting mimetic gravity theory remains, in general, unstable. As an\nexample, we consider a scalar-tensor theory with the higher-derivative term\n$(\\Box \\varphi)^2$, which contains an Ostrogradski ghost. We also revisit\nresults regarding stability issues of linear perturbations around the FLRW\nbackground of the mimetic dark matter in the presence of ordinary scalar\nmatter.

The modes, whose Hamiltonian\nis not positive definite, are non-propagating (have zero sound speed) and are\nassociated with the mimetic matter itself.

In this paper, we employ the technique of model distillation\n(supervising a low-cost student model using the output of a high-cost teacher)\nto specialize accurate, low-cost semantic segmentation models to a target video\nstream. Rather than learn a specialized student model on offline data from the\nvideo stream, we train the student in an online fashion on the live video,\nintermittently running the teacher to provide a target for learning.

It partitions a data set into a hierarchical collection of\nclusters, and can provide a global view of (cluster) structure behind data\nacross different granularity levels. A hierarchical clustering (HC) of a data\nset can be naturally represented by a tree, called a HC-tree, where leaves\ncorrespond to input data and subtrees rooted at internal nodes correspond to\nclusters. Many hierarchical clustering algorithms used in practice are\ndeveloped in a procedure manner. Dasgupta proposed to study the hierarchical\nclustering problem from an optimization point of view, and introduced an\nintuitive cost function for similarity-based hierarchical clustering with nice\nproperties as well as natural approximation algorithms.\n  We observe that while Dasgupta's cost function is effective at\ndifferentiating a good HC-tree from a bad one for a fixed graph, the value of\nthis cost function does not reflect how well an input similarity graph is\nconsistent to a hierarchical structure. In this paper, we present a new cost\nfunction, which is developed based on Dasgupta's cost function, to address this\nissue. The optimal tree under the new cost function remains the same as the one\nunder Dasgupta's cost function. However, the value of our cost function is more\nmeaningful. The new way of formulating the cost function also leads to a\npolynomial time algorithm to compute the optimal cluster tree when the input\ngraph has a perfect HC-structure, or an approximation algorithm when the input\ngraph 'almost' has a perfect HC-structure. Finally, we provide further\nunderstanding of the new cost function by studying its behavior for random\ngraphs sampled from an edge probability matrix.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Dec 2018 18:50:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2018 20:08:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-19"}

Minor mergers ($q\\lesssim1/3$)\non the other hand, form non-rotating cores and the tidal reversal becomes less\nimportant. Low-density stellar cores scoured in (multiple) minor mergers are\nless tangentially biased. This implies that the nuclear stellar properties of\nmassive ETGs can be solely explained by stellar dynamical processes during\ntheir final assembly without any need for `feedback' from accreting black\nholes. We predict a strong correlation between decoupled cores, central\nanisotropy and merger history: decoupled cores form in binary mergers and we\npredict them to occur in elliptical galaxies with the strongest central\nanisotropy. Measurements of the central orbital structure are the key to\nunderstanding the number of mergers a given galaxy has experienced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Dec 2018 18:59:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2019 14:31:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-18"}

We apply theoretical\nmodels for the emission from ejecta-CSM interaction to our NUV nondetections,\nand place upper limits on the mass and radial extent of CSM in SN Ia progenitor\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Dec 2018 19:01:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-30"}

Prior work addresses the problem of\ndesigning hybrid precoders and combiner, yet focusing on finding solutions\nunder a total transmit power constraint. The design of hybrid precoders and\ncombiners in practical system, is constrained, however, by a per antenna\ntransmit power, since each antenna element in the array is connected to a power\namplifier (PA) that has to operate within its linear region. In this paper, we\nfocus on the problem of hybrid precoding and combining with per-antenna power\nconstraints, and under a frequency-selective bandlimited channel model. We\nfirst propose an all-digital solution to this problem, and develop a hybrid\nprecoding and combining strategy that aims at matching this solution by\nminimizing the chordal distance between the all-digital precoders (combiners)\nand their hybrid approximations. Finally, since minimizing this metric does not\nguarantee that the final spectral efficiency will be maximized, we optimize the\nresulting spectral efficiency taking into account the per-antenna power\nconstraints. Simulation results show the effectiveness of our all-digital and\nhybrid solutions, while emphasizing the differences with respect to the\ncorresponding solution under a total power constraints. As shown in our\nnumerical results, the proposed all-digital solution performs similarly to the\ncase in which a total power constraint is considered. Further, our proposed\nhybrid solution is also shown to exhibit near-optimum performance, and the\ninfluence of different system parameters is also shown, thereby showing the\nsuitability of our proposed framework to deploy practical mmWave MIMO systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Dec 2018 19:14:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2019 18:51:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-04"}

A number of recent papers have proposed methods for detecting\nanomalous image data that appear different from known inlier data samples,\nincluding reconstruction-based autoencoders. Autoencoders optimize the\ncompression of input data to a latent space of a dimensionality smaller than\nthe original input and attempt to accurately reconstruct the input using that\ncompressed representation. Since the latent vector is optimized to capture the\nsalient features from the inlier class only, it is commonly assumed that images\nof objects from outside of the training class cannot effectively be compressed\nand reconstructed.

The high quantities of dissociated\nhydrogen and atomic metals present in the dayside atmosphere of KELT-9b bear\nmore resemblance to a K-type star than a gas giant. We present a single\nobservation of KELT-9b during its secondary eclipse, taken with the Wide Field\nCamera on the Isaac Newton Telescope (INT). This observation was taken in the\nU-band, a window particularly sensitive to Rayleigh scattering.

Although we can place an\nobservational constraint of $A_g<$ 0.14, our models suggest that the actual\nvalue is considerably lower than this due to H$^-$ opacity.

We analyze the generalized running vacuum\nmodel, for which $\\Lambda(H)=A+BH^2+C\\dot{H}$, along with the two models\nobtained by setting $B$ or $C$ equal to zero. A null value for $C$ yields the\nclassical running vacuum model (RVM), while $B=0$ corresponds to what we term\nthe generalized running vacuum sub-case, or GRVS. Our main aim is to\ninvestigate whether these models can accommodate non-zero spatial curvature. To\nthis end, we carry out a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis using data for the\nobservables associated with Type-Ia supernovae, cosmic chronometers, the cosmic\nmicrowave background and baryon acoustic oscillations, as well as two values\nfor the Hubble constant. Then we include data relating to the growth of\nlarge-scale structure (LSS) and repeat the procedure. Our results indicate that\ntaking LSS observations into account helps to tighten constraints and determine\na definite sign for the model parameters. In the case of the RVM and GRVS, the\naddition of growth data results in dynamical vacuum energy being preferred to a\ncosmological constant at a little over $1\\sigma$. This happens in both the flat\nand non-flat scenarios -- there are only a few exceptions -- but comes at the\ncost of an extra parameter which can degrade the performance of the models (as\nassessed by model selection criteria). Of special relevance is the fact that\nthe inclusion of LSS data appears to increase compatibility with a flat\ngeometry. It also brings the constraints on the Hubble constant closer to the\nrange of values established by \\emph{Planck}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Dec 2018 20:28:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 6 Jun 2020 14:32:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-05"}

Also, as they are accumulated\nfrom everyday practices, it is often hard to have a balanced number of samples\nfor the types of diseases under study. These problems hinder the development of\nML and NLP methods for EMR data analysis. To tackle these problems, we\ndeveloped a model to generate synthetic text of EMRs called Medical Text\nGenerative Adversarial Network or mtGAN.

We evaluate\nthe model from micro-level, macro-level and application-level on a Chinese EMR\ntext dataset.

Much of the recent focus in the computer\nexperiment literature, where modeling is often via Gaussian process (GP)\nsurrogates, has been on space-filling designs, via maximin distance, Latin\nhypercube, etc. However, it is easy to demonstrate empirically that such\ndesigns disappoint when the model hyperparameterization is unknown, and must be\nestimated from data observed at the chosen design sites. This is true even when\nthe performance metric is prediction-based, or when the target of interest is\ninherently or eventually sequential in nature, such as in blackbox (Bayesian)\noptimization. Here we expose such inefficiencies, showing that in many cases\npurely random design is superior to higher-powered alternatives.

Flow-level measurement is widely used\nbecause it provides rich enough information while being resource efficient, in\ncontrast to the traffic-level solutions like SNMP and packet-level solutions\nlike tcpdump. Flow-level measurement requires to maintain a TFR for each active\nflow, and update the corresponding TFR when a packet arrives. In the scenario\nof high-speed networks, the processing time for each packet is only several or\ntens of nanoseconds, and there may be up to millions of concurrent active\nflows. Two requirements have to be met to be able to do flow-level measurement\nin this scenario, i.e., the memory size have to be large enough to maintain a\nTFR for each flow, and the access time of the memory have to be small enough to\nbe able to update the TFR for each packet. Unfortunately, SRAM, which is fast\nenough, is expensive and there are limited amount available for the measurement\ntasks, while DRAM, which is large in capacity, is slow and cannot support the\nper-packet access. In this paper, we proposed a solution, PriMe, by combining\nSRAM with DRAM, overcoming the resource limitation by exporting TFRs to the\nDRAM when necessary, while enjoying the fast access of SRAM. We designed a\npeculiar algorithm to reduce the frequency of exporting TFRs to DRAM, as well\nas an algorithm to reduce the accesses of DRAM in aggregating the TFRs exported\nfrom SRAM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Dec 2018 00:35:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-10"}

However, real MSIs\nare often corrupted by noises in the sensing process, which will further\ndeteriorate the performance of higher-level classification and recognition\ntasks. In this paper, we propose a Low-rank Tensor Dictionary Learning (LTDL)\nmethod for MSI denoising. Firstly, we extract blocks from the MSI and cluster\nthem into groups. Then instead of using the exactly low-rank model, we consider\na nearly low-rank approximation, which is closer to the latent low-rank\nstructure of the clean groups of real MSIs. In addition, we propose to learn an\nspatial dictionary and an spectral dictionary, which contain the spatial\nfeatures and spectral features respectively of the whole MSI and are shared\namong different groups. Hence the LTDL method utilizes both the latent low-rank\nprior of each group and the correlation of different groups via the shared\ndictionaries. Experiments on synthetic data validate the effectiveness of\ndictionary learning by the LTDL. Experiments on real MSIs demonstrate the\nsuperior denoising performance of the proposed method in comparison to\nstate-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Dec 2018 01:55:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-10"}

Although\naudio information has been exploited to improve video captioning in previous\nworks, it is usually regarded as an additional feature fed into a black box\nfusion machine. How are the words in the generated sentences associated with\nthe auditory and visual modalities? The problem is still not investigated.

We find that the supersaturated metastable NaCl solution reaches\nits limit of stability at sufficiently high salt concentrations, as indicated\nby the composition dependence of the salt chemical potential, indicating the\ntransition to a phase separation by spinodal decomposition. However, the\nmetastability limit of the NaCl solution does not correspond to spinodal\ndecomposition with respect to crystallization. We find that beyond this\nspinodal, a liquid/amorphous separation occurs in the aqueous solution, whereby\nthe ions first form disordered clusters. We term these clusters as \"amorphous\nsalt\". We also identify a transition from one- to two-step crystallization\nmechanism driven by a spinodal. In particular, crystallization from aqueous\nNaCl solution beyond the spinodal is a two-step process, in which the ions\nfirst phase-separate into disordered amorphous salt clusters, followed by the\ncrystallization of ions in the amorphous salt phase. In contrast, in the\naqueous NaCl solution at concentrations lower than the spinodal,\ncrystallization occurs via a one-step process, as the ions aggregate directly\ninto crystalline nuclei.

Due to varying motion of cameras or objects, the reference frame and\neach support frame are not aligned. Therefore, temporal alignment is a\nchallenging yet important problem for VSR. Previous VSR methods usually utilize\noptical flow between the reference frame and each supporting frame to wrap the\nsupporting frame for temporal alignment. Therefore, the performance of these\nimage-level wrapping-based models will highly depend on the prediction accuracy\nof optical flow, and inaccurate optical flow will lead to artifacts in the\nwrapped supporting frames, which also will be propagated into the reconstructed\nHR video frame. To overcome the limitation, in this paper, we propose a\ntemporal deformable alignment network (TDAN) to adaptively align the reference\nframe and each supporting frame at the feature level without computing optical\nflow. The TDAN uses features from both the reference frame and each supporting\nframe to dynamically predict offsets of sampling convolution kernels. By using\nthe corresponding kernels, TDAN transforms supporting frames to align with the\nreference frame. To predict the HR video frame, a reconstruction network taking\naligned frames and the reference frame is utilized.

Even in\nthe planar case, systematically studied in the present paper it leads to new\nresults in characterizing $n$ periodic trajectories vs. so-called $n$ elliptic\nperiodic trajectories, which are $n$-periodic in elliptical coordinates. The\ncharacterizations are done both in terms of the underlying elliptic curve and\ndivisors on it and in terms of polynomial functional equations, like Pell's\nequation. This new approach also sheds light on some classical results. In\nparticular we connect search for caustics which generate periodic trajectories\nwith three classical classes of extremal polynomials on two intervals,\nintroduced by Zolotarev and Akhiezer. The main classifying tool are winding\nnumbers, for which we provide several interpretations, including one in terms\nof numbers of points of alternance of extremal polynomials.

Major\nInternet Service Providers (ISPs) want to enable UAV-provided services (UPS) to\nimprove and enrich the current mobile services for additional profit. This\nprofit-maximization problem is not easy as the UAV has limited energy storage\nand needs to fly closely to serve users, requiring an optimal energy allocation\nfor balancing both hovering time and service capacity. When hovering in a\nhotspot, how the UAV should dynamically price its capacity-limited UPS\naccording to randomly arriving users with private service valuations is another\nquestion. We prove that the UAV should ask for a higher price if the leftover\nhovering time is longer or its service capacity is smaller, and its expected\nprofit approaches to that under complete user information if the hovering time\nis sufficiently large. As the hotspot's user occurrence rate increases, a\nshorter hovering time or a larger service capacity should be allocated.\nFinally, when the UAV faces multiple hotspot candidates with different user\noccurrence rates and flying distances, we prove that it is optimal to deploy\nthe UAV to serve a single hotspot. With multiple UAVs, however, this result can\nbe reversed with UAVs' forking deployment to different hotspots.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Dec 2018 05:11:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-10"}

A Bayesian\napproach to statistical inference is the most complete method for model\nselection and uncertainty quantification of kinetic parameters from single-cell\ndata. This approach is impractical because current numerical algorithms are too\nslow to handle typical models of gene expression. To solve this problem, we\nfirst show that time-dependent mRNA distributions of discrete-state models of\ngene expression are dynamic Poisson mixtures, whose mixing kernels are\ncharacterized by a piece-wise deterministic Markov process. We combined this\nanalytical result with a kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm to create a hybrid\nnumerical method that accelerates the calculation of time-dependent mRNA\ndistributions by 1000-fold compared to current methods. We then integrated the\nhybrid algorithm into an existing Monte Carlo sampler to estimate the Bayesian\nposterior distribution of many different, competing models in a reasonable\namount of time. We validated our method of accelerated Bayesian inference on\nseveral synthetic data sets. Our results show that kinetic parameters can be\nreasonably constrained for modestly sampled data sets, if the model is known\n\\textit{a priori}.

If most of the hard X-rays from the\ncentral disk are obscured by the wind, the source will display a blackbody-like\nspectrum with a luminosity scaled with the mass of the compact object. From the\nChandra archive of nearby galaxies, we selected a sample of luminous and very\nsoft sources and excluded contaminations from foreground objects and supernova\nremnants. They are found to be preferentially associated with late-type\ngalaxies. The majority of sources in our sample are either too hot or too\nluminous to be explained by nuclear burning on the surface of white dwarfs, and\nare argued to be powered by accretion. The most likely explanation is that they\nare due to emission from the photosphere of a wind driven by supercritical\naccretion onto compact objects. Their blackbody luminosity ranges from ~10^37\nto nearly 10^40 erg/s, indicative of the presence of both neutron stars and\nstellar-mass black holes. The blackbody luminosity also shows a possible\nbimodal distribution, albeit at low significance, peaked around the Eddington\nlimit for neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes, respectively. If this can\nbe confirmed, it will be smoking gun evidence that supercritical accretion\npowers thick winds.

The\ncommon practice to evaluate the resilience to faults of an application is\nrandom fault injection, a method that can be highly time consuming. While\nresilience prediction modeling has been recently proposed to predict\napplication resilience in a faster way than fault injection, it can only\npredict a single class of fault manifestation (SDC) and there is no evidence\ndemonstrating that it can work on previously unseen programs, which greatly\nlimits its re-usability. We present PARIS, a resilience prediction method that\naddresses the problems of existing prediction methods using machine learning.\nUsing carefully-selected features and a machine learning model, our method is\nable to make resilience predictions of three classes of fault manifestations\n(success, SDC, and interruption) as opposed to one class like in current\nresilience prediction modeling. The generality of our approach allows us to\nmake prediction on new applications, i.e., previously unseen applications,\nproviding large applicability to our model.

This result is often\nrelated to a reformulation of the fourth-order equations for the metric into a\nset of second-order equations for a multiplet of fields, including a massive\nscalar field and a massive spin-2 field. In this article we investigate an\nissue which does not seem to have been addressed so far: in ordinary\ngeneral-relativistic field theories, all fundamental fields (i.e. fields with\ndefinite spin and mass) reduce to test fields in some appropriate limit of the\nmodel, where they cease to act as sources for the metric curvature. In this\nlimit, each of the fundamental fields can be excited from its ground state\nindependently from the others. The question is: does higher-derivative gravity\nadmit a test-field limit for its fundamental fields? It is easy to show that\nfor a f(R) theory the test-field limit does exist; then, we consider the case\nof Lagrangians quadratically depending on the full Ricci tensor. We show that\nthe constraint binding together the scalar field and the massive spin-2 field\ndoes not disappear in the limit where they should be expected to act as test\nfields, except for a particular choice of the Lagrangian, which cause the\nscalar field to disappear (reducing to 7 DOF).

We study the problem of minifying\nCascading Style Sheets (CSS) --- the de facto language for styling web\ndocuments. Traditionally, CSS minifiers focus on simple syntactic\ntransformations (e.g. shortening colour names). In this paper, we propose a new\nminification method based on merging similar rules in a CSS file.\n  We consider safe transformations of CSS files, which preserve the semantics\nof the CSS file. The semantics of CSS files are sensitive to the ordering of\nrules in the file. To automatically identify a rule merging opportunity that\nbest minimises file size, we reduce the rule-merging problem to a problem on\nCSS-graphs, i.e., node-weighted bipartite graphs with a dependency ordering on\nthe edges, where weights capture the number of characters (e.g. in a selector\nor in a property declaration). Roughly speaking, the corresponding CSS-graph\nproblem concerns minimising the total weight of a sequence of bicliques\n(complete bipartite subgraphs) that covers the CSS-graph and respects the edge\norder.\n  We provide the first full formalisation of CSS3 selectors and reduce\ndependency detection to satisfiability of quantifier-free integer linear\narithmetic, for which highly-optimised SMT-solvers are available. To solve the\nabove NP-hard graph optimisation problem, we show how Max-SAT solvers can be\neffectively employed. We have implemented our algorithms using Max-SAT and\nSMT-solvers as backends, and tested against approximately 70 real-world\nexamples (including the top 20 most popular websites). In our benchmarks, our\ntool yields larger savings than six well-known minifiers (which do not perform\nrule-merging, but support many other optimisations). Our experiments also\nsuggest that better savings can be achieved in combination with one of these\nsix minifiers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Dec 2018 11:54:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-12"}

At the beginning of each period,\neach buyer draws a private valuation for the item to be sold in that period and\nthis valuation is independent across buyers and periods. The auction can be\ndynamic in the sense that the auction at period $t$ can be conditional on the\nbids in that period and all previous periods, subject to certain appropriately\ndefined incentive compatible and individually rational conditions. Perhaps not\nsurprisingly, the revenue optimal dynamic auctions are computationally hard to\nfind and existing literatures that aim to approximate the optimal auctions are\nall based on solving complex dynamic programs. It remains largely open on the\nstructural interpretability of the optimal dynamic auctions.\n  In this paper, we show that any optimal dynamic auction is a virtual welfare\nmaximizer subject to some monotone allocation constraints. In particular, the\nexplicit definition of the virtual value function above arises naturally from\nthe primal-dual analysis by relaxing the monotone constraints. We further\ndevelop an ironing technique that gets rid of the monotone allocation\nconstraints. Quite different from Myerson's ironing approach, our technique is\nmore technically involved due to the interdependence of the virtual value\nfunctions across buyers. We nevertheless show that ironing can be done\napproximately and efficiently, which in turn leads to a Fully Polynomial Time\nApproximation Scheme of the optimal dynamic auction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Dec 2018 12:11:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-10"}

This appears to be new even in the context of Gabor analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Dec 2018 13:19:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-10"}

There is a growing body of literature, that\ncalcium sulfate forms essentially through a non-classical nanoparticle- or\ncluster-mediated crystallisation process. At the early stages of precipitation\ncalcium sulfate crystals grow through the reorganization and coalescence of\naggregates rather than through classical unit addition.

Instead the growth\nprocess yields a final imperfect mesocrystal of the overall morphology\nresembling that of a single crystal, yet composed of smaller nano-domains.\nHence, our data indicate that organic-free mesocrystal grown by a particle\nmediated-pathway may preserve a 'memory or 'imprint' of the non-classical\ngrowth process in the final crystal structure, something that has been largely\noverlooked until now.

For this\nreason, wells are typically modelled as lower-dimensional sources. In this\nwork, we consider a coupled 1D-3D flow model, in which the well is modelled as\na line source in the reservoir domain and endowed with its own 1D flow\nequation. The flow between well and reservoir can then be modelled in a fully\ncoupled manner by applying a linear filtration law.\n  The line source induces a logarithmic type singularity in the reservoir\npressure that is difficult to resolve numerically. We present here a\nsingularity removal method for the model equations, resulting in a reformulated\ncoupled 1D-3D flow model in which all variables are smooth. The singularity\nremoval is based on a solution splitting of the reservoir pressure, where it is\ndecomposed into two terms: an explicitly given, lower regularity term capturing\nthe solution singularity and some smooth background pressure. The singularities\ncan then be removed from the system by subtracting them from the governing\nequations. Finally, the coupled 1D-3D flow equations can be reformulated so\nthey are given in terms of the well pressure and the background reservoir\npressure. As these variables are both smooth (i.e. non-singular), the\nreformulated model has the advantage that it can be approximated using any\nstandard numerical method.

In\nthis research, we studied a variety of malware and methods of intrusion\ndetection, provide an efficient method for detecting attacks and utilizing\ndimension reduction.Thus, we will be able to detect attacks by carefully\ncombining these two algorithms and pre-processes that are performed before the\ntwo on the input data. The main question raised is how we can identify attacks\non computer networks with the above-mentioned method. In anomalies diagnostic\nmethod, by identifying behavior as a normal behavior for the user, the host, or\nthe whole system, any deviation from this behavior is considered as an abnormal\nbehavior, which can be a potential occurrence of an attack. The network\nintrusion detection system is used by anomaly detection method that uses the\nSVM algorithm for classification and SVD to reduce the size. Steps of the\nproposed method include pre-processing of the data set, feature selection,\nsupport vector machine, and evaluation.The NSL-KDD data set has been used to\nteach and test the proposed model. In this study, we inferred the intrusion\ndetection using the SVM algorithm for classification and SVD for diminishing\ndimensions with no classification algorithm.Also the KNN algorithm has been\ncompared in situations with and without diminishing dimensions,the results have\nshown that the proposed method has a better performance than comparable\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Dec 2018 10:21:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2018 12:23:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-14"}

The bare Higgs boson mass then\nchanges sign below the Planck scale, such that the SM in the early universe is\nin the symmetric phase. The cutoff enhanced Higgs mass term as well as the\nquartically enhanced cosmological constant term provide a large positive dark\nenergy which triggers the inflation of the early universe. Reheating follows\nvia the decays of the four unstable heavy Higgs particles, predominantly into\ntop-antitop pairs, which at this stage are still massless. Preheating is\nsuppressed in SM inflation since in the symmetric phase bosonic decay channels\nare absent at tree level.

The zero of of the Higgs mass\ncounter term triggers the electroweak phase transition from the low energy\nHiggs phase and to the symmetric phase above the transition point.

In sleep medicine, clinicians\ninterpret raw EEG signals in so-called sleep stages, which are assigned by\nexperts to every 30s window of signal. For diagnosis, they also rely on shorter\nprototypical micro-architecture events which exhibit variable durations and\nshapes, such as spindles, K-complexes or arousals. Annotating such events is\ntraditionally performed by a trained sleep expert, making the process time\nconsuming, tedious and subject to inter-scorer variability. To automate this\nprocedure, various methods have been developed, yet these are event-specific\nand rely on the extraction of hand-crafted features.\n  New method: We propose a novel deep learning architecure called Dreem One\nShot Event Detector (DOSED).

Among the new directions of use, research conducted on Mobile\nLearning Games (MLGs) seems very promising. In this article we propose to\nidentify the MLGs from the most referenced research articles and that have\nproven their value in educational context, in order to determine their features\nand impact on learners. This study will then allow us to define the common\ncharacteristics of these MLGs and identify the main problems that occur when\nthey are used by teachers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Dec 2018 13:46:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-27"}

Different\noptimization techniques are proposed which are competing for the best solution.\nParticle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a new, advanced, and most powerful\noptimization methodology that performs empirically well on several optimization\nproblems. It is the extensively used Swarm Intelligence (SI) inspired\noptimization algorithm used for finding the global optimal solution in a\nmultifaceted search region. Data clustering is one of the challenging real\nworld applications that invite the eminent research works in variety of fields.\nApplicability of different PSO variants to data clustering is studied in the\nliterature, and the analyzed research work shows that, PSO variants give poor\nresults for multidimensional data. This paper describes the different\nchallenges associated with multidimensional data clustering and scope of\nresearch on optimizing the clustering problems using PSO. We also propose a\nstrategy to use hybrid PSO variant for clustering multidimensional numerical,\ntext and image data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Dec 2018 17:05:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-29"}
