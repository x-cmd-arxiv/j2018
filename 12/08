In the\ncase of the two-dimensional Lieb lattice, we extend this further and show how\nto analytically obtain the entire spectrum in the presence of open boundaries\nin both directions, where it has a clear interpretation in terms of bulk, edge,\nand corner states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Dec 2018 16:42:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Feb 2019 17:00:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

In such cases, knowledge transfer from related\ndomains, where labels are abundant, could greatly reduce the need for extensive\nlabeling efforts. In this scenario, transfer learning comes in hand. In this\npaper, we propose Deep Variational Transfer (DVT), a variational autoencoder\nthat transfers knowledge across domains using a shared latent Gaussian mixture\nmodel. Thanks to the combination of a semi-supervised ELBO and parameters\nsharing across domains, we are able to simultaneously: (i) align all supervised\nexamples of the same class into the same latent Gaussian Mixture component,\nindependently from their domain; (ii) predict the class of unsupervised\nexamples from different domains and use them to better model the occurring\nshifts. We perform tests on MNIST and USPS digits datasets, showing DVT's\nability to perform transfer learning across heterogeneous datasets.\nAdditionally, we present DVT's top classification performances on the MNIST\nsemi-supervised learning challenge. We further validate DVT on a astronomical\ndatasets. DVT achieves states-of-the-art classification performances,\ntransferring knowledge across real stars surveys datasets, EROS, MACHO and\nHiTS, . In the worst performance, we double the achieved F1-score for rare\nclasses.

Using a Principle Component Analysis and the BACCHUS\nautomated spectral analysis code, we determined stellar parameters and\nabundances of up to 24 elements for each of our targets, which range in\ntemperature from 6000 to 4600 K. The average derived iron abundance for the\nthree G stars is 0.17+/-0.07 dex, consistent with the 0.12+/-0.04 dex derived\nby Boesgaard et al. (2013) for their sample of 11 solar-type Praesepe members,\nwhich included these G stars. To investigate the efficacy of using automated\nroutines to derive the abundances of cooler main-sequence stars, we compared\nthe abundances of the K dwarfs to those of the G dwarfs. Our abundances are\nconsistent to <=0.1~dex for 13 of the 18 elements we report for all five of the\nstars, providing more evidence that G and K stars in a given open cluster are\nchemically homogeneous. The median difference between the mean G and K stars\nabundances is 0.08+/-0.05 dex, despite serious challenges with the noisier data\nfor the fainter K dwarfs.

For\nexample, d-Set Matching for integers d>2 is the problem of finding a matching\nof size at least k in a given d-uniform hypergraph and has kernels with O(k^d)\nedges. Bodlaender et al. [JCSS 2009], Fortnow and Santhanam [JCSS 2011], Dell\nand Van Melkebeek [JACM 2014] developed a framework for proving lower bounds on\nthe kernel size for certain problems, under the complexity-theoretic hypothesis\nthat coNP is not contained in NP/poly. Under the same hypothesis, we show tight\nlower bounds for the kernelization of d-Set Matching and other packing\nproblems.\n  Our bounds are tight for d-Set Matching: It does not have kernels with\nO(k^{d-{\\epsilon}}) edges for any {\\epsilon}>0 unless the hypothesis fails. By\nreduction, this transfers to a bound of O(k^{d-1-{\\epsilon}}) for the problem\nof finding k vertex-disjoint cliques of size d in standard graphs. Obtaining\ntight bounds for graph packing problems is challenging: We make first progress\nin this direction by showing non-trivial kernels with O(k^2.5) edges for the\nproblem of finding k vertex-disjoint paths of three edges each. If the paths\nhave d edges each, we improve the straightforward O(k^{d+1}) kernel to a\nuniform polynomial kernel where the exponent of the kernel size is independent\nof k.\n  Most of our lower bound proofs follow a general scheme that we discover: To\nexclude kernels of size O(k^{d-{\\epsilon}}) for a problem in d-uniform\nhypergraphs, one should reduce from a carefully chosen d-partite problem that\nis still NP-hard. As an illustration, we apply this scheme to the vertex cover\nproblem, which allows us to replace the number-theoretical construction by Dell\nand Van Melkebeek [JACM 2014] with shorter elementary arguments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Dec 2018 18:41:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-10"}

Such a scenario could explain the formation of the new population of\nmassive black holes detected by the LIGO/VIRGO gravitational wave laser\ninterferometers. We probe that scenario by performing general relativistic\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulations of differentially rotating massive stars\nsupported by thermal radiation pressure plus a gas pressure perturbation. The\nstars are initially threaded by a dynamically weak, poloidal magnetic field\nconfined to the stellar interior. We find that magnetic braking and turbulent\nviscous damping via magnetic winding and the magnetorotational instability in\nthe bulk of the star redistribute angular momentum, damp differential rotation\nand induce the formation of a massive and nearly uniformly rotating inner core\nsurrounded by a Keplerian envelope. The core + disk configuration evolves on a\nsecular timescale and remains in quasi-stationary equilibrium until the\ntermination of our simulations. Our results suggest that the high degree of\ndifferential rotation required for $m=2$ seed density perturbations to trigger\ngas fragmentation and binary black hole formation is likely to be suppressed\nduring the normal lifetime of the star prior to evolving to the point of\ndynamical instability to collapse. Other cataclysmic events, such as stellar\nmergers leading to collapse, may therefore be necessary to reestablish\nsufficient differential rotation and density perturbations to drive\nnonaxisymmetric modes leading to binary black hole formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Dec 2018 19:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 20:04:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 8 Apr 2019 03:57:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-09"}

The timely arrival of\nspecialist ambulance crew in particular often makes the difference between life\nand death. As a consequence, it is critical that emergency ambulance services\nachieve short response times. This objective sets a considerable challenge to\nambulance services worldwide, especially in metropolitan areas where the\ndensity of incident occurrence and traffic congestion are high. Using London as\na case study, in this paper we consider the advantages and limitations of\ndata-driven methods for ambulance routing and navigation. Our long-term aim is\nto enable considerable improvements to their operational efficiency through the\nautomated generation of more effective response strategies and tactics. A key\ningredient of our approach is to use a large historical dataset of incidents\nand ambulance location traces to model route selection and arrival times.\nWorking on the London road network graph modified to reflect the differences\nbetween emergency and civilian vehicle traffic, we develop a methodology for\nthe precise estimation of expected ambulance speed at the individual road\nsegment level. We demonstrate how a model that exploits this information\nachieves best predictive performance by implicitly capturing route-specific\npersistent patterns in changing traffic conditions. We then present a\npredictive method that achieves a high route similarity score while minimising\njourney duration error. This is achieved through the combination of a technique\nthat correctly predicts routes selected by the current navigation system of the\nLondon Ambulance Service and our best performing speed estimation model.

To obtain bounds on\ncolor-triplets and color-singlets of charges up to |Q|=8, we recast searches\nfor signatures of two production channels: the \"open\" channel - where the\nparticles are pair-produced above threshold, and are detectable in dedicated\nLHC searches for stable multiply charged leptons, and the \"closed\" channel -\nwhere a particle-antiparticle pair is produced as a bound state, detectable in\nsearches for a diphoton resonance. We recast the open lepton searches by\nincorporating the relevant strong-interaction effects for color-triplets. In\nboth open and closed production, we provide a careful assessment of\nphoton-induced processes using the accurate LUXqed PDF, resulting in\nsubstantially weaker bounds than previously claimed in the literature for the\ncolorless case.

This paper\nintroduces methods for obtaining quantitative morphological features from\nmicrovasculature images obtained by non-contrast ultrasound imaging. Those\nimages suffer from the artifact that limit quantitative analysis of the vessel\nmorphological features. In this paper we introduce processing steps to increase\naccuracy of the morphological assessment for quantitative vessel analysis in\npresence of these artifact. Specifically, artificats are reduced by additional\nfiltering and vessel segments obtained by skeletonization of the regularized\nmicrovasculature images are further analyzed to satisfy additional constraints,\nsuch as diameter, and length of the vessel segments. Measurement of some\nmorphological metrics, such as tortuosity, depends on preserving large vessel\ntrunks that may be broken down into multiple branches. We propose two methods\nto address this problem. In the first method, small vessel segments are\nsuppressed in the vessel filtering process via adjusting the size scale of the\nregularization. Hence, tortuosity of the large trunks can be more accurately\nestimated by preserving longer vessel segments. In the second approach, small\nconnected vessel segments are removed by a combination of morphological erosion\nand dilation operations on the segmented vasculature images. These methods are\ntested on representative in vivo images of breast lesion microvasculature, and\nthe outcomes are discussed. This paper provides a tool for quantification of\nmicrovasculature image from non-contrast ultrasound imaging may result in\npotential biomarkers for diagnosis of some diseases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Dec 2018 22:14:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-11"}

Special attention is given to the dispersive fluxes, which are\nshown to be a significant fraction of the total fluxes within the roughness\nsublayers. Based on point-wise quadrant analysis, the turbulent components of\nthe transport of momentum and scalars are found to be similar in general,\nalbeit with increasing dissimilarity for roughnesses with low frontal blockage.\nHowever, strong dissimilarity is noted between the dispersive momentum and\nscalar fluxes, especially below the top of the roughness elements. In general,\nturbulence is found to transport momentum more efficiently than scalars, while\nthe reverse applies for the dispersive contributions. The effects of varying\nsurface geometries, measured by the frontal density, can be pronounced on both\nturbulent and dispersive fluxes. Increasing frontal density induces a general\ntransition in the flow from a rough boundary-layer type to a mixed-layer-like\ntype. This transition results in an increase in the efficiency of turbulent\nmomentum transport, but the reverse occurs for scalars due to reduced\ncontributions from large scale motions in the roughness sublayers.

While successful in some situations,\nexisting methods exhibit a number of deficiencies which limit their predictive\ncapability in many cases of interest, for instance in many flows involving\nsmooth wall separation.

Given\nUAV's agility and mobility, a key question is how to adapt UAV deployment to\nbest cater to the instantaneous wireless traffic in a territory. In this paper,\nwe propose an adaptive deployment scheme for a UAV-aided communication network,\nwhere the UAV adapts its displacement direction and distance to serve randomly\nmoving users' instantaneous traffic in the target cell. In our adaptive scheme,\nthe UAV does not need to learn users' exact locations in real time, but chooses\nits displacement direction based on a simple majority rule by flying to the\nspatial sector with the greatest number of users in the cell. To balance the\nservice qualities of the users in different sectors, we further optimize the\nUAV's displacement distance in the chosen sector to maximize the average\nthroughput and the successful transmission probability, respectively. We prove\nthat the optimal displacement distance for average throughput maximization\ndecreases with the user density: the UAV moves to the center of the chosen\nsector when the user density is small and the UAV displacement becomes mild\nwhen the user density is large. In contrast, the optimal displacement distance\nfor success probability maximization does not necessarily decrease with the\nuser density and further depends on the target signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)\nthreshold. Extensive simulations show that the proposed adaptive deployment\nscheme outperforms the traditional non-adaptive scheme, especially when the\nuser density is not large.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Dec 2018 04:32:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-11"}

However, the influence of\nthe material hardening law has received very limited attention, with isotropic\nhardening being the default choice if cyclic loads are absent. The present work\nextends the existing studies of monotonic mode I/II steady-state crack\npropagation with the goal to compare the predictions from an isotropic\nhardening model with that of a kinematic hardening model. The work is conducted\nthrough a purpose-built steady-state framework that directly delivers the\nsteady-state solution. In order to provide a fracture criterion, a cohesive\nzone model is adopted and embedded at the crack tip in the steady-state\nframework, while a control algorithm for the far-field, that significantly\nreduces the number of equilibrium iterations is employed to couple the\nfar-field loading to the correct crack tip opening. Results show that the\nsteady-state fracture toughness (shielding ratio) obtained for a kinematic\nhardening material is larger than for the corresponding isotropic hardening\ncase. The difference between the isotropic and kinematic model is tied to the\nnonproportional loading conditions and reverse plasticity. This also explains\nthe vanishing difference in the shielding ratio when considering mode II crack\npropagation as the non-proportional loading is less pronounced and the reverse\nplasticity is absent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Dec 2018 09:43:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-18"}

NMTree disentangles the visual grounding\nfrom the composite reasoning, allowing the former to only focus on primitive\nand easy-to-generalize patterns.

However, these models are vulnerable to certain inputs, the\nadversarial examples, which although are not easily perceived by humans, they\ncan lead a neural network to produce faulty results. This paper focuses on the\ndetection of adversarial examples, which are created for convolutional neural\nnetworks that perform image classification. We propose three methods for\ndetecting possible adversarial examples and after we analyze and compare their\nperformance, we combine their best aspects to develop an even more robust\napproach. The first proposed method is based on the regularization of the\nfeature vector that the neural network produces as output. The second method\ndetects adversarial examples by using histograms, which are created from the\noutputs of the hidden layers of the neural network. These histograms create a\nfeature vector which is used as the input of an SVM classifier, which\nclassifies the original input either as an adversarial or as a real input.\nFinally, for the third method we introduce the concept of the residual image,\nwhich contains information about the parts of the input pattern that are\nignored by the neural network. This method aims at the detection of possible\nadversarial examples, by using the residual image and reinforcing the parts of\nthe input pattern that are ignored by the neural network. Each one of these\nmethods has some novelties and by combining them we can further improve the\ndetection results. For the proposed methods and their combination, we present\nthe results of detecting adversarial examples on the MNIST dataset. The\ncombination of the proposed methods offers some improvements over similar state\nof the art approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Dec 2018 11:52:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-11"}

Therefore, accurately\nestimating the remaining useful life (RUL) for REBs are of crucial importance\nto ensure the reliability and safety of mechanical systems. To tackle this\nchallenge, model-based approaches are often limited by the complexity of\nmathematical modeling. Conventional data-driven approaches, on the other hand,\nrequire massive efforts to extract the degradation features and construct\nhealth index. In this paper, a novel online data-driven framework is proposed\nto exploit the adoption of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) in\npredicting the RUL of bearings. More concretely, the raw vibrations of training\nbearings are first processed using the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) and a\nnovel nonlinear degradation indicator is constructed as the label for learning.\nThe CNN is then employed to identify the hidden pattern between the extracted\ndegradation indicator and the vibration of training bearings, which makes it\npossible to estimate the degradation of the test bearings automatically.\nFinally, testing bearings' RULs are predicted by using a $\\epsilon$-support\nvector regression model. The superior performance of the proposed RUL\nestimation framework, compared with the state-of-the-art approaches, is\ndemonstrated through the experimental results.

Techniques include breadth-first search to find the pith of the\ntree, edge detection to approximate the radius, and a conversion to polar\ncoordinates to threshold and segment phyllotactic features. Intensity values\nfrom Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the trunk are projected onto the\nsurface of a perfect cylinder to find the locations of traces in the \"boundary\nimage\". Mathematical phyllotaxy provides a means to capture the patterns in the\nboundary image by modeling phyllotactic parameters. Our cherry tree specimen\nhas the conspicuous parastichy pair $(2,3)$, phyllotactic fraction 2/5, and\ndivergence angle of approximately 143 degrees.\n  The methods described not only provide a framework to study phyllotaxy, but\nfor image processing of volumetric image data in plants. Our results have\npractical implications for orchard rejuvenation and directed approaches to\ninfluence tree architecture. The study of epicormic structures, which are\nhidden within secondary growth, using tomographic methods also opens the\npossibility of studying the genetic and environmental basis of such structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Dec 2018 14:00:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-11"}

In this scenario, the\ntemporal component of the helicity-1 mode is an auxiliary field and can be\nintegrated out in terms of the time derivative of the helicity-0 mode, so that\nthe background dynamics effectively reduces to that in single-field inflation\nmodulated by a parameter $\\beta$ associated to the coupling between helicity-0\nand helicity-1 modes.

One is a BCS model with separable energy-dependent interactions, the\nother - a 2D topological superconductor with spin-orbit coupling and a\nband-splitting external field. The long-time quantum quench dynamics at\nintegrable points of these models are well understood. Namely, the squared\nmagnitude of the time-dependent order parameter $\\Delta(t)$ can either vanish\n(Phase I), reach a nonzero constant (Phase II), or periodically oscillate as an\nelliptic function (Phase III). We demonstrate that nonintegrable models too\nexhibit some or all of these nonequilibrium phases. Remarkably, elliptic\nperiodic oscillations persist, even though both their amplitude and functional\nform change drastically with integrability breaking. Striking new phenomena\naccompany loss of integrability. First, an extremely long time scale emerges in\nthe relaxation to Phase III, such that short-time numerical simulations risk\nerroneously classifying the asymptotic state. This time scale diverges near\nintegrable points. Second, an entirely new Phase IV of quasiperiodic\noscillations of $|\\Delta|$ emerges in the quantum quench phase diagrams of\nnonintegrable pairing models. As integrability techniques do not apply for the\nmodels we study, we develop the concept of asymptotic self-consistency and a\nlinear stability analysis of the asymptotic phases. With the help of these new\ntools, we determine the phase boundaries, characterize the asymptotic state,\nand clarify the physical meaning of the quantum quench phase diagrams of BCS\nsuperconductors.

However, in many real-world applications,\nsuch as commercial cloud management, manufacturing predictive maintenance, and\nportfolios performance analysis, such dependencies can be non-linear and\ntime-variant, which makes it more challenging to extract such dependencies\nthrough traditional methods such as Granger causality or clustering. In this\nwork, we present a novel deep learning model that uses multiple layers of\ncustomized gated recurrent units (GRUs) for discovering both time lagged\nbehaviors as well as inter-timeseries dependencies in the form of directed\nweighted graphs. We introduce a key component of Dual-purpose recurrent neural\nnetwork that decodes information in the temporal domain to discover lagged\ndependencies within each time series, and encodes them into a set of vectors\nwhich, collected from all component time series, form the informative inputs to\ndiscover inter-dependencies. Though the discovery of two types of dependencies\nare separated at different hierarchical levels, they are tightly connected and\njointly trained in an end-to-end manner. With this joint training, learning of\none type of dependency immediately impacts the learning of the other one,\nleading to overall accurate dependencies discovery. We empirically test our\nmodel on synthetic time series data in which the exact form of (non-linear)\ndependencies is known. We also evaluate its performance on two real-world\napplications, (i) performance monitoring data from a commercial cloud provider,\nwhich exhibit highly dynamic, non-linear, and volatile behavior and, (ii)\nsensor data from a manufacturing plant. We further show how our approach is\nable to capture these dependency behaviors via intuitive and interpretable\ndependency graphs and use them to generate highly accurate forecasts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Dec 2018 21:20:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-12"}

Since the\nnoise associated with these modulations has an infinite variance, geometric\npower is used as a measure for the noise power, and we derive an expression for\nthe geometric SNR (G-SNR) for each modulation scheme. Numerical evaluations\nindicate that for these systems the bit error rate (BER) is constant at a given\nG-SNR, similar to the relation between BER and SNR in additive Gaussian noise\nchannels. We also demonstrate that the asynchronous modulation based on two\ndistinguishable particles can achieve a BER performance close to the\nsynchronized modulation scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Dec 2018 05:41:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-12"}

The inherent ability of the human mind facilitates us to recognize\na person by exploiting various challenges such as bad illumination, occlusions,\npose variation etc. which are involved in face recognition. But it is a very\ncomplex task in nature to identify a human face by humanoid robots. The recent\nliteratures on face biometric recognition are extremely rich in its application\non structured environment for solving human identification problem. But the\napplication of face biometric on mobile robotics is limited for its inability\nto produce accurate identification in uneven circumstances. The existing face\nrecognition problem has been tackled with our proposed component based\nfragmented face recognition framework. The proposed framework uses only a\nsubset of the full face such as eyes, nose and mouth to recognize a person.\nIt's less searching cost, encouraging accuracy and ability to handle various\nchallenges of face recognition offers its applicability on humanoid robots. The\nsecond problem in face recognition is the face spoofing, in which a face\nrecognition system is not able to distinguish between a person and an imposter\n(photo/video of the genuine user). The problem will become more detrimental\nwhen robots are used as an authenticator. A depth analysis method has been\ninvestigated in our research work to test the liveness of imposters to\ndiscriminate them from the legitimate users. The implication of the previous\nearned techniques has been used with respect to criminal identification with\nNAO robot. An eyewitness can interact with NAO through a user interface. NAO\nasks several questions about the suspect, such as age, height, her/his facial\nshape and size etc., and then making a guess about her/his face.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Dec 2018 11:00:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-19"}

In this paper, emerging\nlearning-based techniques are leveraged to address crowdsensing game with\ndemand uncertainties and private information protection of MUs. Firstly, a\nnovel economic model for mobile crowdsensing is designed, which takes MUs'\nresources constraints and demand uncertainties into consideration. Secondly, an\nincentive mechanism based on Stackelberg game is provided, where the\nsensing-platform (SP) is the leader and the MUs are the followers.
