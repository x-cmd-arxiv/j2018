In this work, we aim to mitigate the\nprohibitive inferential and memory costs of operating in such large dimensional\nspaces. To sample from the high-resolution original input distribution, we\npropose using a smaller proxy distribution to learn the co-ordinates that\ncorrespond to regions of interest in the high-dimensional space. We introduce a\nnew principled variational lower bound that captures the relationship of the\nproxy distribution's posterior and the original image's co-ordinate space in a\nway that maximizes the conditional classification likelihood. We empirically\ndemonstrate on one synthetic benchmark and one real world large resolution DSLR\ncamera image dataset that our method produces comparable results with ~10x\nfaster inference and lower memory consumption than a model that utilizes the\nentire original input distribution.

In previous monocular\nunsupervised learning frameworks, only part of the photometric and geometric\nconstraints within a sequence are used as supervisory signals. This may result\nin a short baseline and overfitting. Besides, previous works generally estimate\na low resolution depth from a low resolution impute image.

This strategy\nmay generate large errors on object boundaries, as the depth of background and\nforeground are mixed to yield the high resolution depth.

Singular point is the point of maximum\ncurvature. It is determined by the normal of each fingerprint ridge, and then\nfollowing them inward towards the centre. The local ridge features known as\nminutiae is extracted using cross-number method to find ridge endings and ridge\nbifurcations.

The radius can be varied according to the accuracy depending on the\nparticular application.

Infrared and radio luminosities are\nbound by a tight correlation that is defined by the so-called q parameter. This\ninfrared-radio correlation provides the basis for the use of radio luminosity\nas a star-formation tracer. Recent stacking and survival analysis studies find\nq to be decreasing with increasing redshift. It was pointed out that a possible\ncause of the redshift trend could be the computation of rest-frame radio\nluminosity via a single power-law assumption of the star-forming galaxies'\n(SFGs) SED.To test this, we constrained the shape of the radio SED of a sample\nof HSFGs. To achieve a broad rest-frame frequency range, we combined previously\npublished VLA observations of the COSMOS field at 1.4 GHz and 3 GHz with\nunpublished GMRT observations at 325 MHz and 610 MHz by employing survival\nanalysis to account for non-detections in the GMRT maps. We selected a sample\nof HSFGs in a broad redshift range (0.3<z<4,SFR>100M0/yr) and constructed the\naverage radio SED. By fitting a broken power-law, we find that the spectral\nindex changes from $\\alpha_1=0.42\\pm0.06$ below a rest-frame frequency of 4.3\nGHz to $\\alpha_2=0.94\\pm0.06$ above 4.3 GHz. Our results are in line with\nprevious low-redshift studies of HSFGs (SFR>10M0/yr) that show the SED of HSFGs\nto differ from the SED found for normal SFGs (SFR<10M0/yr). The difference is\nmainly in a steeper spectrum around 10 GHz, which could indicate a smaller\nfraction of thermal free-free emission. Finally, we also discuss the impact of\napplying this broken power-law SED in place of a simple power-law in\nK-corrections of HSFGs and a typical radio SED for normal SFGs drawn from the\nliterature.

To date the study and development\nof the REXI approach has been limited to linearized problems on the periodic 2D\nplane. This work extends the REXI time stepping method to the linear\nshallow-water equations (SWE) on the rotating sphere, thus moving the method\none step closer to solving fully nonlinear fluid problems of geophysical\ninterest on the sphere. The rotating sphere poses particular challenges for\nfinding an efficient solver due to the zonal dependence of the Coriolis term.\nHere we present an efficient REXI solver based on spherical harmonics, showing\nthe results of: a geostrophic balance test, a comparison with alternative time\nstepping methods, an analysis of dispersion relations, indicating superior\nproperties of REXI, and finally a performance comparison on Cheyenne\nsupercomputer. Our results indicate that REXI is not only able to take larger\ntime steps, but that REXI can also be used to gain higher accuracy and\nsignificantly reduced time-to-solution compared to currently existing time\nstepping methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Dec 2018 05:12:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2019 15:51:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

The main problem with the Peaks-Over Threshold method relates to the\nselection of threshold above and below which the asymptotic results are valid\nfor large and small observations respectively. In addition, the main assumption\nleading to the asymptotic results is that the observations are independent and\nidentically distributed. However, in practice, many real life processes yield\ndata that are non-stationary and/or related to some covariate variables. As a\nresult, threshold selection gets complicated as it may depend on the\ncovariates. Strong arguments have been made against the use of constant\nthreshold as observation that is considered extreme at some covariate level may\nnot qualify as an extreme observation at another covariate level. Some authors\nhave attempted to obtain covariate dependent thresholds in different ways: the\nmost appealing one relies on quantile regression. In this paper, we propose a\ncovariate dependent threshold based on expectiles. We compare this threshold\nwith the constant and the quantile regression in a simulation study for\nestimating the tail index of the Generalised Pareto distribution. As may be\nexpected, no threshold is universally the best. However, certain general\nobservations can be made for the exponential growth data considered. Firstly,\nwe find that the expectile threshold outperforms the others when the response\nvariable has smaller to medium values. Secondly, for larger values of the\nresponse variable, the constant threshold is generally the best method. The\nthreshold selection methods are illustrated in the estimation of the tail index\nof an insurance claims data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Dec 2018 05:17:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-11"}

The evolution of the MFR is observed by the Solar Terrestrial\nRelations Observatory (STEREO) and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) from\nmultiple viewpoints. From STEREO's perspective, the MFR starts to rise slowly\nabove the limb five hours before it erupts as a halo CME on 2012 June 14. In\nSDO observations, conjugate dimmings develop on the disk, simultaneously with\nthe gradual expansion of the MFR, suggesting that the dimmings map the MFR's\nfeet. The evolution comprises a two-stage gradual expansion followed by another\nstage of rapid acceleration/eruption. Quantitative measurements indicate that\nmagnetic twist of the MFR increases from 1.0 +/- 0.5 to 2.0 +/- 0.5 turns\nduring the five-hour expansion, and further increases to about 4.0 turns per AU\nwhen detected as a magnetic cloud at 1 AU two day later.

The wave function of a\nquantum computer is split into several subwaves after the wave division\noperation. Then different unitary operations are performed on different\nsubwaves in parallel. A quantum wave combiner combines the subwaves into a\nfinal wave function, so that a linear combination of the unitaries are\nperformed on the final state.

Various cellular level mechanisms influence the network dynamics\nand structure the macroscopic firing patterns. Key question is to identify the\nbiophysical neuronal and synaptic properties that permit such motifs to arise\nand how the different coherence states determine the communication between the\nneural circuits. We analyse the emergence of phase locking within\nbidirectionally delayed-coupled spiking circuits showing global gamma band\noscillations. We consider both the interneuronal (ING) and the\npyramidal-interneuronal (PING) gamma rhythms and the inter coupling targeting\nthe pyramidal or the inhibitory interneurons. Using a mean-field approach\ntogether with an exact reduction method, we break down each spiking network\ninto a low dimensional nonlinear system and derive the macroscopic phase\nresetting-curves (mPRCs) that determine how the phase of the global oscillation\nresponds to incoming perturbations. Depending on the type of gamma oscillation,\nwe show that incoming excitatory inputs can either only speed up the\noscillation (phase advance; type I PRC) or induce both an advance and a delay\nthe macroscopic oscillation (phase delay; type II PRC). From there we determine\nthe structure of macroscopic coherence states (phase locking) of two weakly\nsynaptically-coupled networks. To do so we derive a phase equation for the\ncoupled system which links the synaptic mechanisms to the coherence state of\nthe system. We show that the transmission delay is a necessary condition for\nsymmetry breaking, i.e. a non-symmetric phase lag between the macroscopic\noscillations, potentially giving an explanation to the experimentally observed\nvariety of gamma phase-locking modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Dec 2018 10:26:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-19"}

Neural network patching is an approach\nfor adapting neural network models to handle concept drift in nonstationary\nenvironments. Instead of creating or updating the existing network to\naccommodate concept drift, neural network patching leverages the inner layers\nof the network as well as its output to learn a patch that enhances the\nclassification and corrects errors caused by the drift. It learns (i) a\npredictor that estimates whether the original network will misclassify an\ninstance, and (ii) a patching network that fixes the misclassification. Neural\nnetwork patching is based on the idea that the original network can still\nclassify a majority of instances well, and that the inner feature\nrepresentations encoded in the deep network aid the classifier to cope with\nunseen or changed inputs. In order to apply this kind of patching, we evaluate\ndifferent engagement layers and patch architectures in this report, and find a\nset of generally applicable heuristics, which aid in parametrizing the patching\nprocedure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Dec 2018 12:17:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Jan 2019 10:02:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-17"}

In order to take account into\nthe heavy flavour, an extra pair of heavy-flavoured branes separated from the\nother flavour branes with a heavy-light open string is embedded into the bulk.\nDue to the finite separation of the flavour branes, the heavy-light string\ncreates massive multiplets which could be identified as the heavy-light meson\nfields in this model. As the baryon brane on the other hand could be\nequivalently described by the instanton configuration on the flavour brane, we\nsolve the equations of motion for the heavy-light fields with the\nBelavin-Polyakov-Schwarz-Tyupkin (BPST) instanton solution for the $N_{f}=2$\nflavoured gauge fields.

In\nthe polar region, ice sheets can be several kilometres long and subjected to\nthe effects of ocean waves. As its thickness to length ratio is very small, the\nwave response of such a large ice sheet, known as its hydroelastic response, is\ndominated by an elastic deformation rather than rigid body motions. In the past\n25 years, sea ice hydroelasticity has been widely studied by theoretical\nmodels; however, recent experiments indicate that the ideal assumptions used\nfor these theoretical models can cause considerable inaccuracies.

To solve the problem, we argue that one should\nmake use of the short-range contextual information, such as the presence of\nsome nearby organs (if any), to roughly estimate the target vertebrae; due to\nthe unique anatomic structure of the spine column, vertebrae have fixed\nsequential order which provides the important long-range contextual information\nto further calibrate the results.\n  We propose a robust and efficient vertebrae identification and localization\nsystem that can inherently learn to incorporate both the short-range and\nlong-range contextual information in a supervised manner.

Formally, a\n$(d,c)$-cycle cover of a graph $G$ is a collection of cycles in $G$ in which\neach cycle is of length at most $d$ and each edge participates in at least one\ncycle and at most $c$ cycles.

Deep neural networks have shown to be very\npowerful to learn the non-linear patterns in the data. While a deep learning\napproach attempts to learn complex pattern related to the presence of AF in the\nECG, they can benefit from knowing which parts of the signal is more important\nto focus during learning. In this paper, we introduce a two-channel deep neural\nnetwork to more accurately detect AF presented in the ECG signal. The first\nchannel takes in a preprocessed ECG signal and automatically learns where to\nattend for detection of AF. The second channel simultaneously takes in the\npreprocessed ECG signal to consider all features of entire signals.

For that purpose we will consider the change of the topology of the\nspatial component seen as compact 3-manifold. We analyzed the topology change\nby using Morse theory and handle body decomposition of manifolds. For the\ngeneral case of a topology change of a $n-$manifold, we are forced to introduce\na scalar field with quadratic potential or double well potential. Unfortunately\nthese cases are ruled out by the CMB results of the Planck misssion. In case of\n3-manifolds there is another possibility which uses deep results in\ndifferential topology of 4-manifolds. With the help of these results we will\nshow that in case of a fixed homology of the 3-manifolds one will obtain a\nscalar field potential which is conformally equivalent to the Starobinsky\nmodel. The free parameter of the Starobinsky model can be expressed by the\ntopological invariants of the 3-manifold. Furthermore we are able to express\nthe number of e-folds as well as the energy and length scale by the\nChern-Simons invariant of the final 3-manifold.
