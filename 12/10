However, it is a\nchallenge to build an automatic contouring algorithm because ICE is noisy and\nprovides only a limited 2D view of the 3D anatomy. This work provides the first\nautomatic solution to segment the left atrium and the pulmonary veins from ICE.\nIn this solution, we demonstrate the benefit of building a cross-modality\nframework that can leverage a database of diagnostic images to supplement the\nless available interventional images. To this end, we develop a novel deep\nneural network approach that uses the (i) 3D geometrical information provided\nby a position sensor embedded in the ICE catheter and the (ii) 3D image\nappearance information from a set of computed tomography cardiac volumes. We\nevaluate the proposed approach over 11,000 ICE images collected from 150\nclinical patients.

We show that\nunlike most other optimization paradigms, it is stable in the sense that\nneutral bit values are sampled with probability close to $1/2$ for a long time.\nThis is generally a desirable property, however, it makes it harder to find the\noptima for decision variables with small influence on the objective function.\nThis can result in an optimization time exponential in the dimension when\noptimizing simple symmetric functions like OneMax. On the positive side, BDE\nquickly detects and optimizes the most important decision variables. For\nexample, dominant bits converge to the optimal value in time logarithmic in the\npopulation size.

Applied to 55\nyears of data on countries' exports, PriSDA finds that what most distinguishes\ncountries' export baskets is their diversity, with extra weight assigned to\nmore sophisticated products. The weights are consistent with previous measures\nof product complexity in the literature. The second dimension of variation is a\nproficiency in machinery relative to agriculture.

Moreover, economies\nappear to become richer after they diversify (i.e., diversity precedes growth).\nThe model predicts that middle-income countries with diverse export baskets\nwill grow the fastest in the coming decades, and that countries will converge\nonto intermediate levels of income and specialization.

According to the no-hair theorem, every astrophysical black\nhole, including supermassive black holes, is characterized by at most three\nclassical, externally observable parameters - mass, spin, and the electric\ncharge. While the mass and the spin have routinely been measured by several\nmethods, the electric charge has usually been neglected, based on the arguments\nof efficient discharge in astrophysical plasmas. From a theoretical point of\nview, the black hole can attain charge due to the mass imbalance between\nprotons and electrons in fully ionized plasmas, which yields about $\\sim\n10^8\\,{\\rm C}$ for Sgr A*. The second, induction mechanism concerns rotating\nKerr black holes embedded in an external magnetic field, which leads to\nelectric field generation due to the twisting of magnetic field lines. This\nelectric field can be associated with the induced Wald charge, for which we\ncalculate the upper limit of $\\sim 10^{15}\\,{\\rm C}$ for Sgr A*.

The $q$-means algorithm has\nconvergence and precision guarantees similar to $k$-means, and it outputs with\nhigh probability a good approximation of the $k$ cluster centroids like the\nclassical algorithm.

A representative task is Visual Question\nAnswering where large diagnostic datasets have been proposed to test a system's\ncapability of answering questions about images. The training data is often\naccompanied by annotations of individual object properties and spatial\nlocations. In this work, we take a step towards integrating this additional\nprivileged information in the form of spatial knowledge to aid in visual\nreasoning. We propose a framework that combines recent advances in knowledge\ndistillation (teacher-student framework), relational reasoning and\nprobabilistic logical languages to incorporate such knowledge in existing\nneural networks for the task of Visual Question Answering.

However, there is very little direct\nverification of the theory and its assumptions from simulations of microscopic\nmodels. In this paper, we compare the results and assumptions of the\nhydrodynamic theory with results from large scale event driven molecular\ndynamics simulations of a hard sphere gas in three dimensions. We find that the\npredictions for the radial distribution of the thermodynamic quantities do not\nmatch well with the numerical data. We improve the theory by replacing the\nideal gas law with a more realistic virial equation of state for the hard\nsphere gas. While this improves the theoretical predictions, we show that they\nstill fail to describe the data well. To understand the reasons for this\ndiscrepancy, the different assumptions of the hydrodynamic theory are tested\nwithin the simulations. A key assumption of the theory is the existence of a\nlocal equation of state. We validate this assumption by showing that the local\npressure, temperature and density obey the equation of state for a hard sphere\ngas. However, the probability distribution of the velocity fluctuations has\nnon-gaussian tails, especially away from the shock front, showing that the\nassumption of local equilibrium is violated. This, along with neglect of heat\nconduction, could be the possible reasons for the mismatch between theory and\nsimulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Dec 2018 05:58:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-11"}

This inverse problem is formulated as\nthe minimization of the modified error in constitutive equation (MECE), an\nenergy-based cost functional defined as an weighted additive combination\n$\\mathcal{E}+\\kappa\\mathcal{D}$ of the error in constitutive equation (ECE)\n$\\mathcal{E}$, expressed using an energy seminorm, and a quadratic error term\n$\\mathcal{D}$ incorporating the kinematical measurements. MECE-based\nidentification are known from existing computational evidence to enjoy\nattractive properties such as improved convexity, robustness to resonant\nfrequencies, and tolerance to incompletely specified boundary conditions (BCs).\nThe main goal of this work is to develop theoretical foundations, in a\ncontinuous setting, allowing to explain and justify some of the aforementioned\nbeneficial properties, in particular addressing the general case where BCs may\nbe underspecified. A specific feature of MECE formulations is that forward and\nadjoint solutions are governed by a fully coupled system, whose mathematical\nproperties play a fundamental role in the qualitative and computational aspects\nof MECE minimization. We prove that this system has a unique and stable\nsolution at any frequency, provided data is abundant enough (in a sense made\nprecise therein) to at least compensate for any missing information on BCs. As\na result, our formulation leads in such situations to a well-defined solution\neven though the relevant forward problem is not \\emph{a priori} clearly\ndefined. This result has practical implications such as applicability of MECE\nto partial interior data (with important practical applications including\nultrasound elastography), convergence of finite element discretizations and\ndifferentiability of the reduced MECE functional. In addition, we establish\nthat usual least squares and pure ECE formulations are limiting cases of MECE\nformulations for small and large values of $\\kappa$, respectively. For the\nlatter case, which corresponds to exact enforcement of kinematic data, we\nfurthermore show that the reduced MECE Hessian is asymptotically positive for\nany parameter perturbation supported on the measurement region, thereby\ncorroborating existing computational evidence on convexity improvement brought\nby MECE functionals.

For each $\\varepsilon$ fixed, the set of initial\nconditions of the orbits that yield the diffusion process has positive Lebesgue\nmeasure, and in the limit the measure of these sets approaches zero. Moreover,\nwe can obtain any desired values of the drift and variance for the limiting\nBrownian motion, for appropriate sets of initial conditions. A key feature of\nour topological method is that it can be implemented in computer assisted\nproofs.

They show sometimes a very large extension and a\npreferential direction. Brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) are believed to grow\nthrough the accretion of many small galaxies, and their structural properties\nare expected to vary with redshift. In some cases BCGs show an orientation\ncomparable to that of the cluster to which they belong. We analyse the\nmorphological properties of 38 BCGs from the DAFT/FADA and CLASH surveys and\ncompare the position angles of their major axes to the direction of the cluster\nelongation at Mpc scale. The morphological properties of the BCGs were studied\nby applying the GALFIT software to HST images and fitting the light\ndistribution with one or two Sersic laws, or with a Nuker plus a Sersic law.\nThe cluster elongations were estimated by computing density maps of red\nsequence galaxies. The analysis of the 38 BCGs shows that in 11 cases a single\nSersic law is sufficient to account for the surface brightness, while for all\nthe other clusters two laws are necessary. For the outer Sersic component, the\neffective radius increases with decreasing redshift, and the effective surface\nbrightness decreases with effective radius, following the Kormendy law. An\nagreement between the major axis of the BCG and the cluster elongation at large\nscale within +-30 deg is found for 12 clusters out of the 21 for which both PAs\ncan be defined. The variation with redshift of the effective radius of the\nouter Sersic component agrees with the growing of BCGs by accretion of smaller\ngalaxies from z=0.9 to 0.2. The directions of the elongations of BCGs and of\ntheir host clusters and large scale structures agree for 12 objects out of 21,\nimplying that a larger sample is necessary to reach more definite conclusions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Dec 2018 08:42:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Dec 2018 21:43:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-06"}

Changes in\nspectral line profiles are inverted to a stellar surface temperature map using\nour $i$Map code. The long-term photometric record is employed to compare our\nmap with previously published maps. Four cool spots were reconstructed, but no\npolar spot was seen. The temperature difference to the photosphere of the spots\nis between 990 and 280K. Two spots are reconstructed with a typical solar\nmorphology with an umbra and a penumbra. For the one isolated and relatively\nround spot (A), we determine an umbral temperature of 990K and a penumbral\ntemperature of 180K below photospheric temperature. The umbra to photosphere\nintensity ratio of EK Dra is approximately only half of that of a comparison\nsunspot. A test inversion from degraded line profiles showed that the higher\nspectral resolution of PEPSI reconstructs the surface with a temperature\ndifference that is on average 10% higher than before and with smaller surface\nareas by 10-20%. PEPSI is therefore better suited to detecting and\ncharacterising temperature inhomogeneities. With ten more years of photometry,\nwe also refine the spot cycle period of EK Dra to 8.9$\\pm$0.2 years with a\ncontinuing long-term fading trend. The temperature morphology of spot A so far\nappears to show the best evidence for the existence of a solar-like penumbra\nfor a starspot. We emphasise that it is more the non-capture of the true umbral\ncontrast rather than the detection of the weak penumbra that is the limiting\nfactor. The relatively small line broadening of EK Dra, together with the only\nmoderately high spectral resolutions previously available, appear to be the\nmain contributors to the lower-than-expected spot contrasts when comparing to\nthe Sun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Dec 2018 08:52:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-11"}

This species is the next step in chemical complexity\nafter the simplest member of esters (methyl formate, CH$_{3}$OCHO). The\nmechanisms leading to its formation are still poorly known. We have used high\nangular resolution ($\\sim$ 1.$^{\\prime\\prime}$5) ALMA observations covering a\nlarge bandwidth from 214 to 247 GHz. We have detected 82 unblended lines of\nC$_{2}$H$_{5}$OCHO (49 and 33 of the trans and gauche conformers,\nrespectively). The line images showed that C$_{2}$H$_{5}$OCHO arises mainly\nfrom the compact ridge and the hot core-southwest regions. The derived\nrotational temperatures and column densities are 122 $\\pm$ 34 K, (0.9 $\\pm$\n0.3) $\\times$ 10$^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$ for the hot core-SW, and 103 $\\pm$ 13 K, (0.6\n$\\pm$ 0.3) $\\times$ 10$^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$ for the compact ridge. The comparison\nof spatial distribution and abundance ratios with chemically related molecules\n(methyl formate, ethanol and formic acid) indicates that C$_{2}$H$_{5}$OCHO is\nlikely formed on the surface of dust grains by addition of CH$_{3}$ to\nfunctional-group radicals (CH$_{2}$OCHO) derived from methyl formate\n(CH$_{3}$OCHO).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Dec 2018 09:55:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-13"}

In\nthe present investigation, a set of wave/mean-flow interaction equations is\nderived that governs the coupled dynamics of a standing acoustic wave mode of\ncharacteristic (small) amplitude {\\epsilon} and the streaming flow it drives in\na thin channel with walls maintained at differing temperatures. Unlike\nclassical Rayleigh streaming, the resulting mean flow arises at O({\\epsilon})\nrather than at O({\\epsilon^2}). Consequently, fully two-way coupling between\nthe waves and the mean flow is possible: the streaming is sufficiently strong\nto induce O(1) rearrangements of the imposed background temperature and density\nfields, which modifies the spatial structure and frequency of the acoustic mode\non the streaming time scale. A novel Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin-Jeffreys\nanalysis is developed to average over the fast wave dynamics, enabling the\ncoupled system to be integrated strictly on the slow time scale of the\nstreaming flow. Analytical solutions of the reduced system are derived for weak\nwave forcing and are shown to reproduce results from prior direct numerical\nsimulations (DNS) of the compressible Navier Stokes and heat equations with\nremarkable accuracy.

Nonthermal processes are treated; the magnetar-power deposition\nprofile is prescribed; dynamical effects are ignored. In this context, the main\ninfluence of the magnetar power is to boost the internal energy of the ejecta\non week-long time scales, enhancing the ejecta temperature and ionization,\nshifting the spectral energy distribution to the near-UV (even for the adopted\nsolar metallicity), creating blue optical colors.

We demonstrate that,\nafter the introduction of counterterms, the remainder is finite in four\ndimensions. In addition, we find in these cases that the complete singular\ndependence of the integrals can be obtained simply by analytically integrating\nthe counterterms. Finally, we observe that our subtraction method can be also\nuseful in order to extract in a simple way the asymptotic behavior of Feynman\namplitudes in the limit of small mass parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Dec 2018 12:27:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

However, unlike for images, in 3D there\nis no canonical representation which is both computationally and memory\nefficient yet allows for representing high-resolution geometry of arbitrary\ntopology. Many of the state-of-the-art learning-based 3D reconstruction\napproaches can hence only represent very coarse 3D geometry or are limited to a\nrestricted domain. In this paper, we propose Occupancy Networks, a new\nrepresentation for learning-based 3D reconstruction methods. Occupancy networks\nimplicitly represent the 3D surface as the continuous decision boundary of a\ndeep neural network classifier. In contrast to existing approaches, our\nrepresentation encodes a description of the 3D output at infinite resolution\nwithout excessive memory footprint. We validate that our representation can\nefficiently encode 3D structure and can be inferred from various kinds of\ninput. Our experiments demonstrate competitive results, both qualitatively and\nquantitatively, for the challenging tasks of 3D reconstruction from single\nimages, noisy point clouds and coarse discrete voxel grids.

The field equations are studied\nin two ways. The method of group invariant transformations, i.e., symmetries of\ndifferential equations apply in order to constraint the free functions of the\ntheory and determine conservation laws for the gravitational field equations.\nThe second method that we apply for the study of the evolution of the field\nequations is the stability analysis of equilibrium points. Particularly, we\nfind solutions with $w_{\\text{tot}}=-1$, and we study their stability by means\nof the Center Manifold Theorem. We show this solution is an attractor in the\ndilatonic frame but it is an intermediate accelerated solution $a \\simeq e^{A\nt^p}, p:=\\frac{2}{2+l}, \\quad \\frac{32}{57+6 \\omega_0}<p<\\frac{2}{3},\n\\;\\text{as}\\; t\\rightarrow \\infty$, and not de Sitter solution.

The major\ndifficulty being that of frequent handovers and the corresponding handover\nlosses, which significantly depend upon the speed of the user. It was shown\npreviously that the optimal cell size increases with speed. Thus, in scenarios\nwith diverse users (speeds spanning over large ranges), it would be inefficient\nto serve all users using common cell radius and it is practically infeasible to\ndesign different cell sizes for different speeds. Alternatively, we propose to\nallocate power to a user based on its speed, e.g., higher power virtually\nincreases the cell size. We solve well known Hamiltonian Jacobi equations under\ncertain assumptions to obtain a power law, optimal for load factor and busy\nprobability, for any given average power constraint and cell size. The optimal\npower control turns out to be linear in speed. We build a system level\nsimulator for small cell network, using elaborate Monte-Carlo simulations, and\nshow that the performance of the system improves significantly with linear\npower law. The power law is tested even for the cases, for which the system\ndoes not satisfy the assumptions required by the theory. For example, the\nlinear power law has significant improvement in comparison with the 'equal\npower' system, even in presence of time varying and random interference. We\nobserve good improvement in almost all cases with improvements up to 89\\% for\ncertain configurations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Dec 2018 15:12:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-27"}

BB-FCN follows a coarse-to-fine cascaded pipeline, which\nconsists of a backbone network for roughly detecting the locations of all\nfacial landmarks and one branch network for each type of detected landmark for\nfurther refining their locations. Furthermore, to facilitate the facial\nlandmark localization under unconstrained settings, we propose a large-scale\nbenchmark named SYSU16K, which contains 16000 faces with large variations in\npose, expression, illumination and resolution. Extensive experimental\nevaluations demonstrate that our proposed BB-FCN can significantly outperform\nthe state-of-the-art under both constrained (i.e., within detected facial\nregions only) and unconstrained settings. We further confirm that high-quality\nfacial landmarks localized with our proposed network can also improve the\nprecision and recall of face detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Dec 2018 15:50:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-11"}

During 6\nhours per orbit, the satellites will fly in a precise formation, constituting a\ngiant externally occulted coronagraph. Large distance between the external\nocculter and the primary objective will allow observations of the white-light\nsolar corona starting from extremely low heights 1.1RSun. Aims: To analyze\ninfluence of optical ghost images formed inside the telescope and develop an\nalgorithm for their removal. Methods: We implement the optical layout of\nASPIICS in Zemax and study the ghost behaviour in sequential and non-sequential\nregimes. We identify sources of the ghost contributions and analyze their\ngeometrical behaviour. Finally we develop a mathematical model and software to\ncalculate ghost images for any given input image.

This upsurge of research has been prompted by the modified\nuncertainty relation brought about in the framework of string theory. In\ngeneral, the implementation of minimum length in QM can be done either by\nmodification of position and momentum operators or by restriction of their\ndomains. In the former case we have the so called soccer-ball problem when the\nnaive classical limit appears to be drastically different from the usual one.\nStarting with the latter possibility, an alternative approach was suggested in\nthe form of a band-limited QM. However, applying momentum cutoff to the\nwave-function, one faces the problem of incompatibility with the\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation. One can overcome this problem in a natural fashion by\nappropriately modifying Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation. But incompatibility takes\nplace for boundary conditions as well. Such wave-function cannot have any more\na finite support in the coordinate space as it simply follows from the\nPaley-Wiener theorem. Treating, for instance, the simplest quantum-mechanical\nproblem of a particle in an infinite potential well, one can no longer impose\nbox boundary conditions. In such cases, further modification of the theory is\nin order. We propose a non-local modification of QM, which has close ties to\nthe band-limited QM, but does not require a hard momentum cutoff. In the\nframework of this model, one can easily work out the corrections to various\nprocesses and discuss further the semi-classical limit of the theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Dec 2018 14:40:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Aug 2019 14:30:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 17 Oct 2020 04:51:14 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2021 14:53:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-29"}

Furthermore, this paper contributes to\nhuman-environment interaction research, where a field study to understand the\ninfluence of environmental features such as varying sound level, illuminance,\nfield-of-view, or environmental conditions on humans' perception was proposed.\nIn the study, participants of various demographic backgrounds walked through an\nurban environment in Zurich, Switzerland while wearing physiological and\nenvironmental sensors. Apart from signal processing, four machine learning\ntechniques, classification, fuzzy rule-based inference, feature selection, and\nclustering, were applied to discover relevant patterns and relationship between\nthe participants' physiological responses and environmental conditions. The\npredictive models with high accuracies indicate that the change in the\nfield-of-view corresponds to increased participant arousal.

We show that electric-magnetic\nduality reported for dyonic solutions with Maxwell field is omitted in case of\nBorn-Infeld generalization. We also confirm that generalization to nonlinear\nfield provides the possibility of canceling the effects of cosmological\nconstant. This is done for nonlinearity parameter with $10^{-33}\\mbox{ eV}^{2}$\norder of magnitude which is high nonlinearity regime. In addition, we show that\nfor small electric/magnetic charge and high nonlinearity regime, black holes\nwould develop critical behavior and several phases. In contrast, for highly\ncharged case and Maxwell limits (small nonlinearity), black holes have one\nthermal stable phase. We also find that the pressure of the cold black holes is\nbounded by some constraints on its volume while hot black holes' pressure has\nphysical behavior for any volume. In addition, we report on possibility of\nexistences of triple point and reentrant of phase transition in thermodynamics\nof these black holes. Finally, We show that if electric and magnetic charges\nare identical, the behavior of our solutions would be Maxwell like (independent\nof nonlinear parameter and field). In other words, nonlinearity of\nelectromagnetic field becomes evident only when these black holes are charged\nmagnetically and electrically different.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Dec 2018 10:45:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2019 14:57:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-15"}

At the macro-level, we\ndiscuss and organize use cases from 159 selected papers into nine sectors\nrecognized as crucial for sustainable and smart urban future. At the\nmicro-level, we identify a component-based framework and analyze the design and\nprototypes of blockchain systems studied in a subset of 71 papers.
