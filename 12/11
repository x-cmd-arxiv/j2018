To\naddress these challenges, we propose a Bayesian framework to select the most\nlikely physics-based models of EFs in real-time, from a pool of numerical\nsolutions generated offline as a function of the uncertain parameters.\nSpecifically, we focus on turbulent flow fields and utilize Gaussian processes\n(GPs) to construct statistical models for them, using the pool of numerical\nsolutions to inform their prior mean. To incorporate flow measurements into\nthese GPs, we control a custom-built mobile robot through a sequence of\nwaypoints that maximize the information content of the measurements. We\nexperimentally demonstrate that our proposed framework constructs a posterior\ndistribution of the flow field that better approximates the real flow compared\nto the prior numerical solutions and purely data-driven methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Dec 2018 16:02:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Feb 2019 23:22:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 2020 03:39:45 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2021 02:14:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-15"}

It is based on identification of a parameter\nwhich is uniformly small on wide time intervals: the occupation of the virtual\ncloud of quanta. By \"virtual\" we denote those bath excitations which were\nemitted by the system, but eventually will be reabsorbed before any measurement\nof the bath state. A favourable property of the virtual cloud is that the\nnumber of its quanta is expected to saturate on long times, since physically\nthis cloud is a (retarded) polarization of the bath around the system.\nTherefore, the joint state of open system and of virtual cloud (the dressed\nstate) can be accurately represented in a truncated basis of Fock states, on a\nwide time scale. At the same time, there can be arbitrarily large number of\nobservable quanta, especially if the open system is under driving. However, by\nemploying a Monte Carlo sampling of the measurement outcomes of the bath, we\ncan simulate the dynamics of the observable quantum field. In this work we\nconsider the measurement with respect to the coherent states, which yields the\nHusimi function as the positive (quasi)probability distribution of the\noutcomes. The evolution of dressed state which corresponds to a particular\nfixed outcome is called the dressed qauntum trajectory. Therefore, the Monte\nCarlo sampling of these trajectories yields a stochastic simulation method with\npromising convergence properties on wide time scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Dec 2018 16:54:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-05"}

The \"ultrafast flow\" is result of using\nunrealistic geometrical model with close packed hole-free micrometer sized GO\nflakes providing only 0.1 % of area in each layer available for permeation. The\ndata by Q.Yang et all demonstrate that at least 3-5 % of total layer area are\navailable for permeation in real GO membranes due to holes between irregularly\nshaped flakes. At least 2-3 percent of area also needs to be added to the\npermeation cross section due to holes and cracks in GO flakes, especially\nabundant due to prolonged sonication of dispersions. Permeation of solutions\nmostly through pinholes penetrating tens of GO layers suggests that \"graphene\ncapillaries\" are not required to explain water flow across the membrane.

Manual\nsegmentation and regional myocardial blood flow (MBF) were available for\ncomparison. We consider two global uncertainty measures, named Dice Uncertainty\nand MCD Uncertainty, which were calculated with and without the use of manual\nsegmentation, respectively. Tversky loss function with a hyperparameter $\\beta$\nwas used to adapt the model to a specific false positive vs. false negative\ntradeoff.\n  RESULTS: The MCD U-Net achieved Dice coefficient of mean(std) = 0.91(0.04) on\nthe test set.

The resulting distribution function treats the\nrotation or gyration of spherical particles as an independent classical\nvariable, deviating from the quantum mechanical treatment of molecular rotation\nfound in the Wang Chang-Uhlenbeck equation. The Boltzmann-Curtiss equation,\ntherefore, does not treat different rotational motions as separate molecular\nspecies. The first-order distribution function yields momentum equations for\nthe translational velocity and gyration that match the form of the governing\nequations of morphing continuum theory (MCT), a theory derived from the\napproach of rational continuum thermomechanics. The contribution of the local\nrotation to the Cauchy stress and the viscous diffusion are found to be\nproportional to an identical expression based off the relaxation time, number\ndensity, and equilibrium temperature of the fluid. When gyration is equated to\nthe macroscopic angular velocity, the kinetic description reduces to the\nfirst-order approximation for a classical monatomic gas, and the governing\nequations match the form of the Navier--Stokes equations. The relaxation time\nused for this approximation is shown to be more complex due to the additional\nvariable of local rotation. The approach of De Groot and Mazur is invoked to\ngive an initial approximation for the relaxation of the gyration. The\nincorporation of this relaxation time, and other physical parameters, into the\ncoefficients of the governing equations provides a more in-depth physical\ntreatment of the new terms in the MCT equations, allowing experimenters to test\nthese expressions and get a better understanding of new coefficients in MCT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Dec 2018 18:42:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-12"}

Its mass is suppressed by the\nthird power of the warp factor of a strongly warped region (Klebanov-Strassler\nthroat), suggesting the name thraxion. Our observation is based on the generic\npresence of several throats sharing the same 2-cycle. This cycle shrinks to\nzero volume at the end of each throat. It is hence trivial in homology and the\ncorresponding $C_2$ axion is massive. However, the mass is warping-suppressed\nsince, if one were to cut off the strongly warped regions, a proper 2-cycle\nwould re-emerge. Since the kinetic term of the axion is dominated in the UV, an\neven stronger, quadratic mass suppression results. Moreover, if the axion is\nexcited, the angular modes of the throats backreact. This gives our effective\n$C_2$ axion a finite monodromy and flattens its potential even further.\nEventually, the mass turns out to scale as the third power of the warp factor.\nWe briefly discuss possible implications for phenomenology and potential\nviolations of the Weak Gravity Conjecture for axions.

In the philosophical\nand parliamentary cases, the model parameters that describe this balance\nconverge under coarse-graining to limit regions that demonstrate the emergence\nof large-scale structure, a result which is robust to translation between\nlanguages. Meanwhile, we find that the political forum we consider on Reddit\nexhibits a debate-like pattern, while communities dedicated to the discussion\nof science and news show much less temporal order, and may make use of the\nemergent, tree-like topology of comment replies to structure their epistemic\nexplorations.

Properly accounting\nfor these errors has been largely ignored to date. We present a new method to\nreconstruct maximum a posteriori (MAP) convergence maps by formulating an\nunconstrained Bayesian inference problem with Laplace-type l1-norm\nsparsity-promoting priors, which we solve via convex optimization. Approaching\nmass-mapping in this manner allows us to exploit recent developments in\nprobability concentration theory to infer theoretically conservative\nuncertainties for our MAP reconstructions, without relying on assumptions of\nGaussianity. For the first time these methods allow us to perform hypothesis\ntesting of structure, from which it is possible to distinguish between physical\nobjects and artifacts of the reconstruction. Here we present this new\nformalism, demonstrate the method on simulations, before applying the developed\nformalism to two observational datasets of the Abel-520 cluster. Initial\nreconstructions of the Abel-520 catalogs reported the detection of an anomalous\n'dark core' -- an over dense region with no optical counterpart -- which was\ntaken to be evidence for self-interacting dark-matter. In our Bayesian\nframework it is found that neither Abel-520 dataset can conclusively determine\nthe physicality of such dark cores at 99% confidence. However, in both cases\nthe recovered MAP estimators are consistent with both sets of data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Dec 2018 19:00:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 15 May 2021 16:19:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-16"}

The\ndominant contribution comes from the radio core but significant X-ray emission\nis detected at larger angular separations from it, surrounding both radio jets\nand lobes. According to a scenario in which the extended X-ray emission is due\nto a plasma collisionally heated by jet-driven shocks and not magnetically\ndominated, we estimated its temperature to be ~0.8 keV.

No dominant architecture emerges\nfrom this sample; instead, remarkably diverse morphologies are observed.\nAnnular substructures can occur at virtually any radius where millimeter\ncontinuum emission is detected and range in widths from a few au to tens of au.\nIntensity ratios between gaps and adjacent rings range from near-unity to just\na few percent. In a minority of cases, annular substructures co-exist with\nother types of substructures, including spiral arms (3/18) and crescent-like\nazimuthal asymmetries (2/18). No clear trend is observed between the positions\nof the substructures and stellar host properties. In particular, the absence of\nan obvious association with stellar host luminosity (and hence the disk thermal\nstructure) suggests that substructures do not occur preferentially near major\nmolecular snowlines.

Utilizing a\nzero-mean-flow air turbulence chamber, we drop size-selected solid particles\nand study their dynamics with particle imaging and tracking velocimetry at\nmultiple resolutions. The carrier flow is simultaneously measured by particle\nimage velocimetry of suspended tracers, allowing the characterization of the\ninterplay between both the dispersed and continuous phases. The turbulence\nReynolds number based on the Taylor microscale ranges from $Re_{\\lambda}\\approx\n200$ - $500$, while the particle Stokes number based on the Kolmogorov scale\nvaries between $St_{\\eta} = O(1)$ and $O(10)$. Clustering is confirmed to be\nmost intense for $St_{\\eta} \\approx 1$, but it extends over larger scales for\nheavier particles. Individual clusters form a hierarchy of self-similar,\nfractal-like objects, preferentially aligned with gravity and sizes that can\nreach the integral scale of the turbulence. Remarkably, the settling velocity\nof $St_{\\eta} \\approx 1$ particles can be several times larger than the\nstill-air terminal velocity, and the clusters can fall even faster. This is\ncaused by downward fluid fluctuations preferentially sweeping the particles,\nand we propose that this mechanism is influenced by both large and small scales\nof the turbulence. The particle-fluid slip velocities show large variance, and\nboth the instantaneous particle Reynolds number and drag coefficient can\ngreatly differ from their nominal values. Finally, for sufficient loadings, the\nparticles generally augment the small-scale fluid velocity fluctuations, which\nhowever may account for a limited fraction of the turbulent kinetic energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Dec 2018 19:47:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

Long ago the problematic\naspect of measures in the space of fields was overcome with the introduction of\nvolume elements in Probability Space, leading to stochastic formulations. More\nrecently Cartier and DeWitt-Morette focused on the definition of a proper\nintegration measure and established a rigorous mathematical formulation of\nfunctional integration. Their central observation relates to the distributional\nnature of fields, for it leads to the identification of distribution\nfunctionals with Schwartz space test functions as density measures. This is\njust the mathematical content of the Taylor-Lagrange Scheme developed by the\nauthors in a recent past. In this scheme fields are living in metric\nSchwartz-Sobolev spaces, subject to open coverings with subordinate\npartition-of-unity test functions. In effect these PU, through the convolution\noperation, lead to smooth field functions on an extended Schwartz space. In\nthis way the basic assumption of differential geometry -- that fields live on\ndifferentiable manifolds -- is validated. Next it is shown that convolution in\nthe theory of distributions leads to a sound definition of Laplace-Stieltjes\ntransforms , stemming from the existence of an isometry invariant Hausdorff\nmeasure in the space of fields. Turning to gauge theories the construction of\nsmooth vector fields on a curved manifold is established, as required for\ndifferentiable vector fibre bundles. The proper choice of a connection further\nseparates in the functional Hausdorff integration measure a finite Gaussian\nintegration over the gauge parameter which factors out and plays no physical\nrole.

The treatment effect evolves during this period which\nprovides crucial insights into the treatment response and the long-term\neffects. Many conventional methods for estimating treatment effects are limited\nto the i.i.d. setting and are not suited for inferring the time dynamics of the\ntreatment effect. The time series encountered in these settings are highly\ninformative but often nonstationary due to the changing effects of treatment.\nThis increases the difficulty, since stationarity, a common assumption in time\nseries analysis, cannot be reasonably assumed. Another challenge is the\nheterogeneity of the treatment effect when the treatment affects units\ndifferently. The task of estimating heterogeneous treatment effects from\nnonstationary and, in particular, interventional time series is highly relevant\nbut has remained unexplored yet.

Causal Transfer\ndoes not assume the data to be stationary and can be applied to randomized\ntrials and observational studies in which treatment is confounded. Causal\nTransfer adjusts the effect for possible confounders and transfers the learned\neffect to other time series and, thereby, estimates various forms of treatment\neffects, such as the average treatment effect (ATE) or the conditional average\ntreatment effect (CATE).

One compelling notion proposed in the literature is that of\nindividual fairness (IF), which advocates that similar individuals should be\ntreated similarly (Dwork et al. 2012). Originally proposed for offline\ndecisions, this notion does not, however, account for temporal considerations\nrelevant for online decision-making. In this paper, we extend the notion of IF\nto account for the time at which a decision is made, in settings where there\nexists a notion of conduciveness of decisions as perceived by the affected\nindividuals. We introduce two definitions: (i) fairness-across-time (FT) and\n(ii) fairness-in-hindsight (FH). FT is the simplest temporal extension of IF\nwhere treatment of individuals is required to be individually fair relative to\nthe past as well as future, while in FH, we require a one-sided notion of\nindividual fairness that is defined relative to only the past decisions. We\nshow that these two definitions can have drastically different implications in\nthe setting where the principal needs to learn the utility model. Linear regret\nrelative to optimal individually fair decisions is inevitable under FT for\nnon-trivial examples. On the other hand, we design a new algorithm: Cautious\nFair Exploration (CaFE), which satisfies FH and achieves sub-linear regret\nguarantees for a broad range of settings.

The heart of the algorithm is an expansion\nin Laguerre polynomials, which has several advantages, including automatic\nconservation of both energy and particles without the need for any special\ndiscretization or time-stepping schemes. One drawback is the $O(N^3)$ memory\nrequirement, where $N$ is the number of polynomials used. This can impose an\ninconvenient limit in cases of practical interest, such as when two particle\nspecies have widely separated temperatures. The algorithm we describe here\naddresses this problem by periodically re-projecting the solution onto a\njudicious choice of new basis functions that are still Laguerre polynomials but\nhave arguments adapted to the current physical conditions. This results in a\nreduction in the number of polynomials needed, at the expense of increased\nsolution time. Because the equations are solved with little difficulty, this\nadded time is not of much concern compared to the savings in memory. To\ndemonstrate the algorithm, we solve several relaxation problems that could not\nbe computed with the spectral method without re-projection. Another major\nadvantage of this method is that it can be used for collision operators more\ncomplicated than that of the Landau equation, and we demonstrate this here by\nusing it to solve the non-degenerate quantum Lenard-Balescu equation for a\nhydrogen plasma.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Dec 2018 20:55:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-12"}

Using the Very Deep\nSuper-Resolution (VDSR) framework and a custom Random Forest Super-Resolution\n(RFSR) framework we generate enhancement levels of 2x, 4x, and 8x over five\ndistinct resolutions ranging from 30 cm to 4.8 meters.

Currently, the largest measured\nprojected angle between the orbital angular momentum axis of a planet and the\nrotation axis of its host star has been found for HAT-P-14b to be $\\approx$\n171{\\deg}. One possible mechanism for the formation of such misalignments is\nthrough long-term interactions between the planet and other planetary or\nstellar companions. However, with this process, it has been found to be\ndifficult to achieve retrogradely orbiting planets, especially planets that\nalmost exactly counter-orbit their host star ({\\phi} $\\approx$ 180{\\deg}) such\nas HAT-P-14b. By contrast, orbital misalignment can be produced efficiently by\nperturbations of planetary systems that are passed by stars.

Our simulations show that depending on\nthe mass ratio of the involved stars, there are significant ranges of planetary\npre-encounter parameters for which counter-orbiting planets are the natural\nconsequence. We find that the highest probability to produce counter-orbiting\nplanets ($\\approx$ 20%) is achieved with close prograde, coplanar fly-bys of an\nequal-mass perturber with a pericentre distance of one-third of the initial\norbital radius of the planet.

This allows one to\ndetermine all higher order flow cumulants $v_n\\lbrace 2s\\rbrace$ with the same\nparametric accuracy. For a phenomenologically relevant range of $N$ sources\nemitting $m$ particles, we find that the even flow coefficients $v_n\\lbrace\n2s\\rbrace$ decrease very mildly with increasing cumulants. This provides a\nproof of principle that non-vanishing higher order cumulants $v_n\\lbrace\n2s\\rbrace$ can persist in systems that exhibit neither final state interactions\nnor phenomena related to high (saturated) initial parton densities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Dec 2018 21:50:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-05"}

However, in real\nclinical imaging scenarios, entire body CT images (e.g., neck, abdomen, chest,\npelvis) are typically captured along with whole brain CT scans. For instance,\nin a typical sample of clinical TBI imaging cohort, only ~15% of CT scans\nactually contain whole brain CT images suitable for volumetric brain analyses;\nthe remaining are partial brain or non-brain images. Therefore, a manual image\nretrieval process is typically required to isolate the whole brain CT scans\nfrom the entire cohort. However, the manual image retrieval is time and\nresource consuming and even more difficult for the larger cohorts. To alleviate\nthe manual efforts, in this paper we propose an automated 3D medical image\nretrieval pipeline, called deep montage-based image retrieval (dMIR), which\nperforms classification on 2D montage images via a deep convolutional neural\nnetwork. The novelty of the proposed method for image processing is to\ncharacterize the medical image retrieval task based on the montage images. In a\ncohort of 2000 clinically acquired TBI scans, 794 scans were used as training\ndata, 206 scans were used as validation data, and the remaining 1000 scans were\nused as testing data.

Due to the\nhigh cost of SSDs, entirely replacing HDDs with SSDs is not economically\njustified. Additionally, SSDs can endure a limited number of writes before\nfailing. To mitigate the shortcomings of SSDs while taking advantage of their\nhigh performance, SSD caching is practiced in both academia and industry.\nPreviously proposed caching architectures have only focused on either\nperformance or endurance and neglected to address both parameters in suggested\narchitectures. Moreover, the cost, reliability, and power consumption of such\narchitectures is not evaluated. This paper proposes a hybrid I/O caching\narchitecture that while offers higher performance than previous studies, it\nalso improves power consumption with a similar budget. The proposed\narchitecture uses DRAM, Read-Optimized SSD, and Write-Optimized SSD in a\nthree-level cache hierarchy and tries to efficiently redirect read requests to\neither DRAM or RO-SSD while sending writes to WO-SSD. To provide high\nreliability, dirty pages are written to at least two devices which removes any\nsingle point of failure. The power consumption is also managed by reducing the\nnumber of accesses issued to SSDs. The proposed architecture reconfigures\nitself between performance- and endurance-optimized policies based on the\nworkload characteristics to maintain an effective tradeoff between performance\nand endurance. We have implemented the proposed architecture on a server\nequipped with industrial SSDs and HDDs. The experimental results show that as\ncompared to state-of-the-art studies, the proposed architecture improves\nperformance and power consumption by an average of 8% and 28%, respectively,\nand reduces the cost by 5% while increasing the endurance cost by 4.7% and\nnegligible reliability penalty.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Dec 2018 22:00:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-12"}

The\nbasic RSST equations are hyperbolic, and are suitable for parallel computation\nby domain decomposition. The application of RSST is limited to cases where\ndensity perturbations are much smaller than the background density. In\naddition, non-conservative variables are required to be evolved using this\nmethod, which is not suitable in cases where discontinuities like shock waves\nco-exist in a single numerical domain. In this study, we suggest a new\nsemi-conservative formulation of the RSST that can be applied to low Mach\nnumber flows with large density variations. We derive the wave speed of the\noriginal and newly suggested methods to clarify that these methods can reduce\nthe speed of sound without affecting the entropy wave. The equations are\nimplemented using the finite volume method. Several numerical tests are carried\nout to verify the suggested methods. The analysis and numerical results show\nthat the original RSST is not applicable when mass density variations are\nlarge. In contrast, the newly suggested methods are found to be efficient in\nsuch cases. We also suggest variants of the RSST that conserve momentum in the\nmachine precision. The newly suggested variants are formulated as\nsemi-conservative equations, which reduce to the conservative form of the Euler\nequations when the speed of sound is not reduced. This property is advantageous\nwhen both high and low Mach number regions are included in the numerical\ndomain.

This is prompting questions on the nature of scientific knowledge. A\ncentral issue is what defines a 'good' model. When addressing global properties\nof the Universe or its initial state this becomes a particularly pressing\nissue. How to assess the probability of the Universe as a whole is empirically\nambiguous, since we can examine only part of a single realisation of the system\nunder investigation: at some point, data will run out. We review the basics of\napplying Bayesian statistical explanation to the Universe as a whole. We argue\nthat a conventional Bayesian approach to model inference generally fails in\nsuch circumstances, and cannot resolve, e.g., the so-called 'measure problem'\nin inflationary cosmology. Implicit and non-empirical valuations inevitably\nenter model assessment in these cases. This undermines the possibility to\nperform Bayesian model comparison. One must therefore either stay silent, or\npursue a more general form of systematic and rational model assessment. We\noutline a generalised axiological Bayesian model inference framework, based on\nmathematical lattices. This extends inference based on empirical data\n(evidence) to additionally consider the properties of model structure\n(elegance) and model possibility space (beneficence).

We have recently developed a method to capture the behaviour\nof the stellar phase-space distribution function at a resonance, by\nre-expressing it in terms of a new set of canonical actions and angles\nvariables valid in the resonant region. Here, by properly treating the\ndistribution function at resonances, and by using a realistic model for a\nslowly rotating large Galactic bar with pattern speed 39 km/s/kpc, we show that\nno less than six ridges in local action space can be related to resonances with\nthe bar. Two of these at low angular momentum correspond to the corotation\nresonance, and can be associated to the Hercules moving group in local velocity\nspace. Another one at high angular momentum corresponds to the outer Lindblad\nresonance, and can tentatively be associated to the velocity structure seen as\nan arch at high azimuthal velocities in Gaia data. The other ridges are\nassociated to the 3:1, 4:1 and 6:1 resonances. The latter can be associated to\nthe so-called 'horn' of the local velocity distribution. While it is clear that\neffects from spiral arms and incomplete phase-mixing related to external\nperturbations also play a role in shaping the complex kinematics revealed by\nGaia data, the present work demonstrates that, contrary to common\nmisconceptions, the bar alone can create multiple prominent ridges in velocity\nand action space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Dec 2018 23:39:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Jan 2019 15:33:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 17 Apr 2019 15:31:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 18 Apr 2019 13:31:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-19"}

However, there are numerous applications\nwhere the cardinal absolute-valued feedback model (e.g. ratings from one to\nfive) is not suitable. This has motivated the formulation of the duelling\nbandits problem, where the learner picks a pair of actions and observes a noisy\nbinary feedback, indicating a relative preference between the two. There exist\na multitude of different settings and interpretations of the problem for two\nreasons. First, due to the absence of a total order of actions, there is no\nnatural definition of the best action. Existing work either explicitly assumes\nthe existence of a linear order, or uses a custom definition for the winner.\nSecond, there are multiple reasonable notions of regret to measure the\nlearner's performance. Most prior work has been focussing on the\n$\\textit{strong regret}$, which averages the quality of the two actions picked.\nThis work focusses on the $\\textit{weak regret}$, which is based on the quality\nof the better of the two actions selected. Weak regret is the more appropriate\nperformance measure when the pair's inferior action has no significant\ndetrimental effect on the pair's quality.\n  We study the duelling bandits problem in the adversarial setting. We provide\nan algorithm which has theoretical guarantees in both the utility-based\nsetting, which implies a total order, and the unrestricted setting. For the\nlatter, we work with the $\\textit{Borda winner}$, finding the action maximising\nthe probability of winning against an action sampled uniformly at random. The\nthesis concludes with experimental results based on both real-world data and\nsynthetic data, showing the algorithm's performance and limitations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Dec 2018 23:43:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-12"}

For a given\ncombinatorial optimization problem instance, the quantum expectation of the\nassociated cost function is the parameter dependent objective function of the\nQAOA. We demonstrate that if the parameters are fixed and the instance comes\nfrom a reasonable distribution then the objective function value is\nconcentrated in the sense that typical instances have (nearly) the same value\nof the objective function. This applies not just for optimal parameters as the\nwhole landscape is instance independent. We can prove this is true for low\ndepth quantum circuits for instances of MaxCut on large 3-regular graphs. Our\nresults generalize beyond this example. We support the arguments with numerical\nexamples that show remarkable concentration.

This is\narguably due to the fact that detection models are designed to operate on\nsingle frames and as a result do not have a mechanism for learning motion\nrepresentations directly from video. We propose a learning procedure that\nallows detection models such as Faster R-CNN to learn motion features directly\nfrom the RGB video data while being optimized with respect to a pose estimation\ntask. Given a pair of video frames---Frame A and Frame B---we force our model\nto predict human pose in Frame A using the features from Frame B. We do so by\nleveraging deformable convolutions across space and time. Our network learns to\nspatially sample features from Frame B in order to maximize pose detection\naccuracy in Frame A. This naturally encourages our network to learn motion\noffsets encoding the spatial correspondences between the two frames. We refer\nto these motion offsets as DiMoFs (Discriminative Motion Features).\n  In our experiments we show that our training scheme helps learn effective\nmotion cues, which can be used to estimate and localize salient human motion.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that as a byproduct, our model also learns features\nthat lead to improved pose detection in still-images, and better keypoint\ntracking. Finally, we show how to leverage our learned model for the tasks of\nspatiotemporal action localization and fine-grained action recognition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 01:06:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-12"}

In other words, given any smooth connected family f:X -> Zof\nFano manifolds, if one fiber is biholomorphic to a rational homogeneous space\nS, whether is f an S-fibration? The cases of Picard number one were studied in\na series of papers by J.-M. Hwang and N. Mok. For higher Picard number cases,\nwe notice that the Picard number of a rational homogeneous space G/P is less or\nequal to the rank of G. Recently A. Weber and J. A. Wisniewski proved that\nrational homogeneous spaces G/P with Picard numbers equal to the rank of G\n(i.e. complete flag manifolds) are rigid under Fano deformation. In this paper\nwe show that the rational homogeneous space G/P is rigid under Fano\ndeformation, providing that G is a simple algebraic group of type ADE, the\nPicard number equal to rank(G)-1 and G/P is not biholomorphic to F(1, 2, P^3)\nor F(1, 2, Q^6). The variety F(1, 2, P^3) is the set of flags of projective\nlines and planes in P^3, and F(1, 2, Q^6) is the set of flags of projective\nlines and planes in 6-dimensional smooth quadric hypersurface. We show that\nF(1, 2, P^3) have a unique Fano degeneration, which is explicitly constructed.\nThe structure of possible Fano degeneration of F(1, 2, Q^6) is also described\nexplicitly.

It is\nhypothesized that the bar can either stabilize the gas against collapse,\ninhibiting star formation or efficiently consume all the available gas, with no\nfuel for further star formation. We present a multi-wavelength study using the\narchival data of an early-type barred spiral galaxy, Messier 95, which shows\nsignatures of suppressed star formation in the bar-region. Using the optical,\nultraviolet, infrared, CO and HI imaging data we study the pattern of star\nformation progression, stellar/gas distribution and try to provide insights on\nthe process responsible for the observed pattern. The FUV$-$NUV pixel colour\nmap reveals a cavity devoid of UV flux in the bar-region that interestingly\nmatches with the length of the bar ($\\sim$ 4.2kpc). The central nuclear region\nof the galaxy is showing a blue color clump and along the major-axis of the\nstellar bar the colour progressively becomes redder. Based on a comparison to\nsingle stellar population models, we show that the region of galaxy along the\nmajor-axis of the bar (unlike the region outside the bar) is comprised of\nstellar populations with ages $\\geq$ 350 Myr, with a star-forming clump in the\ncenter of younger ages ($\\sim$ 150Myr). Interestingly the bar-region is also\ndevoid of neutral and molecular hydrogen but with an abundant molecular\nhydrogen present at the nuclear region of the galaxy. Our results are\nconsistent with a picture in which the stellar bar in Messier 95 is\nredistributing the gas by funneling gas inflows to nuclear region, thus making\nthe bar-region devoid of fuel for star formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 01:29:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-09"}

Existing methods commonly address this problem by employing\nbounding boxes on the target humans as part of the input, in both training and\ntesting stages. This requirement of bounding boxes as part of the input is\nneeded to enable the methods to ignore irrelevant contexts and extract only\nhuman features. However, we consider this solution is inefficient, since the\nbounding boxes might not be available. Hence, instead of using a person\nbounding box as an input, we introduce a human-mask loss to automatically guide\nthe activations of the feature maps to the target human who is performing the\naction, and hence suppress the activations of misleading contexts. We propose a\nmulti-task deep learning method that jointly predicts the human action class\nand human location heatmap.

This paper\nintroduces a causal network that captures the causal connections among the\ncross-sectional units over the two periods.

When the observed network does not satisfy this condition,\nbut the spillover effect is nonnegative, the spatio-temporal dependence measure\nserves as a lower bound for diffusion. Using this, a lower confidence bound for\ndiffusion is proposed and its asymptotic validity is established.

The optical\neffects of the Moon's space weathering have been largely investigated in the\nlaboratory for lunar samples and lunar analogues. However, duplication of the\npristine regolith on Earth is not possible. Here we report the space weathering\nfrom the unique perspective of the Chang'E-3's (CE-3) \"Yutu\" rover, building on\nour previous work (Wang et al. 2017; Wu and Hapke 2018). Measurement of the\nvisually undisturbed uppermost regolith as well as locations that have been\naffected by rocket exhaust from the spacecraft by the Visible-Near Infrared\nSpectrometer (VNIS) revealed that the returned samples bring a biased\ninformation about the pristine lunar regolith. The uppermost surficial regolith\nis much more weathered than the regolith immediately below, and the finest\nfraction is rich in space weathered products. These materials are very dark and\nattenuated throughout the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) wavelengths, hence\nreduce the reflectance and mask the absorption features. The effects on the\nspectral slope caused by space weathering are wavelength-dependent: the visible\nand near-infrared continuum slope (VNCS) increases while the visible slope (VS)\ndecreases. In the visible wavelength, the optical effects of space weathering\nand TiO2 are identical: both reduce albedo and blue the spectra. This suggests\nthat developing new TiO2 abundance algorithm is needed. Optical maturity\nindices are composition related and hence only locally meaningful. Since\noptical remote sensing can only sense the uppermost few microns of regolith and\nsince this surface tends to be very weathered, the interpretation of surface\ncomposition using optical remote sensing data needs to be carefully evaluated.\nSampling the uppermost surface is suggested.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 02:55:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-17"}

Recently, a\nstriking similarity between the SYK model and the Hund-coupling induced\nspin-freezing crossover in multi-orbital Hubbard models has been pointed out.\nTo further explore this connection, we study OTOCs for fermionic Hubbard\nmodels, which are prototypical models for strongly correlated electrons in\nsolids. We introduce an imaginary-time four-point correlation function with an\nappropriate time ordering, which by means of the spectral representation and\nthe out-of-time-order fluctuation-dissipation theorem can be analytically\ncontinued to real-time OTOCs. Based on this approach, we numerically evaluate\nreal-time OTOCs for Hubbard models in the thermodynamic limit, using the\ndynamical mean-field theory in combination with a numerically exact\ncontinuous-time Monte Carlo impurity solver. The results for the single-orbital\nmodel show that a certain spin-related OTOC captures local moment formation in\nthe vicinity of the metal-insulator transition, while the self-energy does not\nshow SYK-like non-Fermi liquid behavior. On the other hand, for the two- and\nthree-orbital models with nonzero Hund coupling we find that the OTOC exhibits\na rapid damping at short times and an approximate power-law decay at longer\ntimes in the spin-freezing crossover regime characterized by fluctuating local\nmoments and a non-Fermi liquid self-energy $\\Sigma(\\omega) \\sim \\sqrt{\\omega}$.\nThese results are in a good agreement with the behavior of the SYK model,\nproviding firm evidence for the close relation between the spin-freezing\ncrossover physics of multi-orbital Hubbard models and the SYK strange metal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 04:44:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 22 Jun 2019 08:35:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-25"}

However, a rational comprehensive approach to\nfabricating intrinsically icephobic surfaces for frost formation-both from\nwater condensation (followed by freezing) and in particular from desublimation\n(direct growth of ice crystals from vapor)-remains elusive. Here, guided by\nnucleation physics, we investigate the effect of material composition and\nsurface texturing (atomically smooth to nanorough) on the nucleation and growth\nmechanism of frost for a range of conditions within the sublimation domain (0 C\nto -55C; partial water vapor pressures 6 to 0.02 mbar). Surprisingly, we\nobserve that on silicon at very cold temperatures-below the homogeneous ice\nsolidification nucleation limit (< -46 C)-desublimation does not become the\nfavorable pathway to frosting. Furthermore we show that surface nanoroughness\nmakes frost formation on silicon more probable.

The occurrence of wave-blocking is confirmed by finding a critical wave\nfrequency in a particular flow discharge in which the waves are effectively\nblocked and is established using the linear dispersion relation. The novelty of\nthis work is to identify the wave-blocking and its influence on the development\nof bed forms over the sediment bed. Interesting bed form signatures are\nobserved at a transition of bed forms in three zones, with asymmetric ripples\nhaving a steeper slope downstream face induced by the incoming current,\nfollowed by flat sand bars beneath the wave-blocking zone and more symmetric\nripples below the wave-dominated region at the downstream. This phenomenon\nsuggests that the sediment bed is segmented into three different regions of bed\ngeometry along the flow. The deviations of mean flows, Reynolds stresses,\nturbulent kinetic energy, and power spectral density due to the wave-blocking\nphenomenon are presented along the non-uniform flow over sediment bed. The\nbottom shear stress, bed roughness and stochastic nature of the bed form\nfeatures are also discussed.

This memory has slowly-decaying power-law tails.\nSuch a long-range character of the memory complicates the description of the\nresulting real-time dynamics on large time scales. In a numerical simulation,\nthis problem manifests itself in a `revival', a spurious reflected signal which\nappears after a finite time thus invalidating the simulation. In the present\nwork, we approach this problem and develop a numerical discretization of the\nbath without revivals. We find that a crucial role is played by the\nsingularities of the bath spectral density (e.g. edges of bands): the memory\nabout the (spectral) behaviour of the open system in the remote past is\ncompletely averaged out (forgotten), except an increasingly small vicinity of\nthese singular frequencies. Therefore, we introduce the concept of memory\nchannel, to denote such an irreversible information loss process around a\nparticular singular frequency. On a technical side, we begin the treatment by\nnoting that with respect to the memory loss, the quantum field of the bath\nshould be divided into the following two different parts: the observable and\nthe virtual quanta. Information about the former is never lost: they contribute\nto the trace over the bath degrees of freedom. The only way to avoid the\nrevival from the observable quanta is to calculate their dynamics exactly. We\ndo this by employing a stochastic sampling of the Husimi function of the bath.\nThe other part, the virtual quanta, are always annihilated after a certain\ndelay time. We construct a dedicated quantum representation for the virtual\nstates by assigning amplitudes to the delay times before annihilation. It is in\nthis representation we rigorously define the concept of memory channels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 08:26:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-05"}

The first rigorous proof of the\ninstability of AdS in the simplest spherically symmetric setting, namely for\nthe Einstein-null dust system, was obtained in [G. Moschidis, A proof of the\ninstability of AdS for the Einstein-null dust system with an inner mirror,\n2017, arXiv:1704.08681]. In that work, the evolution was restricted to the\nexterior of an inner mirror placed at $r=r_{0}>0$, in order to circumvent the\ntrivial break down of the Einstein-null dust system occurring at $r=0$; in that\nsetting, additional considerations necessitated $r_{0}$ to shrink to $0$ with\nthe size of the initial perturbation.\n  In this paper, we establish the instability of AdS for the Einstein-massless\nVlasov system in spherical symmetry.

Starting from a variational formulation for image restoration, we\ndevelop iRestNet, a neural network architecture obtained by unfolding a\nproximal interior point algorithm. Hard constraints, encoding desirable\nproperties for the restored image, are incorporated into the network thanks to\na logarithmic barrier, while the barrier parameter, the stepsize, and the\npenalization weight are learned by the network. We derive explicit expressions\nfor the gradient of the proximity operator for various choices of constraints,\nwhich allows training iRestNet with gradient descent and backpropagation. In\naddition, we provide theoretical results regarding the stability of the network\nfor a common inverse problem example. Numerical experiments on image deblurring\nproblems show that the proposed approach compares favorably with both\nstate-of-the-art variational and machine learning methods in terms of image\nquality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 09:02:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2018 13:41:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 16 Jul 2019 09:46:34 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 22 Jul 2019 09:10:44 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 21 Jan 2020 19:11:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-23"}

In addition, the initial cluster\ncenters in the learned feature space are generated by $k$-means. This only\nworks well on spherical clusters and probably leads to unstable clustering\nresults.

The first stage is to train\na deep convolutional autoencoder (CAE) to extract low-dimensional feature\nrepresentations from high-dimensional image data, and then apply t-SNE to\nfurther reduce the data to a 2-dimensional space favoring density-based\nclustering algorithms. The second stage is to apply the developed density-based\nclustering technique on the 2-dimensional embedded data to automatically\nrecognize an appropriate number of clusters with arbitrary shapes. Concretely,\na number of local clusters are generated to capture the local structures of\nclusters, and then are merged via their density relationship to form the final\nclustering result.

To combat adversarial strategies, numerous defensive techniques have\nbeen proposed. Among these, a promising approach is to use randomness in order\nto make the classification process unpredictable and presumably harder for the\nadversary to control. In this paper, we study the effectiveness of randomized\ndefenses against adversarial samples. To this end, we categorize existing\nstate-of-the-art adversarial strategies into three attacker models of\nincreasing strength, namely blackbox, graybox, and whitebox (a.k.a.~adaptive)\nattackers.

However, existing methods rely heavily on\nfully connected layers, which introduce a significant amount of parameters,\nmaking the network harder to train and prone to overfitting problems. In this\npaper, we propose a simple yet effective framework for point set feature\nlearning by leveraging a nonlinear activation layer encoded by Radial Basis\nFunction (RBF) kernels. Unlike PointNet variants, that fail to recognize local\npoint patterns, our approach explicitly models the spatial distribution of\npoint clouds by aggregating features from sparsely distributed RBF kernels. A\ntypical RBF kernel, e.g. Gaussian function, naturally penalizes long-distance\nresponse and is only activated by neighboring points. Such localized response\ngenerates highly discriminative features given different point distributions.\nIn addition, our framework allows the joint optimization of kernel distribution\nand its receptive field, automatically evolving kernel configurations in an\nend-to-end manner. We demonstrate that the proposed network with a single RBF\nlayer can outperform the state-of-the-art Pointnet++ in terms of classification\naccuracy for 3D object recognition tasks. Moreover, the introduction of\nnonlinear mappings significantly reduces the number of network parameters and\ncomputational cost, enabling significantly faster training and a deployable\npoint cloud recognition solution on portable devices with limited resources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 09:45:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 6 Apr 2019 11:39:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-09"}

The question of spatial\norganization of all these components remains open despite of a number of\nrecently developed methods of LSS analysis. In this paper we introduce new\ncontinuous structural parameter of galaxy distribution for the determinig of\nthe type of LSS surrounding. This parameter is based on comparison of the\nradial distribution of galaxies around the certain point with the uniform one.\nOur method for structure parameter calculation is based on the distribution of\n1000 closets galaxies to the selected one. Such number was selected because\nmost galaxy clusters contains up to 1000 galaxies. When we exceed 1000th\nclosest galaxy we will leave possible cluster or filament and will pass to\nanother type of LSS. We suppose that in uniform distribution of galaxies their\nnumber should increase as third power a distance, similar to luminosity.\nTherefore the inverse dependence of galaxy distance from number should be cubic\nroot. New structural parameter was introduced as the difference of this\ndependence of cubic root. The main type of cosmic surrounding for a galaxy is\ndefined by the value and the sign of such structural parameter. If a galaxy lie\nin a cluster the distances of nearby galaxies will be less than cubic root. We\nintegrated distance difference for all 1000 galaxies and get negative stuctural\nparameter in this case. In the case of void the structural parameter will be\npositive. New parameter was calculated for sky distribution of SDSS galaxies at\ndistances from 50 to 150 Mpc. Analysing obtained values, we come to conclusion\nthat our structural parameter can be used for the division of LSS components\nand extragalactic filament detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 10:07:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-12"}

However, the energy transfer between the inner UFO and the outer\nmolecular outflow has not yet fully studied mainly due to the limited sample.\nIn this paper, we performed comparison of their kinetic energy using the\nmm/sub-mm published data and the X-ray archival data. Among fourteen Seyfert\ngalaxies whose molecular outflows are detected in the IRAM/PdBI data, eight\ntargets are bright enough to perform spectral fitting in X-ray, and we have\ndetected UFO absorption lines in six targets with 90% significance level, using\nXMM-Newton and Suzaku satellites. The time-averaged UFO kinetic energy was\nderived from the spectral fitting. As a result, we have found that the\nenergy-transfer rate (kinetic energy ratio of the molecular outflow to the UFO)\nranges from $\\sim7\\times10^{-3}$ to $\\sim$1, and has a negative correlation\nwith the BH mass, which shows that the AGN feedback is more efficient in the\nlower mass BHs.

Mathematically, ResNet\narchitectures can be interpreted as forward Euler discretizations of a\nnonlinear initial value problem whose time-dependent control variables\nrepresent the weights of the neural network. Hence, training a ResNet can be\ncast as an optimal control problem of the associated dynamical system. For\nsimilar time-dependent optimal control problems arising in engineering\napplications, parallel-in-time methods have shown notable improvements in\nscalability. This paper demonstrates the use of those techniques for efficient\nand effective training of ResNets. The proposed algorithms replace the\nclassical (sequential) forward and backward propagation through the network\nlayers by a parallel nonlinear multigrid iteration applied to the layer domain.\nThis adds a new dimension of parallelism across layers that is attractive when\ntraining very deep networks. From this basic idea, we derive multiple\nlayer-parallel methods. The most efficient version employs a simultaneous\noptimization approach where updates to the network parameters are based on\ninexact gradient information in order to speed up the training process. Using\nnumerical examples from supervised classification, we demonstrate that the new\napproach achieves similar training performance to traditional methods, but\nenables layer-parallelism and thus provides speedup over layer-serial methods\nthrough greater concurrency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 12:26:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Feb 2019 14:20:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 25 Jul 2019 05:58:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-26"}

The Earth's crust\nmay contain at least three times more water than the oceans. This crust water\nis found in the form of phyllosilicates, whose origin probably differs from\nthat of the oceans. We test the possibility to form phyllosilicates in\nprotoplanetary disks, which can be the building blocks of terrestrial planets.\nWe developed an exploratory rate-based warm surface chemistry model where water\nfrom the gas-phase can chemisorb on dust grain surfaces and subsequently\ndiffuse into the silicate cores. We apply the phyllosilicate formation model to\na zero-dimensional chemical model and to a 2D protoplanetary disk model\n(ProDiMo). The disk model includes in addition to the cold and warm surface\nchemistry continuum and line radiative transfer, photoprocesses\n(photodissociation, photoionization, and photodesorption), gas-phase cold and\nwarm chemistry including three-body reactions, and detailed thermal balance.\nDespite the high energy barrier for water chemisorption on silicate grain\nsurfaces and for diffusion into the core, the chemisorption sites at the\nsurfaces can be occupied by a hydroxyl bond (-OH) at all gas and dust\ntemperatures from 80 to 700 K for a gas density of 2E4 cm^-3. The chemisorption\nsites in the silicate cores are occupied at temperatures between 250 and 700 K.\nAt higher temperatures thermal desorption of chemisorbed water occurs. The\noccupation efficiency is only limited by the maximum water uptake of the\nsilicate. The timescales for complete hydration are at most 1E5 years for 1 mm\nradius grains at a gas density of 1E8 cm^-3. Phyllosilicates can be formed on\ndust grains at the dust coagulation stage in protoplanetary disks within 1 Myr.\nIt is however not clear whether the amount of phyllosilicate formed by warm\nsurface chemistry is sufficient compared to that found in Solar System objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 12:36:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-04"}

For Etsy, an online marketplace with over 50\nmillion handmade and vintage items, users come to rely on personalized\nrecommendations to surface relevant items from its massive inventory. One\nhallmark of Etsy's shopping experience is the multitude of ways in which a user\ncan interact with an item they are interested in: they can view it, favorite\nit, add it to a collection, add it to cart, purchase it, etc. We hypothesize\nthat the different ways in which a user interacts with an item indicates\ndifferent kinds of intent. Consequently, a user's recommendations should be\nbased not only on the item from their past activity, but also the way in which\nthey interacted with that item. In this paper, we propose a novel method for\nlearning interaction-based item embeddings that encode the co-occurrence\npatterns of not only the item itself, but also the interaction type. The\nlearned embeddings give us a convenient way of approximating the likelihood\nthat one item-interaction pair would co-occur with another by way of a simple\ninner product. Because of its computational efficiency, our model lends itself\nnaturally as a candidate set selection method, and we evaluate it as such in an\nindustry-scale recommendation system that serves live traffic on Etsy.com. Our\nexperiments reveal that taking interaction type into account shows promising\nresults in improving the accuracy of modeling user shopping behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 14:06:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-12"}

While the preferences of rankers can be inferred by interleaving\nmethods, the problem of how to effectively choose the ranker pair that\ngenerates the interleaved list without degrading the user experience too much\nis still challenging. On the one hand, if two rankers have not been compared\nenough, the inferred preference can be noisy and inaccurate. On the other, if\ntwo rankers are compared too many times, the interleaving process inevitably\nhurts the user experience too much. This dilemma is known as the exploration\nversus exploitation tradeoff. It is captured by the $K$-armed dueling bandit\nproblem, which is a variant of the $K$-armed bandit problem, where the feedback\ncomes in the form of pairwise preferences. Today's deployed search systems can\nevaluate a large number of rankers concurrently, and scaling effectively in the\npresence of numerous rankers is a critical aspect of $K$-armed dueling bandit\nproblems.\n  In this paper, we focus on solving the large-scale online ranker evaluation\nproblem under the so-called Condorcet assumption, where there exists an optimal\nranker that is preferred to all other rankers. We propose Merge Double Thompson\nSampling (MergeDTS), which first utilizes a divide-and-conquer strategy that\nlocalizes the comparisons carried out by the algorithm to small batches of\nrankers, and then employs Thompson Sampling (TS) to reduce the comparisons\nbetween suboptimal rankers inside these small batches. The effectiveness\n(regret) and efficiency (time complexity) of MergeDTS are extensively evaluated\nusing examples from the domain of online evaluation for web search. Our main\nfinding is that for large-scale Condorcet ranker evaluation problems, MergeDTS\noutperforms the state-of-the-art dueling bandit algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 14:07:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 9 Aug 2020 11:23:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-11"}

Identifying them can be a very\ntime-consuming task. This is especially true, if the animals look very similar\nand have only a small number of distinctive features, like elephants do. In\nmost cases the animals stay at one place only for a short period of time during\nwhich the animal needs to be identified for knowing whether it is important to\ncollect new data on it.

In this paper, we demonstrate that the situation is considerably\ndifferent in models that extend the Higgs sector by a real scalar singlet.\nBased on effective-theory arguments, the extra scalar is always allowed to\ncouple to the heavy neutrinos via singlet Yukawa terms. This opens up new RHN\ndecay channels leading to larger $CP$ violation as well as to a stronger\ndeparture from thermal equilibrium during leptogenesis. As a consequence, the\nbaryon asymmetry can be generated for a lightest RHN mass as low as 500 GeV and\nwithout the need for a highly degenerate RHN mass spectrum.

By allowing finite inter MBSs coupling,\nBICs splitting is observed and shows projection in transmission for asymmetric\ncoupling case as cuasi-BICs. As a consequence, we also show that the Fano\neffect, arising from interference phenomena between MBSs hybridization trough\nQD, is observed with a half-integer amplitude modulation. We believe our\nfindings can help to better understand the properties of MBSs and their\ninterplay with QDs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 14:36:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 May 2019 17:18:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-23"}

Increasing our knowledge of the interior structure, composition and\ndensity distribution of exoplanets is crucial to make progress in the\nunderstanding of exoplanetary formation, migration and habitability. However,\nthe directly measurable mass and radius values offer little constraint on\ninterior structure, because the inverse problem is highly degenerate. Therefore\nthere is a clear need for a third observable of exoplanet interiors. This third\nobservable can be the $k_2$ fluid Love number which measures the central mass\nconcentration of an exoplanet. Aims. The aims of this paper are (i) to develop\na basic model to fit the long-term radial velocity and TTV variations caused by\ntidal interactions, (ii) to apply the model to the WASP-18Ab system, and (iii)\nto estimate the Love number of the planet. Methods. Archival radial velocity,\ntransit and occultation timing data are collected and fitted via the model\nintroduced here. Results. The best model fit to the archival radial velocity\nand timing data of WASP-18Ab was obtained with a Love number of the massive\n($\\sim 10 M_\\mathrm{Jup}$) hot Jupiter WASP-18Ab: $k_{2,Love} =\n0.62^{+0.55}_{-0.19}$. This causes apsidal motion in the system, at a rate of\n$\\sim0.0087\\pm0.0033^\\circ / \\mathrm{days} \\approxeq 31.3\\pm11.8$\narcseconds/day.

Quantum materials with novel\nelectronic and optical properties have been proposed as the next frontier, but\nmuch remains to be discovered to actualize the promise. Here we report the\nfirst observation of topological quantum properties of chiral crystals in the\nRhSi family. We demonsrate that this material hosts novel phase of matter\nexhibiting nearly ideal topological surface properties that emerge as a\nconsequence of the crystals' structural chirality or handedness. We also\ndemonstrate that the electrons on the surface of this crystal show a highly\nunusual helicoid structure that spirals around two high-symmetry momenta\nsignalling its topological electronic chirality. Such helicoid Fermi arcs on\nthe surface experimentally characterize the topological charges of $\\pm{2}$,\nwhich arise from the bulk chiral fermions. The existence of bulk high-fold\ndegenerate fermions are guaranteed by the crystal symmetries, however, in order\nto determine the topological charge in the chiral crystals it is essential to\nidentify and study the helical arc states. Remarkably, these topological\nconductors we discovered exhibit helical Fermi arcs which are of length $\\pi$,\nstretching across the entire Brillouin zone and orders of magnitude larger than\nthose found in all known Weyl semimetals.

Using the\nplane-wave expansion method, we calculate the dispersion relations of the 3D\ncavity superlattice with the cubic inverse woodpile structure that reveal five\ncoupled-cavity bands, typical of quadrupole-like resonances. For three out of\nfive bands, we observe that the dispersion bandwidth is significantly larger in\nthe $(k_x, k_z)$-diagonal directions than in other directions.

To\nbetter understand their role in the mass transfer efficiency, we perform\nexperiments involving successive bubble nucleations from a predefined\nnucleation site which consists of a superhydrophobic pit on top of a\nmicromachined pillar. The experiments on bubble nucleation at these spots\npermit the comparison of mass transfer phenomena connected to electrolytically\ngenerated H$_2$ bubbles with the better-understood evolution of CO$_2$ bubbles\nin pressure-controlled supersaturated solutions. In both cases, bubbles grow in\na diffusion-dominated regime. For CO$_2$ bubbles, it is found that the growth\nrate coefficient of subsequent bubbles always decreases due to the effect of\ngas depletion. In contrast, during constant current electrolysis, the bubble\ngrowth rates are affected by the evolution of a boundary layer of dissolved\nH$_2$ gas near the flat electrode which competes with gas depletion. This\ncompetition results in three distinct regimes. Initially, the bubble growth\nslows down with each new bubble in the succession due to the dominant depletion\nof the newly-formed concentration boundary layer. In later stages, the growth\nrate increases due to a local increase of gas supersaturation caused by the\ncontinuous gas production and finally levels off to an approximate steady\ngrowth rate. The gas transport efficiency associated with the electrolytic\nbubble succession follows a similar trend in time. Finally, for both H$_2$ and\nCO$_2$ bubbles, detachment mostly occurs at smaller radii than theory predicts\nand at a surprisingly wide spread of sizes.
