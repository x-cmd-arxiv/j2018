We discuss how to\ndistinguish the two effects: Letting light propagate back and forth between two\nmirrors, the rotation due to gravitational optical activity cancels while the\nrotation due to the gravitational Faraday effect accumulates. In contrast, the\nrotation due to both effects accumulates in a ring cavity and a situation can\nbe created in which gravitational optical activity dominates.

Eating gestures can have large variability in motion depending on\nthe subject, utensil, and type of food or beverage being consumed. Previous\nworks have shown viable proofs-of-concept of recognizing eating gestures in\nlaboratory settings with small numbers of subjects and food types, but it is\nunclear how well these methods would work if tested on a larger population in\nnatural settings. As more subjects, locations and foods are tested, a larger\namount of motion variability could cause a decrease in recognition accuracy. To\nexplore this issue, this paper describes the collection and annotation of\n51,614 eating gestures taken by 269 subjects eating a meal in a cafeteria.\nExperiments are described that explore the complexity of hidden Markov models\n(HMMs) and the amount of training data needed to adequately capture the motion\nvariability across this large data set. Results found that HMMs needed a\ncomplexity of 13 states and 5 Gaussians to reach a plateau in accuracy,\nsignifying that a minimum of 65 samples per gesture type are needed. Results\nalso found that 500 training samples per gesture type were needed to identify\nthe point of diminishing returns in recognition accuracy. Overall, the findings\nprovide evidence that the size a data set typically used to demonstrate a\nlaboratory proofs-of-concept may not be sufficiently large enough to capture\nall the motion variability that could be expected in transitioning to\ndeployment with a larger population. Our data set, which is 1-2 orders of\nmagnitude larger than all data sets tested in previous works, is being made\npublicly available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 16:09:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-12"}

Recent literature has\nshown the promise of using linear and nonlinear decision rules in which\nwait-and-see decisions are represented as functions, whose parameters are\ndecision variables to be optimized, of the underlying uncertain parameters.\nDespite this growing success, solving real-world stochastic optimization\nproblems can become computationally prohibitive when using nonlinear decision\nrules, and in some cases, linear ones. Consequently, decision rules that offer\na competitive trade-off between solution quality and computational time become\nmore attractive. Whereas the extant research has always used homogeneous\ndecision rules, the major contribution of this paper is a computational\nexploration of hybrid decision rules. We first verify empirically that having\nhigher uncertainty resolution or more linear pieces in early stages is more\nsignificant than having it in late stages in terms of solution quality. Then we\nconduct a comprehensive computational study for non-increasing (i.e., higher\nuncertainty resolution in early stages) and non-decreasing (i.e., higher\nuncertainty resolution in late stages) hybrid decision rules to illustrate the\ntrade-off between solution quality and computational cost. We also demonstrate\na case where a linear decision rule is superior to a piecewise-linear decision\nrule within a simulator environment, which supports the need to assess the\nquality of decision rules obtained from a look-ahead model within a simulator\nrather than just using the look-ahead model's objective function value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 16:25:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-24"}

Through numerical\nsimulations we investigate this scenario for a range of viewing angles,\ninjected energies and matter densities at the time of the collapse. Depending\non the magnitude of the energy injection and the remnant density, we find two\ntypes of outflows: one with a narrow relativistic core and one with a\nwide-angle, but mildly relativistic outflow. Furthermore, very wide outflows\nare possible, but require energy releases in excess of 10^52 erg.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 16:32:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 2019 09:31:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-11"}

Thus, an important goal in the literature is to define the optimal\nchoice of sensor nodes that provides a reliable state reconstruction of the\nnetwork system state-space. This is an observability problem. In this paper, we\npropose a particle filtering (PF) framework as a way to assess observability\nproperties of a dynamical network, where each node is composed by an individual\ndynamical system. The PF framework is applied on two benchmarks, networks of\nKuramoto and R\\\"ossler oscillators, to investigate how the interplay between\ndynamics and topology impacts the network observability. Based on the numerical\nresults, we conjecture that, when the network nodal dynamics are heterogeneous,\nbetter observability is conveyed for sets of sensor nodes that share some\ndynamical affinity to its neighbourhood. Moreover, we also investigate how the\nchoice of an internal measured variable of a multidimensional sensor node\naffects the PF performance. The PF framework effectiveness as an observability\nmeasure is compared to a well-consolidated nonlinear observability metric for a\nsmall network case and some chaotic systems benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 17:08:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

The Control Forced Concurrent Precursor Method\n(CFCPM) proposed in this work combines an existing concurrent precursor method\nand a mean flow forcing method with a new extension of the controlled forcing\nmethod to impose turbulent inflow boundary conditions primarily, although not\nexclusively, for domains that require periodic boundary conditions. Turbulent\ninflow boundary conditions are imposed through a region of body forces added to\nthe momentum equations of the main simulation that transfers the precursor\nsimulation into the main domain. Controlled forcing planes, which come into\nplay as body forces added to the momentum equations on planes perpendicular to\nthe flow, located in the precursor simulation, allow for specific Reynolds\nstress tensors and mean velocities to be imposed. The mean flow controlled\nforcing method only modifies the mean velocity profiles, leaving the\nfluctuating velocity field untouched. The proposed fluctuating flow controlled\nforcing methods extends the application of the original controlled forcing\nmethod to multiple fluctuating velocity components and couples their\ncalculation in order to amplify the existing fluctuations present in the\nprecursor flow field so that prescribed anisotropic Reynolds stress tensors can\nbe reproduced.

We\nargued that a possible explanation of the acceleration of huge numbers of\nparticles producing white light emission, during the Sept. 6 events as well as\nduring white light flares in young Sun-like stars, might be attributed to the\nspecial accompanying conditions of the occurrence of magnetic reconnection at\nlow altitudes of their atmospheres.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 18:07:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

The\nmissing baryons are believed to reside in large-scale filaments in the form of\nwarm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM). In this work, we employ a novel stacking\napproach to explore the hot phases of the WHIM. Specifically, we utilize the\n470 ks Chandra LETG data of the luminous quasar, H1821+643, along with previous\nmeasurements of UV absorption line systems and spectroscopic redshift\nmeasurements of galaxies toward the quasar's sightline. We repeatedly blueshift\nand stack the X-ray spectrum of the quasar corresponding to the redshifts of\nthe 17 absorption line systems. Thus, we obtain a stacked spectrum with $8.0$\nMs total exposure, which allows us to probe X-ray absorption lines with\nunparalleled sensitivity. Based on the stacked data, we detect an OVII\nabsorption line that exhibits a Gaussian line profile and is statistically\nsignificant at the $3.3 \\sigma$ level. Since the redshifts of the UV absorption\nline systems were known a priori, this is the first definitive detection of an\nX-ray absorption line originating from the WHIM.

Using the\nmoving mesh code AREPO, we have investigated different models of AGN activity,\nranging from simple energy-driven spherical winds to collimated, mass-loaded,\nbipolar outflows in high resolution simulations of isolated dwarf galaxies\nhosting an active black hole.

This suggests that AGN feedback in\ndwarf galaxies is unlikely to directly regulate their global SFRs. There is,\nhowever, a significant effect on outflow properties, which are notably enhanced\nby the AGN to much higher outflow temperatures and velocities, in agreement\nwith kinematic signatures from the MaNGA survey.

As is\ngeneric in cosmological inference, extracting this information requires a\nlikelihood to be computed throughout a high-dimensional parameter space.\nEvaluating the likelihood requires a robust and accurate mapping between the\nparameters and observables, in this case the 1D flux power spectrum.\nCosmological simulations enable such a mapping, but due to computational time\nconstraints can only be evaluated at a handful of sample points; \"emulators\"\nare designed to interpolate between these.

To address this, we introduce an\nemulation procedure that employs Bayesian optimisation of the training set for\na Gaussian process interpolation scheme. Starting with a Latin hypercube\nsampling (other schemes with good space-filling properties can be used), we\niteratively augment the training set with extra simulations at new parameter\npositions which balance the need to reduce interpolation error while focussing\non regions of high likelihood. We show that smaller emulator error from the\nBayesian optimisation propagates to smaller widths on the posterior\ndistribution.

However, the study of tissue-scale mechanics is impaired by the\ndifficulty of direct measurement of stress in-vivo. Alternative, image-based\ninference schemes aim to estimate stress from snapshots of cellular geometry\nbut are challenged by sensitivity to fluctuations and measurement noise as well\nas the dependence on boundary conditions. Here we overcome these difficulties\nby introducing a new variational approach - the Geometrical Variation Method\n(GVM) - which exploits the fundamental duality between stress and cellular\ngeometry that exists in the state of mechanical equilibrium of discrete\nmechanical networks that approximate cellular tissues. In the Geometrical\nVariation Method, the two dimensional apical geometry of an epithelial tissue\nis approximated by a 2D tiling with Circular Arc Polygons (CAP) in which the\narcs represent intercellular interfaces defined by the balance of local line\ntension and pressure differentials between adjacent cells. We take advantage of\nlocal constraints that mechanical equilibrium imposes on CAP geometry to define\na variational procedure that extracts the best fitting equilibrium\nconfiguration from images of epithelial monolayers. The GVM-based stress\ninference algorithm has been validated by the comparison of the predicted\ncellular and mesoscopic scale stress and measured myosin II patterns in the\nepithelial tissue during Drosophila embryogenesis. GVM prediction of mesoscopic\nstress tensor correlates at the 80% level with the measured myosin distribution\nand reveals that most of the myosin II activity is involved in a static\ninternal force balance within the epithelial layer. Lastly, this study provides\na practical method for non-destructive estimation of stress in live epithelial\ntissues.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 20:29:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-01"}

Unfortunately, these predefined features may\nbe of variable discrimination power while extended to other tasks or even\nwithin the same task due to different nature of clips.

In\norder to plan the optimum flyby sequence the NH mission planners needed to\nlearn as much as possible about the target in advance of the encounter.\nSpecifically, from lightcurve data, encounter timing could be adjusted to\naccommodate a highly elongated, binary, or rapidly rotating target. HST\nastrometric (Porter et al. 2018) and stellar occultation (Buie et al. 2018)\nobservations constrained MU69's orbit and diameter (21-41 km for an albedo of\n0.15-0.04), respectively.

Current methods for the design of\nenergy efficient series elastic actuators use an optimization formulation that\ntypically assumes known operational conditions. This approach could lead to\nactuators that cannot perform in uncertain environments because elongation,\nspeed, or torque requirements may be beyond actuator specifications when the\noperation deviates from its nominal conditions. Addressing this gap, we propose\na convex optimization formulation to design the stiffness of series elastic\nactuators to minimize energy consumption and satisfy actuator constraints\ndespite uncertainty due to manufacturing of the spring, unmodeled dynamics,\nefficiency of the transmission, and the kinematics and kinetics of the load. In\nour formulation, we express energy consumption as a scalar convex-quadratic\nfunction of compliance. In the unconstrained case, this quadratic equation\nprovides an analytical solution to the optimal value of stiffness that\nminimizes energy consumption for arbitrary periodic reference trajectories. As\nactuator constraints, we consider peak motor torque, peak motor velocity,\nlimitations due to the speed-torque relationship of DC motors, and peak\nelongation of the spring.

Addressing this challenge, we\nprovide theory and implementations for a manifold version of the principal\nanalysis by conditional expectation (PACE) procedure that produces\nrepresentations intrinsic to the manifold, extending a well-established version\nof functional principal component analysis targeting sparsely sampled\nlongitudinal data in linear spaces. Key steps are local linear smoothing\nmethods for the estimation of a Fr\\'echet mean curve, mapping the observed\nmanifold-valued longitudinal data to tangent spaces around the estimated mean\ncurve, and applying smoothing methods to obtain the covariance structure of the\nmapped data.

Recently, approaches that align distributions\nof source and target images using an adversarial loss have been proven\neffective for adapting object classifiers. However, for object detection, fully\nmatching the entire distributions of source and target images to each other at\nthe global image level may fail, as domains could have distinct scene layouts\nand different combinations of objects. On the other hand, strong matching of\nlocal features such as texture and color makes sense, as it does not change\ncategory level semantics. This motivates us to propose a novel method for\ndetector adaptation based on strong local alignment and weak global alignment.\nOur key contribution is the weak alignment model, which focuses the adversarial\nalignment loss on images that are globally similar and puts less emphasis on\naligning images that are globally dissimilar. Additionally, we design the\nstrong domain alignment model to only look at local receptive fields of the\nfeature map.

For this\npurpose, a new expression of the two-body Green's function in the form of\nresolvents is proposed, which provides tractable and efficient means to\ncalculate the local vertex function with the Lanczos exact diagonalization (ED)\nmethod. This makes it possible to use the Lanczos ED method as a solver of the\neffective impurity Anderson model for LDFA, opening up the way to access low\ntemperatures for these perturbative extensions of the dynamical mean field\ntheory and to obtain accurate DOS and spectral functions on the real frequency\naxis by a new variant of the maximum entropy method.

The computational complexity of\nMultiscale Fast Spectral Clustering is O(nlogn) and its memory cost is O(m).\nExtensive experiments on real large-scale images demonstrate that Multiscale\nFast Spectral Clustering outperforms Normalized cut in terms of lower\ncomputational complexity and memory cost, with comparable clustering accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2018 05:50:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-13"}

However, such services suffer from\nlocation data leakage which has become one of today's most concerning privacy\nissues for smartphone users. In this paper we focus specifically on location\ndata that is exposed by Android applications via Internet network traffic in\nplaintext (i.e., without encryption) without the user's awareness. We present\nan empirical evaluation, involving the network traffic of real mobile device\nusers, aimed at: (1) measuring the extent of location data leakage in the\nInternet traffic of Android-based smartphone devices; and (2) understanding the\nvalue of this data by inferring users' points of interests (POIs).

Metallic atomic-size contacts are ideal systems to probe the quantum\nlimits of transport. The thermal and electrical conductance of gold atomic\ncontacts has been recently proven to be quantized at room temperature. However,\na big experimental challenge in such measurements is represented by the fast\nbreaking dynamics of metallic junctions at room temperature, which can exceed\nthe typical response time of the thermal measurement. Here we use a\nbreak-junction setup that combines Scanning Tunneling Microscopy with suspended\nmicro electro-mechanical systems with a gold-covered membrane and an integrated\nheater acting also as thermometer.

In comparison to Internet users,\ndevelopers show interesting usage characteristics and have their own\ninterpretation of the meanings of emojis.

Through a manual\nannotation task, we find that sentimental usage is a main intention of using\nemojis in issues, pull requests, and comments, while emojis are mainly used to\nemphasize important contents in README.

However, this task is challenging because of the\nelusive nature of anomalies and the volatility of the ambient environments. In\na resource-scarce setting like WSN, this challenge is further elevated and\nweakens the suitability of many existing solutions. In this paper, for the\nfirst time, we introduce autoencoder neural networks into WSN to solve the\nanomaly detection problem. We design a two-part algorithm that resides on\nsensors and the IoT cloud respectively, such that (i) anomalies can be detected\nat sensors in a fully distributed manner without the need for communicating\nwith any other sensors or the cloud, and (ii) the relatively more\ncomputation-intensive learning task can be handled by the cloud with a much\nlower (and configurable) frequency.

Using a real WSN\nindoor testbed and sensor data collected over 4 consecutive months, we\ndemonstrate via experiments that our proposed autoencoder-based anomaly\ndetection mechanism achieves high detection accuracy and low false alarm rate.\nIt is also able to adapt to unforeseeable and new changes in a non-stationary\nenvironment, thanks to the unsupervised learning feature of our chosen\nautoencoder neural networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2018 10:10:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-14"}

Firstly, I demonstrate that quantum algorithms\ncan be applied to enhance the computing and training of Gaussian processes\n(GPs), a powerful model widely used in classical statistical inference and\nsupervised machine learning. A crucial component of the quantum GP algorithm is\nsolving linear systems with quantum computers, for which I present a novel\nalgorithm that achieves a provable advantage over previously known methods. I\nwill also explicitly address the task of encoding the classical data into a\nquantum state for machine learning applications. I then apply the quantum\nenhanced GPs to Bayesian deep learning and present an experimental\ndemonstration on contemporary hardware and simulators. Secondly, I look into\nthe notion of quantum causality and apply it to inferring spatial and temporal\nquantum correlations, and present an analytical toolkit for causal inference in\nquantum data. I will also make the connection between causality and quantum\ncommunications, and present a general bound for the quantum capacity of noisy\ncommunication channels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2018 10:18:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-13"}

To leverage Android's frequently released APIs,\ndevelopers must often spend considerable effort on API migrations. Prior\nresearch and Android official documentation typically provide enough\ninformation to guide developers in identifying the API calls that must be\nmigrated and the corresponding API calls in an updated version of Android (what\nto migrate). However, API migration remains a challenging task since developers\nlack the knowledge of how to migrate the API calls. There exist code examples,\nsuch as Google Samples, that illustrate the usage of APIs. We posit that by\nanalyzing the changes of API usage in code examples, we can learn API migration\npatterns to assist developers with API Migrations.\n  In this paper, we propose an approach that learns API migration patterns from\ncode examples, applies these patterns to the source code of Android apps for\nAPI migration, and presents the results to users as potential migration\nsolutions. To evaluate our approach, we migrate API calls in open source\nAndroid apps by learning API migration patterns from code examples. We find\nthat our approach can successfully learn API migration patterns and provide API\nmigration assistance in 71 out of 80 cases. Our approach can either migrate API\ncalls with little to no extra modifications needed or provide guidance to\nassist with the migrations.

However, it still remains a\nchallenging task in complex scenes, due to problems of light fluctuation,\nsimilar appearances of pigs, shape deformations and occlusions. To tackle these\nproblems, we propose a robust real time multiple pig detection and tracking\nmethod which does not require manual marking or physical identification of the\npigs, and works under both daylight and infrared light conditions. Our method\ncouples a CNN-based detector and a correlation filter-based tracker via a novel\nhierarchical data association algorithm. The detector gains the best\naccuracy/speed trade-off by using the features derived from multiple layers at\ndifferent scales in a one-stage prediction network. We define a tag-box for\neach pig as the tracking target, and the multiple object tracking is conducted\nin a key-points tracking manner using learned correlation filters. Under\nchallenging conditions, the tracking failures are modelled based on the\nrelations between responses of detector and tracker, and the data association\nalgorithm allows the detection hypotheses to be refined, meanwhile the drifted\ntracks can be corrected by probing the tracking failures followed by the\nre-initialization of tracking. As a result, the optimal tracklets can\nsequentially grow with on-line refined detections, and tracking fragments are\ncorrectly integrated into respective tracks while keeping the original\nidentifications. Experiments with a dataset captured from a commercial farm\nshow that our method can robustly detect and track multiple pigs under\nchallenging conditions. The promising performance of the proposed method also\ndemonstrates a feasibility of long-term individual pig tracking in a complex\nenvironment and thus promises a commercial potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2018 11:22:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-13"}

The uncertainties are handled in a worst-case sense,\ni.e. the worst possible material distribution over a given uncertainty set is\ntaken into account for each topology. The worst-case approach leads to a\nminimax problem, which is analyzed throughout the paper. A conservative convex\nrelaxation for the inner maximization problem is suggested, which allows to\ntreat the minimax problem by minimization of an optimal value function. A\nTikhonov type and a barrier regularization scheme are developed, which render\nthe resulting minimization problem continuously differentiable. The barrier\nregularization scheme turns out to be more suitable for the practical solution\nof the problem, as it can be closely linked to a highly efficient interior\npoint approach used for the evaluation of the optimal value function and its\ngradient. Based on this, the outer minimization problem can be approached by a\ngradient based optimization solver like the method of moving asymptotes.\nExamples from additive manufacturing as well as material degradation are\nexamined, demonstrating the practical applicability as well as the efficiency\nof the suggested method. Finally, the impact of the convex relaxation of the\ninner problem is investigated. It is observed that for large material\ndeviations, the robust solution may become too conservative.

To resolve this problem, we\npropose a new block called Concentrated-Comprehensive Convolution (C3) which\napplies the asymmetric convolutions before the depth-wise separable dilated\nconvolution to compensate for the information loss due to dilated convolution.\nThe C3 block consists of a concentration stage and a comprehensive convolution\nstage.

Then, in a\nsecond step, from a waveguide with zero transmission, we show how to build\ngeometries supporting trapped modes associated with eigenvalues embedded in the\ncontinuous spectrum. For this second construction, using the augmented\nscattering matrix and its unitarity, we play both with the geometry and the\nwavenumber. Finally, the mathematical analysis is supplemented by numerical\nillustrations of the results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2018 14:21:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-22"}

Phenomenological MWC\nand KNF models galvanized research for over five decades, and these models\ncontinue to be the basis for describing the allostery in an array of systems.\nHowever, understanding allosteric signaling and the associated dynamics between\ndistinct allosteric states is challenging. In this review, we first describe\nsymmetry and rigidity as essential requirements for allosteric proteins. The\ngeneral features, with MWC and KNF as two extreme scenarios, emerge when\nallosteric signaling is viewed from an energy landscape perspective. To go\nbeyond the general theories, we describe computational tools to predict the\nnetwork of residues that carry allosteric signals. Methods to obtain molecular\ninsights into the dynamics of allosteric transitions are briefly mentioned. The\nutility of the methods is illustrated by applications to systems ranging from\nmonomeric proteins to multisubunit proteins. Finally, the role allostery plays\nin the functions of ATP-consuming molecular machines, bacterial chaperonin\nGroEL and molecular motors, is described. Although universal molecular\nprinciples governing allosteric signaling do not exist, we can draw the\nfollowing general conclusions. (1) Multiple pathways connecting allosteric\nstates are highly heterogeneous. (2) Allosteric signaling is exquisitely\nsensitive to the architecture of the system, which implies that the capacity\nfor allostery is encoded in the structure itself.

In this paper, we discuss the limitations of coarse-grained\nprimitives and aim to provide an alternative for users to have flexible control\nover distributed programs and operate globally shared data more efficiently.

Methods: The presented method -\nWhoSGlAd - relies on Gram-Schmidt's orthogonalisation process. A Euclidean\nvector subspace of functions is defined and the oscillation frequencies are\nprojected over an orthonormal basis in a specific order. This allows the\nobtention of independent coefficients that we combine to define independent\nseismic indicators. Results: The developed method has been shown to be stable\nand to converge efficiently for solar-like pulsators. Thus, detailed and\nprecise inferences can be obtained on the mass, the age, the chemical\ncomposition and the undershooting in the interior of the studied stars.\nHowever, attention has to be paid when studying the helium glitch as there\nseems to be a degeneracy between the influence of the helium abundance and that\nof the heavy elements on the glitch amplitude. As an example, we analyse the\n16CygA (HD 186408) oscillation spectrum to provide an illustration of the\ncapabilities of the method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2018 15:11:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-06"}

Existing models proposed for causal\ninference using observational data from networks of interacting individuals\nhave two major shortcomings.

To correctly\nreproduce these data, an efficient transport mechanism is needed in addition to\nmeridional circulation and shear instability. Aims: We study the efficiency of\nthe transport of angular momentum during the subgiant phase. Results: The\nprecise asteroseismic measurements of both core and surface rotation rates\navailable for the six Kepler targets enable a precise determination of the\nefficiency of the transport of angular momentum needed for each of these\nsubgiants. These results are found to be insensitive to all the uncertainties\nrelated to the modelling of rotational effects before the post-main sequence\nphase. An interesting exception in this context is the case of young subgiants\n(typical values of log(g) close to 4), because their rotational properties are\nsensitive to the degree of radial differential rotation on the main sequence.\nThese young subgiants constitute therefore perfect targets to constrain the\ntransport of angular momentum on the main sequence from asteroseismic\nobservations of evolved stars. As for red giants, we find that the efficiency\nof the additional transport process increases with the mass of the star during\nthe subgiant phase. However, the efficiency of this undetermined mechanism\ndecreases with evolution during the subgiant phase, contrary to what is found\nfor red giants. Consequently, a transport process with an efficiency that\nincreases with the degree of radial differential rotation cannot account for\nthe core rotation rates of subgiants, while it correctly reproduces the\nrotation rates of red giant stars. This suggests that the physical nature of\nthe additional mechanism needed for the internal transport of angular momentum\nmay be different in subgiant and red giant stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2018 15:52:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-16"}

We retrieved\nmedical reports generated by Dicle University and implemented logistic\nregression to measure the model accuracy. We conducted (a) logistic\ncorrelation, (b) Omnibus test and (c) Hosmer and Lemeshow test for model\nevaluation. Moreover, we also developed association rules by confidence, rule\nsupport, lift, condition support and deployability. Categorical logistic\nregression increases the training accuracy from 72.30% to 81.40% with a testing\naccuracy of 63.46%. The study also shows the top 5 symptoms that is mostly\nlikely indicates the presence in MM. This study concludes that using predictive\nmodeling can enhance primary presentation and diagnosis of MM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 16:20:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Aug 2019 03:32:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-22"}

Accordingly, there is a pressing need for robust tools to\ndetect and classify Islamophobic hate speech at scale. Previous research has\nlargely approached the detection of Islamophobic hate speech on social media as\na binary task. However, the varied nature of Islamophobia means that this is\noften inappropriate for both theoretically-informed social science and\neffectively monitoring social media. Drawing on in-depth conceptual work we\nbuild a multi-class classifier which distinguishes between non-Islamophobic,\nweak Islamophobic and strong Islamophobic content. Accuracy is 77.6% and\nbalanced accuracy is 83%. We apply the classifier to a dataset of 109,488\ntweets produced by far right Twitter accounts during 2017. Whilst most tweets\nare not Islamophobic, weak Islamophobia is considerably more prevalent (36,963\ntweets) than strong (14,895 tweets). Our main input feature is a gloVe word\nembeddings model trained on a newly collected corpus of 140 million tweets. It\noutperforms a generic word embeddings model by 5.9 percentage points,\ndemonstrating the importan4ce of context. Unexpectedly, we also find that a\none-against-one multi class SVM outperforms a deep learning algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2018 10:34:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-27"}

To accomplish this, efficient power and resource allocation\nalgorithms need to be devised for the D2D users. Since the D2D users are\ntreated as secondary users, their interference to the cellular users (CUs)\nshould not hamper the CU communications. Most of the prior works on D2D\nresource allocation assume full channel state information (CSI) at the base\nstation (BS). However, the required channel gains for the D2D pairs may not be\nknown. To acquire these in a fast fading channel requires extra power and\ncontrol overhead. In this paper, we assume partial CSI and formulate the D2D\npower and resource allocation problem as a multi-armed bandit problem. We\npropose a power allocation scheme for the D2D users in which the BS allocates\npower to the D2D users if a certain signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio\n(SINR) is maintained for the CUs. In a single player environment a D2D user\nselects a CU in every time slot by employing UCB1 algorithm. Since this\nresource allocation problem can also be considered as an adversarial bandit\nproblem we have applied the exponential-weight algorithm for exploration and\nexploitation (Exp3) to solve it. In a multiple player environment, we extend\nUCB1 and Exp3 to multiple D2D users. We also propose two algorithms that are\nbased on distributed learning algorithm with fairness (DLF) and kth-UCB1\nalgorithms in which the D2D users are ranked. Our simulation results show that\nour proposed algorithms are fair and achieve good performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2018 13:00:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-01"}
