Current implementations rely on\nGaussian process regression, which provides coherent estimates of uncertainty\nneeded for the method but also suffers from drawbacks including poor scaling to\nlarge datasets and a reliance on fixed parametric kernels. In this paper, we\npropose a deep normative modeling framework based on neural processes (NPs) to\nsolve these problems. To achieve this, we define a stochastic process\nformulation for mixed-effect models and show how NPs can be adopted for\nspatially structured mixed-effect modeling of neuroimaging data. This enables\nus to learn optimal feature representations and covariance structure for the\nrandom-effect and noise via global latent variables. In this scheme, predictive\nuncertainty can be approximated by sampling from the distribution of these\nglobal latent variables. On a publicly available clinical fMRI dataset, we\ncompare the novelty detection performance of multivariate normative models\nestimated by the proposed NP approach to a baseline multi-task Gaussian process\nregression approach and show substantial improvements for certain diagnostic\nproblems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2018 16:02:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Apr 2019 13:18:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-16"}

The multiplicative difference can be eliminated by replacing\nmajority voting with the weighted voting scheme. In addition, we provide sharp\ntheoretical upper bounds of the number of subsamples in order for the\ndistributed nearest neighbor classifier to reach the optimal convergence rate.\nIt is interesting to note that the weighted voting scheme allows a larger\nnumber of subsamples than the majority voting one.

The solution includes the backreaction\non the breathing mode of the compactification space and on the vacuum energy,\nwhich yields a novel form of flattening. We establish the description of the\nsystem in terms of an effective 5d theory for the axion, and verify its\nvalidity in transplanckian regimes. In this context, rolling axion monodromy\nconfigurations with limited field space range would correspond, in the\nholographic dual field theory, to duality walls, which admit no embedding in\nstring theory so far.

A promising mechanism has been proposed by\nChandran et al. (2010), which in this paper we call \"magnetic moment breaking\"\n(MMB). As currently formulated, MMB dissipation operates only on the ion\nperpendicular motion, and does not influence their parallel temperature. Thus,\nthe MMB mechanism acting by itself produces coronal hole proton distributions\nthat are unstable to the ion-cyclotron anisotropy instability. This quasilinear\ninstability is expected to operate faster than the nonlinear turbulent cascade,\nscattering ions into the parallel direction and generating\nquasi-parallel-propagating ion-cyclotron (IC) waves. To investigate the\nconsequences of this instability on the MMB-heated protons, we construct a\nhomogeneous model for protons with coronal hole properties. Using a simplified\nversion of the resonant cyclotron interaction, we heat the protons by the MMB\nprocess and instantaneously scatter them to lower anisotropy while\nself-consistently generating parallel-propagating IC waves. We present several\nillustrative cases, finding that the extreme anisotropies implied by the MMB\nmechanism are limited to reasonable values, but the distinctive shape of the\nproton distribution derived by Klein & Chandran (2016) is not maintained. We\nalso find that these combined processes can result in somewhat higher particle\nenergization than the MMB heating alone. These quasilinear consequences should\nfollow from any kinetic mechanism that primarily increases the perpendicular\nion temperature in a collisionless plasma.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2018 16:46:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

As the actor network becomes more advanced, it can then take over\nto perform more complex actions, like obstacle avoidance. Eventually, the\nsimple controller can be discarded entirely.

We\nderive the most general Lorentz-violating ghost sector from BRST symmetry and\nrenormalization theory. We introduce a Lorentz-violating nonlinear gauge that\nsimplifies both the Higgs and gauge-sector extensions, which can be helpful in\nradiative corrections. At one loop, these sectors contribute to the $CPT$-even\npart of the photon propagator, characterized by the Riemann-type tensor\n$(k_F)_{\\alpha\\beta\\mu\\nu}$. We give exact results for the contributions to the\nSO(1,3) irreducible parts of $(k_F)_{\\alpha \\beta \\mu \\nu}$, namely, the\nWeyl-type tensor $(\\hat{k}_F)_{\\alpha \\beta \\mu \\nu}$, the Ricci-type tensor\n$(k_F)_{\\alpha \\beta}$, and the curvature-type scalar $k_F$. In the Yukawa\nsector, one-loop contributions are ultraviolet finite, but most of them are\nunobservable due to finite renormalization. The only observable effect is a\ncontribution proportional to $(k_F)_{\\alpha \\beta}$ that emerges via a\ndimension-6 term that is observer and gauge invariant. In the Higgs and gauge\nsectors, all the irreducible parts of the corresponding Riemann-type tensors\nreceive divergent contributions, so they are observable. The only finite\ncontribution corresponds to the dimension-6 term. We think of these\ncontributions as radiative corrections to the renormalized tensors and assume\nthat both effects are of the same order of magnitude to find bounds from vacuum\nbirefringence and compare with the literature.

We develop a simple\nphysical model for cloud formation and transport, efficient and versatile\nenough that it can be used in modular fashion for parameter optimization\nsearches of exoplanet atmosphere spectra. The transport equations are\nformulated in 1D, accounting for sedimentation and diffusion. The grain size is\nobtained through a moment method. For simplicity, only one cloud species is\nconsidered and the nucleation rate is parametrized. From the resulting physical\nprofiles we simulate transmission spectra covering the visual to mid-IR\nwavelength range. We apply our models towards KCl clouds in the atmosphere of\nGJ1214 b and towards MgSiO3 clouds of a canonical hot-Jupiter. We find that\nlarger cloud diffusivity $K_{zz}$ increases the thickness of the cloud, pushing\nthe $\\tau=1$ surface to a lower pressure layer higher in the atmosphere.

A theoretical model has\nbeen developed to understand the effect of interfacial viscosity on the lateral\nmigration of a droplet under the assumptions of no shape deformation and\nnegligible fluid inertia or thermal convection. Theoretical analysis is\nperformed under two limiting conditions: (i) when the transport of surfactants\nis dominated by surface-diffusion and (ii) when the transportation of\nsurfactants is dominated by surface-convection.

They deal with complex optimization\nproblems where standalone solvers exhibit varied performance. Among such a tool\nreside selection hyper-heuristics. By combining the strengths of each solver,\nthis kind of hyper-heuristic offers a more robust tool. However, their\neffectiveness is highly dependent on the 'features' used to link them with the\nproblem that is being solved. Aiming at enhancing selection hyper-heuristics,\nin this paper we propose two types of transformation: explicit and implicit.\nThe first one directly changes the distribution of critical points within the\nfeature domain while using a Euclidean distance to measure proximity. The\nsecond one operates indirectly by preserving the distribution of critical\npoints but changing the distance metric through a kernel function. We focus on\nanalyzing the effect of each kind of transformation, and of their combinations.\nWe test our ideas in the domain of constraint satisfaction problems because of\ntheir popularity and many practical applications. In this work, we compare the\nperformance of our proposals against those of previously published data.\nFurthermore, we expand on previous research by increasing the number of\nanalyzed features. We found that, by incorporating transformations into the\nmodel of selection hyper-heuristics, overall performance can be improved,\nyielding more stable results. However, combining implicit and explicit\ntransformations was not as fruitful. Additionally, we ran some confirmatory\ntests on the domain of knapsack problems. Again, we observed improved\nstability, leading to the generation of hyper-heuristics whose profit had a\nstandard deviation between 20% and 30% smaller.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2018 18:14:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-13"}

The hydraulic fracture model is based on\nthe poroelastic formulation of the displacement discontinuity method (DDM)\nwhich is a special formulation of the boundary element method (BEM). DDM is a\npowerful and efficient method for problems involving fractures. However, this\nmethod becomes slow as the number of temporal, or spatial elements increases,\nor necessary details such as poroelasticity, that makes the solution\nhistory-dependent, are added to the model. FMM is a technique to expedite\nmatrix-vector multiplications within a controllable error without forming the\nmatrix explicitly. Fully-coupled poroelastic formulation of DDM involves the\nmultiplication of a dense matrix with a vector in several places. A crucial\nmodification to DDM is suggested in two places in the algorithm to leverage the\nspeed efficiency of FMM for carrying out these multiplications. The first\nmodification is in the time-marching scheme, which accounts for the solution of\nprevious time steps to compute the current time step. The second modification\nis in the generalized minimal residual method (GMRES) to iteratively solve for\nthe problem unknowns. Several examples are provided to show the efficiency of\nthe proposed approach in problems with large degrees of freedom (in time and\nspace). Examples include hydraulic fracturing of a horizontal well and randomly\ndistributed pressurized fractures at different orientations with respect to\nhorizontal stresses. The results are compared to the conventional DDM in terms\nof computational processing time and accuracy. Accordingly, the proposed\nalgorithm may be used for fracture propagation studies while substantially\nreducing the processing time with a controllable error.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2018 18:51:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2019 18:24:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-23"}

In this strategy, jets in\nheavy-ion collisions ordered by $p_T$ are viewed as modified versions of the\nsame number of highest-energy jets in proton-proton collisions, and the\nfractional energy loss as a function of jet $p_T$ is a natural observable\n($Q_{\\rm AA}$).

It offers the possibility of investigating how low-mass,\nclose-in exoplanets evolve under the irradiation from their host stars. We\nobserved three transits of GJ 3470b in the Lyman-alpha line with the Hubble\nSpace Telescope (HST) as part of the Panchromatic Comparative Exoplanet\nTreasury (PanCET) program. Absorption signatures are detected with similar\nproperties in all three independent epochs, with absorption depths of 35+-7% in\nthe blue wing of the line, and 23+-5% in the red wing. The repeatability of\nthese signatures, their phasing with the planet transit, and the radial\nvelocity of the absorbing gas allow us to conclude that there is an extended\nupper atmosphere of neutral hydrogen around GJ 3470 b. We determine from our\nobservations the stellar radiation pressure and XUV irradiation from GJ 3470\nand use them to perform numerical simulations of the upper atmosphere of GJ\n3470b with the EVaporating Exoplanets (EVE) code. The unusual redshifted\nsignature can be explained by the damping wings of dense layers of neutral\nhydrogen that extend beyond the Roche lobe and are elongated in the direction\nof the planet motion. This structure could correspond to a shocked layer of\nplanetary material formed by the collision of the expanding thermosphere with\nthe wind of the star. The blueshifted signature is well explained by neutral\nhydrogen atoms escaping at rates of about 1e10 g s-1 that are blown away from\nthe star by its strong radiation pressure and are quickly photoionized,\nresulting in a smaller exosphere than that of the warm Neptune GJ 436b. The\nstronger escape from GJ 3470b, however, may have led to the loss of about 4-35%\nof its current mass over its 2 Gyr lifetime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2018 19:01:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-14"}

The Hall\nconductivity is of paramount importance in that its sign and magnitude directly\nreflect the sign of the charge carriers and the size of particle-hole asymmetry\neffects. Here we apply a strong-pairing fluctuation theory that incorporates\npseudogap effects known to be important in cuprate transport. As a result, in\nthe vicinity of the transition temperature our theoretical approach goes beyond\nthe conventional superconducting fluctuation formalism. In this regime,\npseudogap effects are evident in both the transverse and longitudinal\nconductivities and the bosonic response is explicitly gauge invariant. The\npresence of a gap in the excitation spectrum is also apparent at higher\ntemperatures, where the gapped fermionic quasiparticles are the dominant\ncontribution to the Hall coefficient. The observed non-monotonic temperature\ndependence of the Hall coefficient therefore results from a delicate interplay\nbetween the fermionic quasiparticles and the bosonic fluctuations. An important\nfeature of our work is that the sign of the Hall conductivity from the Cooper\npair fluctuations is the same as that of their fermionic constituents. Thus, we\nfind no sign change in the Hall coefficient above the transition temperature.\nThis prediction is corroborated by experiments, away from special charge\nordering stoichiometries. The theoretical results presented in this paper\nprovide crucial signatures that can be experimentally verified, enabling\nvalidation of the present theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2018 20:02:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-10"}

In the first part of the\nthesis we focus on hypothesis testing. We consider two main settings; one can\neither fix quantum states while optimizing over measurements or fix a\nmeasurement and evaluate its capability to discriminate by optimizing over\nstates. In the former setting, we prove a composite quantum Stein's Lemma. We\nalso discuss how this gives an operational interpretation to several quantities\nof interest. For the latter, we give the optimal asymptotic error rates in\nseveral symmetric and asymmetric settings, and discuss properties and examples\nof these rates.\n  In the second part, the focus is shifted to entropy inequalities. We start\nwith recoverability inequalities. Using tools developed to prove the composite\nStein's Lemma, we give a strengthened lower bound on the conditional quantum\nmutual information (CQMI). Next, we give an operational interpretation to the\nrelative entropy of recovery via hypothesis testing. Then, we discuss some\nrecent counterexamples, which show that the relative entropy of recovery is not\na lower bound on the CQMI; we provide more counterexamples where some systems\nare classical.\n  We then turn to a seemingly different type of entropy inequalities called\nbounds on information combining. Using a particular recoverability inequality,\nwe give a lower bound and additionally conjecture optimal lower and upper\nbounds. Furthermore, we discuss implications of our bounds to the finite\nblocklength behavior of Polar codes.\n  Finally, we discuss Renyi-$2$ entropy inequalities for Gaussian states, by\nexploiting their formulation as log-det inequalities to find recoverability\nrelated bounds on several quantities. We apply this to Gaussian steerability\nand entanglement measures, proving their monogamy and several other features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2018 20:09:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-14"}

Due to the closed nature of any\ncyclic graph, there is additional \"collision\"- like interference in the quantum\nrandom walk along with the usual interference in any such walk on any graph,\nclosed or otherwise. We find that the quantum walker remains localized in\ncomparison to the classical one, even in the absence of disorder, a phenomenon\nthat is potentially attributable to the additional interference in the quantum\ncase. This is to be contrasted with the situation on open graphs, where the\nquantum walker, being effectively denied the collision-like interference,\ngarners a much higher spread than its classical counterpart.

However, although a computer game is a type of software, the\nprocess to conceptualize, produce and deliver a game could involve unusual\nfeatures. In software testing, for instance, studies demonstrated the hesitance\nof professionals to use automated testing techniques with games, due to the\nconstant changes in requirements and design, and pointed out the need for\ncreating testing tools that take into account the flexibility required for the\ngame development process. Goal. This study aims to improve the current body of\nknowledge regarding software testing in game development and point out the\nexisting particularities observed in software testing considering the\ndevelopment of a computer game. Method. A mixed-method approach based on a case\nstudy and an opinion survey was applied to collect quantitative and qualitative\ndata from software professionals regarding the particularities of software\ntesting in game development. Results. We analyzed over 70 messages posted on\nthree well-established network of question-and-answer communities related to\nsoftware engineering, software testing and game development and received\nanswers of 38 professionals discussing differences between testing a computer\ngame and a general software, and identified important aspects to be observed by\npractitioners in the process of planning, performing and reporting tests in\nthis context.

These farmers often lack access to either cold storage or market\nforecasts. In particular, by having access to cold storage, farmers can store\ntheir produce for longer and thus have more flexibility as to when they should\nsell their harvest by. Meanwhile, by having access to market forecasts, farmers\ncan more easily identify which markets to sell at and when. While affordable\ncold storage solutions have become more widely available, there has been less\nwork on produce price forecasting. A key challenge is that in many regions of\nIndia, predominantly in rural and remote areas, we have either very limited or\nno produce pricing data available from public online sources.\n  In this paper, we present a produce price forecasting system that pulls data\nfrom the Indian Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare's website\nAgmarknet, trains a model of prices using over a thousand markets, and displays\ninterpretable price forecasts in a web application viewable from a mobile\nphone. Due to the pricing data being extremely sparse, our method first imputes\nmissing entries using collaborative filtering to obtain a dense dataset. Using\nthis imputed dense dataset, we then train a decision-tree-based classifier to\npredict produce prices at different markets. In terms of interpretability, we\ndisplay the most relevant historical pricing data that drive each forecasted\nprice, where we take advantage of the fact that a wide family of\ndecision-tree-based ensemble learning methods are adaptive nearest neighbor\nmethods. We show how to construct heuristic price uncertainty intervals based\non nearest neighbors. We validate forecast accuracy on data from Agmarknet and\na small field survey of a few markets in Odisha.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2018 22:00:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-14"}

Therefore, we conclude that\nthe QHA-based approach employed by Nelson et al. cannot be applied reliably to\nthe study of phase boundaries involving superionic phases. This conclusion is\nfurther corroborated by additional ab initio calculations performed in the\nsuperionic compounds SrF$_{2}$, BaF$_{2}$, Li$_{3}$OCl, and AgI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2018 22:22:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-19"}

By combining the\nprotocol with newly developed MEMS-based sensors (i.e. Membrane-type Surface\nstress Sensors (MSS)), we have realized the gas identification with the\nfree-hand measurement, in which one can simply hold a small sensor chip near\nsamples. From sensing signals obtained through the free-hand measurement, we\nhave developed machine learning models that can identify not only solvent\nvapors but also odors of spices and herbs with high accuracies. Since no bulky\ngas flow control units are required, this protocol will expand the\napplicability of gas sensors to portable electronics and wearable devices,\nleading to practical artificial olfaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2018 23:27:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-24"}

An approach widely adopted in\nthe literature to reduce the excess of UV radiation consists of artificially\nincreasing the continuum opacity by using multiplicative fudge factors, which\nare empirically derived to impose the synthetized spectrum to match the\nobserved one. Although the method was initially developed to improve non-LTE\nsynthesis of spectral lines, it has been recently employed to model solar\nspectral irradiance variability. Such irradiance reconstruction techniques\ncombine spectral synthesis of different types of structures, which are\nperformed making use of factors derived from a reference, quiet Sun model.\nBecause the opacity scales in a complex way with plasma physical properties,\nthe question arises whether, and to what extent, fudge factors derived using a\nreference model can be used to adjust the opacity of models representing\ndifferent types of quiet and magnetic features. Here we investigate the effects\nof opacity fudging on estimates of solar and stellar irradiance variability in\nUV bands. We find that the use of fudge factors might underestimate the\nvariability by 19% and up to 20% in the ranges 230-300 nm and 300-400 nm,\nrespectively. These estimates are model dependent and should be considered as\nupper limits. Finally, our analysis suggests the uncertainties generated by the\nuse of fudge factors to increase with the decrease of stellar metallicity and\nto be significant for stars whose variability is facula-dominated and whose\neffective temperature is larger than approximately 4000 K.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2018 00:02:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

Most of the previous methods\nmodeled the probability distribution in the whole sample space.

In this paper, with the insight that the distribution in a\nlocal sample space should be simpler than that in the whole sample space, a\nlocal probabilistic model established for a local region is expected much\nsimpler and can relax the fundamental assumptions that may not be true in the\nwhole sample space. Based on these advantages we propose establishing local\nprobabilistic models for Bayesian classification. In addition, a Bayesian\nclassifier adopting a local probabilistic model can even be viewed as a\ngeneralized local classification model; by tuning the size of the local region\nand the corresponding local model assumption, a fitting model can be\nestablished for a particular classification problem.

Many studies have reported that the solution set\nof an M-objective optimization problem often forms an (M-1)-dimensional\ntopological simplex (a curved line for M=2, a curved triangle for M=3, a curved\ntetrahedron for M=4, etc.). Since the dimensionality of the solution set\nincreases as the number of objectives grows, an exponentially large sample size\nis needed to cover the solution set.

To circumvent this problem, we\nconstruct a pose-oblivious shape signature which is fed to a sequence learning\nframework. The pose signature representation is done in two-fold process.\nFirst, we represent person-pose in first frame of a dance video using symmetric\nSpatial Transformer Networks (STN) to extract good person object proposals and\nCNN-based parallel single person pose estimator (SPPE). Next, the pose basis\nare converted to pose flows by assigning a similarity score between successive\nposes followed by non-maximal suppression. Instead of feeding a simple chain of\njoints in the sequence learner which generally hinders the network performance\nwe constitute a feature vector of the normalized distance vectors, flow, angles\nbetween anchor joints which captures the adjacency configuration in the\nskeletal pattern.

The highly excited planetesimals\ngenerate bow shocks, the mechanism of which results in chondrule formation,\ncrystallization of silicate dust, and evaporation of icy planetesimals. The\nplanetesimals beyond 2:1 resonance migrate owing to the gas drag and obtain the\nmaximum eccentricity around 3:1 resonance, which is located at approximately\nhalf the planetary distance. The eccentricity depends on the parameters of the\nplanetesimals and the Jovian planet, such as size and location, and gas density\nof the disk. The maximum relative velocity of a 100-km-sized planetesimal with\nrespect to the gas disk reaches up to ~12 km/s in the case of Jupiter owing to\nsecular resonance, which occurs because of the disk's gravity. We find that if\na Jovian mass planet is located within 10 au, the planetesimals larger than 100\nkm gain sufficient velocity to cause the melting of chondrule precursors and\ncrystallization of the silicate. The maximum velocity is higher for large\nplanetesimals and eccentric planets. Planetesimals are trapped temporarily in\nthe resonances and continue to have high speed over >1 Myr after the formation\nof a Jovian planet. This duration fits into the timescale of chondrule\nformation suggested by the isotopic data. The evaporation of icy planetesimals\noccurs when a Jovian planet is located within 15 au. This mechanism can be a\nnew indicator of planet formation in exosystems if some molecules ejected from\nicy planetesimals are detected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2018 03:31:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-14"}

Investigating the critical\nregularization strength, we discuss strong correlation in C$_{20}$ at the\nJahn-Teller distorted geometries (C$_\\text{2h}$, D$_\\text{2h}$, C$_\\text{i}$,\nand D$_\\text{3h}$) and the I$_\\text{h}$ geometry. Only C$_{20}$ (I$_\\text{h}$)\nwas found to be strongly correlated while others exhibit {\\it artificial} HF\nsymmetry breaking. This analysis highlights a useful feature of the recommended\n$\\kappa$-OOMP2 method. It is an electronic structure method that describes\ndynamic correlation, and attenuates strong correlation in MP2 towards zero by\nregularization. Therefore, $\\kappa$-OOMP2 will exhibit symmetry breaking in its\nreference determinant only when correlation is strong (i.e., essential symmetry\nbreaking). Artificial symmetry breaking (arising in HF due to neglect of\ndynamic correlation) is thus removed in $\\kappa$-OOMP2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2018 05:11:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

We outline, from\nhigh-resolution powder x-ray diffraction measurements, a corrected\nroom-temperature crystal structure to that previously proposed and uncover a\nstructural transition at 79 K, also seen in the heat capacity. Magnetization\nmeasurements confirm VI$_3$ to be a hard ferromagnet (9.1 kOe coercive field at\n2 K) with a high degree of anisotropy, and the pressure dependence of the\nmagnetic properties provide evidence for the two-dimensional nature of the\nmagnetic order. Optical and electrical transport measurements show this\nmaterial to be an insulator with an optical band gap of 0.67 eV - the previous\ntheoretical predictions of d-band metallicity then lead us to believe VI$_3$ to\nbe a correlated Mott insulator. Our latest band structure calculations support\nthis picture and show good agreement with the experimental data.

In this paper, a comprehensive framework is proposed to thwart cyber\nand physical attacks on ACV networks. First, an optimal safe controller for\nACVs is derived to maximize the street traffic flow while minimizing the risk\nof accidents by optimizing ACV speed and inter-ACV spacing. It is proven that\nthe proposed controller is robust to physical attacks which aim at making ACV\nsystems instable. To improve the cyber-physical security of ACV systems, next,\ndata injection attack (DIA) detection approaches are proposed to address cyber\nattacks on sensors and their physical impact on the ACV system. To\ncomprehensively design the DIA detection approaches, ACV sensors are\ncharacterized in two subsets based on the availability of a-priori information\nabout their data. For sensors having a prior information, a DIA detection\napproach is proposed and an optimal threshold level is derived for the\ndifference between the actual and estimated values of sensors data which\nenables ACV to stay robust against cyber attacks. For sensors having no prior\ninformation, a novel multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithm is proposed to enable\nACV to securely control its motion. Simulation results show that the proposed\noptimal safe controller outperforms current state of the art controllers by\nmaximizing the robustness of ACVs to physical attacks. The results also show\nthat the proposed DIA detection approaches, compared to Kalman filtering, can\nimprove the security of ACV sensors against cyber attacks and ultimately\nimprove the physical robustness of an ACV system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2018 07:36:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-14"}

We give a generalization of the\nk-fold Zappa-Szep product of cyclic groups, which we call OGS decomposition. It\nis easy to see that existence of an OGS decomposition for all the composition\nfactors of a non-abelian group G implies the existence of an OGS for G itself.\nSince the composition factors of a soluble group are cyclic groups, it\nobviously has an OGS decomposition. Therefore, the question of the existence of\nan OGS decomposition is interesting for non-soluble groups. The Jordan-Holder\nTheorem motivates us to consider an existence of an OGS decomposition for the\nfinite simple groups. In 1993, Holt and Rowley showed that PSL_{2}(q) and\nPSL_{3}(q) can be expressed as a product of cyclic groups. In this paper, we\nconsider an OGS decomposition of PSL_{2}(q) from a point of view different than\nthat of Holt and Rowley. We look at its connection to the BN-pair decomposition\nof the group.

To improve the\nspectrum efficiency in conventional CoMAC, we propose the use of non-orthogonal\nmultiple access (NOMA) for functions in CoMAC.

It was only until recently that some preliminary progress\nwas made in testing feed-forward DL systems. In contrast to feed-forward DL\nsystems, recurrent neural networks (RNN) follow a very different architectural\ndesign, implementing temporal behaviors and memory with loops and internal\nstates. Such stateful nature of RNN contributes to its success in handling\nsequential inputs such as audio, natural languages and video processing, but\nalso poses new challenges for quality assurance.\n  In this paper, we initiate the very first step towards testing RNN-based\nstateful DL systems. We model RNN as an abstract state transition system, based\non which we define a set of test coverage criteria specialized for stateful DL\nsystems. Moreover, we propose an automated testing framework, DeepCruiser,\nwhich systematically generates tests in large scale to uncover defects of\nstateful DL systems with coverage guidance.

We introduce a new\nstatistic $S_P^O(z)\\equiv \\frac{\\Delta O}{\\Delta P}(z) \\cdot V_{eff}^{1/2}$,\nincluding the effective survey volume $V_{eff}$, as a measure of the\nconstraining power of a given observable $O$ with respect to a cosmological\nparameter $P$ as a function of redshift $z$. We find blind redshift spots $z_b$\n($S_P^O(z_b)\\simeq 0$) and optimal redshift spots $z_s$ ($S_P^O(z_s)\\simeq\nmax$) for these observables with respect to the parameters $\\Omega_m$, $w$ and\n$g_a$. For $O=f\\sigma_8$ and $P=(\\Omega_{m},w,g_a)$ we find blind spots at\n$z_b\\simeq(1,2,2.7)$ respectively and optimal (sweet) spots at\n$z_s=(0.5,0.8,1.2)$. Thus probing higher redshifts may be less effective than\nprobing lower redshifts with higher accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2018 10:53:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 5 May 2019 13:20:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-07"}

However, when\napps do not have identical sets of privileges inter-app communication (IAC) can\naccidentally or maliciously be misused, e.g., to leak sensitive information\ncontrary to users expectations. Recent research considered static program\nanalysis to detect dangerous data leaks due to inter-component communication\n(ICC) or IAC, but suffers from shortcomings with respect to precision,\nsoundness, and scalability. To solve these issues we propose a novel approach\nfor static ICC/IAC analysis. We perform a fixed-point iteration of ICC/IAC\nsummary information to precisely resolve intent communication with more than\ntwo apps involved. We integrate these results with information flows generated\nby a baseline (i.e. not considering intents) information flow analysis, and\nresolve if sensitive data is flowing (transitively) through components/apps in\norder to be ultimately leaked. Our main contribution is the first fully\nautomatic sound and precise ICC/IAC information flow analysis that is scalable\nfor realistic apps due to modularity, avoiding combinatorial explosion: Our\napproach determines communicating apps using short summaries rather than\ninlining intent calls, which often requires simultaneously analyzing all tuples\nof apps. We evaluated our tool IIFA in terms of scalability, precision, and\nrecall. Using benchmarks we establish that precision and recall of our\nalgorithm are considerably better than prominent state-of-the-art analyses for\nIAC. But foremost, applied to the 90 most popular applications from the Google\nPlaystore, IIFA demonstrated its scalability to a large corpus of real-world\napps.

In the\nrecent paper arXiv:1801.09703, we demonstrated that these two mechanisms can be\nfactorized from each other within a controlled, \"double-logarithmic\"\napproximation in perturbative QCD. In this proceeding we recall the main\nfeatures of the jet evolution in a dense QCD medium. We emphasize that the\nin-medium parton showers differ from those in the vacuum in two crucial\naspects: their phase-space is reduced and the first emission outside the medium\ncan violate angular ordering. Based on this factorized picture, which is\nMarkovian, we have recently developed a Monte Carlo event generator which\nincludes both vacuum-like and medium-induced emissions and goes beyond the\ndouble logarithmic approximation. We here present our first results for the\nfragmentation function and the energy loss by the jet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2018 12:50:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-14"}

To tackle\nthe above challenges, we design an adversarial learning model named\nreader-aware summary generator (RASG), which consists of four components: (1) a\nsequence-to-sequence based summary generator; (2) a reader attention module\ncapturing the reader focused aspects; (3) a supervisor modeling the semantic\ngap between the generated summary and reader focused aspects; (4) a goal\ntracker producing the goal for each generation step.

Our analysis shows that the solar wind conditions in\nthe 30 minutes interval around the arrival of fast-forward shocks have a\nsignificant contribution to the prediction of long-duration southward B$_{z}$\nperiods. This probabilistic model may provide on average a 14-hour warning time\nfor an intense and long-duration southward B$_{z}$ period. Evaluating the\nforecast capability of the model through a statistical and skill score-based\napproach reveals that it outperforms a coin-flipping forecast. By using the\ninformation provided by the arrival of a fast-forward shock at L1, this model\nrepresents a marked improvement over similar forecasting methods. We outline a\nnumber of future potential improvements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2018 13:42:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-14"}

The detector operates in a surface building, with\nmodest shielding, and relies on extremely efficient online rejection of\nbackgrounds in order to identify these interactions. A novel detector design\nhas been developed using 12800 5 cm cubes for high segmentation. Each cube is\nformed of a sandwich of two scintillators, PVT and 6LiF:ZnS(Ag), allowing the\ndetection and identification of positrons and neutrons respectively.

The system uses a\ncombination of high price-performance FPGAs with a gigabit Ethernet based\nreadout system, and its total power consumption is under 1 kW. The use of zero\nsuppression techniques, combined with pulse shape discrimination trigger\nalgorithms to detect neutrons, results in an online data reduction factor of\naround 10000. The neutron trigger is combined with a large per-channel history\ntime buffer, allowing for unbiased positron detection.

Stabilization in time and space directions are performed\nsimilarly, which allow us to use high-order discretizations in time without any\nCFL-like condition. The method is proven to yield solutions that satisfy the\ndiscrete maximum principle (DMP) unconditionally for arbitrary order. In\naddition, the stabilization is linearity preserving in a space-time sense.\nMoreover, the scheme is proven to be Lipschitz continuous ensuring that the\nnonlinear problem is well-posed. Solving large problems using a space-time\ndiscretization can become highly costly.

In the first step, a generator that creates hard\nexample candidates is learned via the adversarial learning framework by fooling\na discriminator and a pixel-wise classification model at the same time. In the\nsecond step, mining is performed to build a fixed number of hard examples from\na large pool of real and artificially generated examples. To evaluate the\neffectiveness of the proposed HEG approach, we design a 9-layer fully\nconvolutional network suitable for pixel-wise classification. Experiments show\nthat using generated hard examples from the proposed HEG approach improves the\npixel-wise classification model's accuracy on red tide detection and\nhyperspectral image classification tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2018 14:29:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Apr 2019 13:16:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2022 10:13:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-08"}

Kotzig,\nLov\\'asz and Plummer developed a decomposition theory for graphs with perfect\nmatchings and their corresponding polytopes known as the tight cut\ndecomposition which breaks down every graph into a number of indecomposable\ngraphs, so called bricks. For many properties that are of interest on graphs\nwith perfect matchings, including the description of the perfect matching\npolytope, it suffices to consider these bricks. A key result by Lov\\'asz on the\ntight cut decomposition is that the list of bricks obtained is the same\nindependent of the choice of tight cuts made during the tight cut decomposition\nprocedure. This implies that finding a tight cut decomposition is polynomial\ntime equivalent to finding a single tight cut.\n  We generalise the notions of a tight cut, a tight cut contraction and a tight\ncut decomposition to hypergraphs. By providing an example, we show that the\noutcome of the tight cut decomposition on general hypergraphs is no longer\nunique. However, we are able to prove that the uniqueness of the tight cut\ndecomposition is preserved on a slight generalisation of uniform hypergraphs.\nMoreover, we show how the tight cut decomposition leads to a decomposition of\nthe perfect matching polytope of uniformable hypergraphs and that the\nrecognition problem for tight cuts in uniformable hypergraphs is polynomial\ntime solvable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2018 14:43:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Feb 2019 09:43:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 28 Feb 2019 11:53:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-01"}

Local embedding, which\ninvolves only the occupied sector, has previously been employed in the context\nof Co/graphene. Here, the methodology is extended in order to allow for\neffective downfolding of the virtual sector thus allowing for significant\nreduction in the computational effort required for AFQMC calculations. The\nsystem size which can be feasibly treated with AFQMC is therefore greatly\nextended as only a single local cluster is explicitly correlated at the AFQMC\nlevel of theory. The approximation is controlled by the separate choice of the\nspatial size of the active occupied region, $R_o$, and of the active virtual\nregion, $R_v$. The systematic dependence of the AFQMC energy on $R_o$ and $R_v$\nis investigated and it is found that relative AFQMC energies of physical and\nchemical interest converge rapidly to the full AFQMC treatment (i.e. using no\nembedding or downfolding).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2018 15:08:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-24"}

Our scheme provides long\nterm predictions (two seconds or more) for both the body pose and its absolute\nposition. Our approach builds upon three main contributions. First, we\nrepresent the data using a spatio-temporal tensor of 3D skeleton coordinates\nwhich allows formulating the prediction problem as an inpainting one, for which\nGANs work particularly well. Secondly, we design an architecture to learn the\njoint distribution of body poses and global motion, capable to hypothesize\nlarge chunks of the input 3D tensor with missing data.

A number of methods have been\nproposed that do not rely on weight symmetry but, thus far, these have failed\nto scale to deep convolutional networks and complex data. We identify principal\nobstacles to the scalability of such algorithms and introduce several\ntechniques to mitigate them. We demonstrate that a modification of the feedback\nalignment method that enforces a weaker form of weight symmetry, one that\nrequires agreement of weight sign but not magnitude, can achieve performance\ncompetitive with backpropagation. Our results complement those of Bartunov et\nal. (2018) and Xiao et al. (2018b) and suggest that mechanisms that promote\nalignment of feedforward and feedback weights are critical for learning in deep\nnetworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2018 22:12:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Jun 2019 04:19:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-11"}

Fundamental challenges for\nRSS DFL methods include having a model of RSS measurements as a function of a\nperson's location, and maintaining an accurate model as the environment changes\nover time. Current methods rely on either labeled empty-area calibration or\nlabeled fingerprints with a person at each location. Both need to be frequently\nrecalibrated or retrained to stay current with changing environments. Other DFL\nmethods only localize people in motion.
