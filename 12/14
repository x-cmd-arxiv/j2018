The fragmentation of diffuse\nmolecular cloud into stars is subject to physical processes such as gravity,\nturbulence, thermal pressure, and magnetic field. The final mass of a star is\nbelieved to be a combined outcome of a virially unstable reservoir and\nsubsequent accretion. We aim to clarify the roles of different supporting\nenergies, notably the thermal pressure and the magnetic field, in determining\nthe stellar mass. Following previous studies by Lee & Hennebelle (2018a,b), we\nperform a series of numerical experiments of stellar cluster formation inside\nan isolated molecular clump. By changing the effective equation of state (EOS)\nof the diffuse gas (that is to say gas whose density is below the critical\ndensity at which dust becomes opaque to its radiation) and the strength of the\nmagnetic field, we investigate whether any characteristic mass is introduced\ninto the fragmentation processes. The EOS of the diffuse gas, including the\nbulk temperature and the polytropic index, does not affect significantly the\nshape of the stellar mass spectrum. The presence of magnetic field slightly\nmodifies the shape of the mass spectrum only when extreme values are applied.\nThis study confirms that the peak of the IMF is primarily determined by the\nadiabatic high-density end of the EOS that mimics the radiation inside the\nhigh-density gas. Furthermore, the shape of the mass spectrum is mostly\nsensitive to the density PDF, and the magnetic field has likely only a\nsecondary role. In particular, we stress that the Jeans mass at the mean cloud\ndensity and at the critical density are not responsible of setting the peak.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2018 16:32:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-13"}

Since the coefficients in the arising\nexpansions are often of cumbersome structure or not explicitly available, such\nconsiderations are generally very nontrivial. In 1970, G.

Rotation is suspected to be the cause of\nthis feature, by accumulating fast rotating stars, strongly affected by gravity\ndarkening and rotation-induced mixing, near the MS turn-off. This scenario\nsuccessfully reproduces the tight relation between the age and the actual\nextent in luminosity of the extended MS turn-off of observed clusters. Below a\ngiven mass (dependent on the metallicity), stars are efficiently braked early\non the MS due to the interaction of stellar winds and the surface magnetic\nfield, making their tracks converge towards those of non-rotating tracks in the\nHRD. When these stars are located at the turn-off of a cluster, their slow\nrotation causes the extended MS turn-off feature to disappear. We investigate\nthe maximal mass for which this braking occurs at different metallicities, and\ndetermine the age above which no extended MS turn-off is expected in clusters.\nOur models predict that the extended MS turn-off phenomenon disappears at ages\nolder than about 2 Gyr.

A lot of consumer IoT devices have little to no\nsecurity implementation at all, thus risking user's privacy and making them\ntarget of mass cyber-attacks. Indeed, recent outbreak of Mirai botnet and its\nvariants have already proved the lack of security on the IoT world. Hence, it\nis important to understand the security issues and attack vectors in the IoT\ndomain. Though significant research has been done to secure traditional\ncomputing systems, little focus was given to the IoT realm. In this work, we\nreduce this gap by developing a honeypot framework for IoT devices.\nSpecifically, we introduce U-PoT: a novel honeypot framework for capturing\nattacks on IoT devices that use Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) protocol. A\nmyriad of smart home devices including smart switches, smart bulbs,\nsurveillance cameras, smart hubs, etc. uses the UPnP protocol. Indeed, a simple\nsearch on Shodan IoT search engine lists 1,676,591 UPnP devices that are\nexposed to public network. The popularity and ubiquitous nature of UPnP-based\nIoT device necessitates a full-fledged IoT honeypot system for UPnP devices.\nOur novel framework automatically creates a honeypot from UPnP device\ndescription documents and is extendable to any device types or vendors that use\nUPnP for communication. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work\ntowards a flexible and configurable honeypot framework for UPnP-based IoT\ndevices. We released U-PoT under an open source license for further research\nand created a database of UPnP device descriptions. We also evaluated our\nframework on two emulated deices. Our experiments show that the emulated\ndevices are able to mimic the behavior of a real IoT device and trick\nvendor-provided device management applications or popular IoT search engines\nwhile having minimal performance ovherhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2018 18:17:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-14"}

Exposures to\ndiscriminatory expletives or negative critiques from their male colleagues may\nfurther exacerbate those feelings. Aims: The primary goal of this study is to\nidentify the differences in expressions of sentiments between male and female\ndevelopers during various software engineering tasks. Method: On this goal, we\nmined the code review repositories of six popular open source projects. We used\na semi-automated approach leveraging the name as well as multiple social\nnetworks to identify the gender of a developer. Using SentiSE, a customized and\nstate-of-the-art sentiment analysis tool for the software engineering domain,\nwe classify each communication as negative, positive, or neutral. We also\ncompute the frequencies of sentiment words, emoticons, and expletives used by\neach developer. Results: Our results suggest that the likelihood of using\nsentiment words, emoticons, and expletives during code reviews varies based on\nthe gender of a developer, as females are significantly less likely to express\nsentiments than males. Although female developers were more neutral to their\nmale colleagues than to another female, male developers from three out of the\nsix projects were not only writing more frequent negative comments but also\nwithholding positive encouragements from their female counterparts. Conclusion:\nOur results provide empirical evidence of another factor behind the negative\nwork place experiences encountered by the female developers that may be\ncontributing to the diminishing number of females in the SE industry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2018 18:20:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-14"}

The giant planet occurrence rates for Kepler and RV show the same\nrising trend with increasing distance from the star. We identify a break in the\nRV giant planet distribution between ~2-3 au -- close to the location of the\nsnow line in the Solar System -- after which the occurrence rate decreases with\ndistance from the star.

Developing a sound\nmathematical framework to model initially stressed solids in nonlinear\nelasticity is key for many applications in engineering and biology. This work\ninvestigates the links between the existence of elastic minimizers and the\nconstitutive restrictions for initially stressed materials subjected to finite\ndeformations. In particular, we consider a subclass of constitutive responses\nin which the strain energy density is taken as a scalar valued function of both\nthe deformation gradient and the initial stress tensor. The main advantage of\nthis approach is that the initial stress tensor belongs to the group of the\ndivergence-free symmetric tensors satisfying the boundary condition in any\ngiven reference configuration. However, it is still unclear which physical\nrestrictions must be imposed for the well-posedness of this elastic problem.\nAssuming that the constitutive response depends on the choice of the reference\nconfiguration only through the initial stress tensor, under given conditions we\nprove the local existence of a relaxed state given by an implicit tensor\nfunction of the initial stress distribution. This tensor function is generally\nnot unique, and can be transformed accordingly to the symmetry group of the\nmaterial at fixed initial stresses. These results allow to extend Ball's\nexistence theorem of elastic minimizers for the proposed constitutive choice of\ninitially stressed materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2018 18:51:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}

For\neach galaxy we derive, using CIGALE and the SED+LIR fitting technique, the\nslope of the dust attenuation curve and the strength of the UV bump, plus many\nother galaxy parameters. We find that the IRX-beta scatter is driven entirely\nby a wide range of attenuation curves - primarily their slopes. Once the slope\nand the UV bump are fixed, the scatter in the IRX-beta vanishes. The question\nof the IRX-beta scatter is the direct manifestation of a more fundamental\nquestion of the diversity of dust attenuation curves. The predominant role of\nthe attenuation curve is the consequence of a narrow range of intrinsic UV\nslopes of star-forming galaxies. Galaxies with different specific SFRs or\npopulation ages do not show strong trends in the IRX-beta diagram because their\nattenuation curves are, on average, similar. Similarly, there is no shift in\nthe IRX-beta locus between starbursts and normal star-forming galaxies, both\ntypes having, on average, steep attenuation curves. Optical opacity is\nidentified as the strongest determinant of the attenuation curve slope, and\nconsequently the IRX-beta diversity. Despite the scatter, the use of an average\nIRX-beta relation is justified to correct SFRs, adding a random error of <~0.15\ndex. The form of the local correspondence between IRX-beta and attenuation\ncurves is maintained at high redshift as long as the evolution of the intrinsic\nUV slopes stays within a few tenths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2018 19:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-13"}

We\nfind that jellyfish galaxies seem to be preferentially located near a boundary\ninside each subcluster where diffuse gas moving along with the subcluster and\ndiffuse gas from the remainder of the system meet. The velocity change in those\nboundaries is such that a factor of up to $\\sim$1000 increase in the ram\npressure takes place within a few hundred kpc, which could trigger the high\nrate of gas loss necessary for a jellyfish morphology to emerge. A theoretical\ntreatment of ram pressure stripping in the environment of galaxy cluster\nmergers has not been presented in the literature so far; we propose that this\ncould be a common scenario for the formation of jellyfish morphologies in such\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2018 19:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-26"}

In particular, Lidov-Kozai (LK) oscillations of orbital\neccentricity/inclination induced by a distant planetary or stellar companion,\ncombined with tidal friction, have been shown to produce HJs on Gyr timescales,\nprovided that efficient tidal dissipation operates in the planet. We re-examine\nthis scenario with the inclusion of dynamical tides. When the planet's orbit is\nin a high-eccentricity phase, the tidal force from the star excites oscillatory\nf-modes and r-modes in the planet. For sufficiently large eccentricity and\nsmall pericentre distance, the mode can grow chaotically over multiple\npericentre passages and eventually dissipate non-linearly, drawing energy from\nthe orbit and rapidly shrinking the semi-major axis. We study the effect of\nsuch chaotic tides on the planet's orbital evolution. We find that this pathway\nproduces very eccentric ($e\\gtrsim 0.9$) warm Jupiters (WJs) on short\ntimescales (a few to 100 Myrs). These WJs efficiently circularize to become HJs\ndue to their persistently small pericentre distances. Chaotic tides can also\nsave some planets from tidal disruption by truncating the LK eccentricity\noscillations, significantly increasing the HJ formation fraction for a range of\nplanet masses and radii. Using a population synthesis calculation, we determine\nthe characteristics of WJs and HJs produced in this scenario, including the\nfinal period distribution, orbital inclinations and stellar obliquities.\nChaotic tides endow LK migration with several favorable features to explain\nobservations of HJs.

By contrast, turning\noff the phase string induced by the hole hopping in the so-called $\\sigma\\cdot\nt\\text{-}J$ model, a conventional Bloch-wave wave function with a finite\nquasiparticle spectral weight can be recovered, also in agreement with the ED\nand DMRG results. The present study shows that a singular effect already takes\nplace in the single-hole-doped Mott insulator, by which the bare hole is turned\ninto a non-Landau quasiparticle with translational symmetry breaking.\nGeneralizations to pairing and finite doping are briefly discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2018 19:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Jul 2019 14:10:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-04"}

This suggests\nnear-horizon Carroll symmetry may have a role to play in explaining black hole\nLove numbers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2018 19:22:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Jan 2019 17:33:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-09"}

For large enough domain sizes, $L_y\n\\gtrsim 60H$, the disc settles down into a quasi-steady state, showing no long\nterm trends in properties or variation with box size. For smaller boxes, we\nfind that the azimuthal wavelength of the dominant spiral modes are limited to\nthe domain size. This is associated with a bursty behaviour that differs from\nthe quasi-steady dynamics at larger sizes. We point out that a similar\ntransition may be expected in global simulations at the point where the range\nof azimuthal wavelengths is limited by the finite disc size. This condition\n(i.e. when $60 H \\sim 2 \\pi R$, i.e. $H/R \\sim 0.1$) correctly predicts the\ntransition to bursty behaviour previously found in global simulations for\ndisc-to-star mass ratios in excess of 0.25. We recover a transition in the\ndynamics from two- to three-dimensional behaviour, characterized by a\nturbulence that becomes more isotropic on small scales. This turbulence likely\nplays an important role in the evolution of dust in self-gravitating discs,\npotentially dominating the collision velocity for particles with Stokes number\n$< 1$. Finally, we consider the stability of gravito-turbulence against\nfragmentation, finding that discs which cool faster than a few dynamical times\nfragment immediately, supporting previous results. We also find hints of\nstochastic fragmentation at marginally longer cooling times, in which a\nfragment forms from a quasi-equilibrium state. However, this makes little\npractical difference to region where planet formation via gravitational\ninstability may occur.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2018 19:26:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-26"}

This distortion drives dislocation activity\nresulting in an observable macroscopic Transformation-Induced Plastic (TRIP)\ndeformation, which occurs at effective stress levels much lower than the\nplastic yield limit of the material.

However, such assumption may not be proper in the\npresence of geometric discontinuities, such as cracks, and repeated cycling\nloading that has been reported to induce irrecoverable strains up to 20% due to\ntransformation induced plasticity. In addition to finite strains, SMA-based\ndevices may also undergo large rotations.

For low-dimensional elliptical models, efficient moment\nestimators can be obtained by plugging in an estimate of the precision matrix.\nNatural generalizations of the plug-in estimator to high-dimensional settings\nperform unsatisfactorily, due to estimating a large precision matrix.

Because of the\nhigh actuation energy density of SMAs, compared to other active materials,\nstructures integrated with SMA-based actuators has high advantage in terms of\ntrade-offs between overall structure weight, integrity and functionality. The\nmajority of available constitutive models for SMAs are developed within the\ninfinitesimal strain regime. However, it was reported that particular SMAs can\ngenerate transformation strains nearly up to 8%-10%, for which the adopted\ninfinitesimal strain assumption is no longer appropriate. Furthermore, industry\napplications may require SMA actuators undergo large rotation deformation at\nwork. Combining the above two facts, a constitutive model for SMAs developed on\na finite deformation framework is required. A three-dimensional constitutive\nmodel for SMAs considering large strains with large rotations is proposed in\nthis work.

By definition, BP uniquely recovers the\nvector of regression coefficients b if there is no noise and the vector b has\nthe smallest L1 norm among all vectors s such that Xb=Xs (identifiability\ncondition). Furthermore, LASSO can recover the sign of b only under a much\nstronger irrepresentability condition. Meanwhile, it is known that the model\nselection properties of LASSO can be improved by hard-thresholding its\nestimates. This article supports these findings by proving that thresholded\nLASSO, thresholded BPDN and thresholded BP recover the sign of b in both the\nnoisy and noiseless cases if and only if b is identifiable and large enough. In\nparticular, if X has iid Gaussian entries and the number of predictors grows\nlinearly with the sample size, then these thresholded estimators can recover\nthe sign of b when the signal sparsity is asymptotically below the\nDonoho-Tanner transition curve. This is in contrast to the regular LASSO, which\nasymptotically recovers the sign of b only when the signal sparsity tends to 0.\nNumerical experiments show that the identifiability condition, unlike the\nirrepresentability condition, does not seem to be affected by the structure of\nthe correlations in the $X$ matrix.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2018 22:59:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 May 2019 21:10:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 22 Jun 2019 14:33:07 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 31 Aug 2021 16:24:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-01"}

An alternative is to conduct inference\nfor a less constrained posterior and project samples to the constrained space\nthrough a minimal distance mapping.

Pricing provides users\nwith incentives in offloading. However, existing works on pricing are based on\nabstract concave utility functions (e.g, the logarithm function), giving no\ndependence on physical layer parameters. To that end, we first introduce a\nnovel utility function, which measures the cost reduction by offloading as\ncompared with executing jobs locally. Based on this utility function we then\nformulate two offloading games, with one maximizing individual's interest and\nthe other maximizing the overall system's interest. We analyze the structural\nproperty of the games and admit in closed form the Nash Equilibrium and the\nSocial Equilibrium, respectively. The proposed expressions are functions of the\nuser parameters such as the weights of computational time and energy, the\ndistance from the AP, thus constituting an advancement over prior economic\nworks that have considered only abstract functions. Finally, we propose an\noptimal pricing-based scheme, with which we prove that the interactive\ndecision-making process with self-interested users converges to a Nash\nEquilibrium point equal to the Social Equilibrium point.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Dec 2018 00:09:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-17"}

However, when\nsupporting a large number of devices, LoRaWAN suffers from a scalability issue\ndue to the high collision probability of its Aloha-based MAC layer. The\nperformance worsens further when using acknowledged transmissions due to the\nduty cycle restriction at the gateway. For this, we propose FREE, a\nfine-grained scheduling scheme for reliable and energy-efficient data\ncollection in LoRaWAN. FREE takes advantage of applications that do not have\nhard delay requirements on data delivery by supporting synchronized bulk data\ntransmission. This means data is buffered for transmission in scheduled time\nslots instead of transmitted straight away. FREE allocates spreading factors,\ntransmission powers, frequency channels, time slots, and schedules slots in\nframes for LoRaWAN end-devices. As a result, FREE overcomes the scalability\nproblem of LoRaWAN by eliminating collisions and grouping acknowledgments. We\nevaluate the performance of FREE versus different legacy LoRaWAN\nconfigurations.

These computational\nchallenges have been subjects of active research for over four decades. In this\nreview, we present an accessible discussion of the major historical\ndevelopments and state-of-the-art computational techniques relevant to\nsimulation and inference problems for stochastic biochemical reaction network\nmodels. Detailed algorithms for particularly important methods are described\nand complemented with MATLAB implementations. As a result, this review provides\na practical and accessible introduction to computational methods for stochastic\nmodels within the life sciences community.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Dec 2018 02:09:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2019 04:41:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-04"}

Hence, we focus on a\n\\textit{satisficing} strategy that looks for an action whose value is above the\naspiration level (analogous to the break-even point), rather than the optimal\naction. In this paper, we introduce a simple mathematical model called\nrisk-sensitive satisficing ($RS$) that implements a satisficing strategy by\nintegrating risk-averse and risk-prone attitudes under the greedy policy. We\napply the proposed model to the $K$-armed bandit problems, which constitute the\nmost basic class of reinforcement learning tasks, and prove two propositions.\nThe first is that $RS$ is guaranteed to find an action whose value is above the\naspiration level. The second is that the regret (expected loss) of $RS$ is\nupper bounded by a finite value, given that the aspiration level is set to an\n\"optimal level\" so that satisficing implies optimizing. We confirm the results\nthrough numerical simulations and compare the performance of $RS$ with that of\nother representative algorithms for the $K$-armed bandit problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Dec 2018 06:26:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 Feb 2019 11:11:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-26"}

UAD is typically solved by using\ndensity estimation. Recently, deep neural network (DNN)-based density\nestimators, such as Normalizing Flows, have been attracting attention. However,\none of their drawbacks is the difficulty in adapting them to the change in the\nnormal data's distribution. To address this difficulty, we propose AdaFlow, a\nnew DNN-based density estimator that can be easily adapted to the change of the\ndistribution. AdaFlow is a unified model of a Normalizing Flow and Adaptive\nBatch-Normalizations, a module that enables DNNs to adapt to new distributions.\nAdaFlow can be adapted to a new distribution by just conducting forward\npropagation once per sample; hence, it can be used on devices that have limited\ncomputational resources. We have confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed\nmodel through an anomaly detection in a sound task. We also propose a method of\napplying AdaFlow to the unpaired cross-domain translation problem, in which one\nhas to train a cross-domain translation model with only unpaired samples.

In this paper, we propose a fully-automated framework to segment\nleft atrium in gadolinium-enhanced MR volumes. The region of left atrium is\nfirstly automatically localized by a detection module. Our framework then\noriginates with a customized 3D deep neural network to fully explore the\nspatial dependency in the region for segmentation. To alleviate the risk of low\ntraining efficiency and potential overfitting, we enhance our deep network with\nthe transfer learning and deep supervision strategy. Main contribution of our\nnetwork design lies in the composite loss function to combat the boundary\nambiguity and hard examples. We firstly adopt the Overlap loss to encourage\nnetwork reduce the overlap between the foreground and background and thus\nsharpen the predictions on boundary. We then propose a novel Focal Positive\nloss to guide the learning of voxel-specific threshold and emphasize the\nforeground to improve classification sensitivity. Further improvement is\nobtained with an recursive training scheme. With ablation studies, all the\nintroduced modules prove to be effective.

We argue that such\na failure can be used to justify in a simple and heuristic way the existence of\nnon-trivial boson clouds or hair found numerically by Herdeiro and Radu [1,2]\nand analytically by Hod in the test field limit [3-5]. This is due to the\npresence of a contribution that is negative when rotation exists which allows\nfor an integral to vanish even when a non-trivial boson hair is present. The\npresence of such a negative contribution that depends on the rotation\nproperties of the BH is perfectly correlated with the eigenvalue problem\nassociated with the boson-field equation. Conversely, when the rotation is\nabsent the integral turns to be composed only by non negative (i.e. positive\nsemidefinite) terms and thus the only way it can vanish is when the hair is\ncompletely absent. This analysis poses serious challenges and obstructions\ntowards the elaboration of no-hair theorems for more general spacetimes endowed\nwith a BH region even when including matter fields that obey the energy\nconditions. Thus rotating boson stars, if collapsed, may lead indeed to a new\ntype of rotating BH, like the ones found in [1,2]. In order to achieve this\nanalysis we solve numerically the eigenvalue problem for the boson field in the\nKerr-BH background by imposing rigorous regularity conditions at the BH horizon\nfor the non-extremal case ($0<a<M$) which include the near extremal one in the\nlimit $M\\rightarrow a$, as well as the small BH limit $M\\rightarrow\na\\rightarrow 0$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Dec 2018 07:56:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-27"}

The recent deep networks are capable of learning robust\nrepresentations with respect to imaging artifacts and text style changes, but\nstill face various problems while dealing with scene texts with perspective and\ncurvature distortions. This paper presents an end-to-end trainable scene text\nrecognition system (ESIR) that iteratively removes perspective distortion and\ntext line curvature as driven by better scene text recognition performance. An\ninnovative rectification network is developed which employs a novel\nline-fitting transformation to estimate the pose of text lines in scenes. In\naddition, an iterative rectification pipeline is developed where scene text\ndistortions are corrected iteratively towards a fronto-parallel view. The ESIR\nis also robust to parameter initialization and the training needs only scene\ntext images and word-level annotations as required by most scene text\nrecognition systems. Extensive experiments over a number of public datasets\nshow that the proposed ESIR is capable of rectifying scene text distortions\naccurately, achieving superior recognition performance for both normal scene\ntext images and those suffering from perspective and curvature distortions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Dec 2018 08:32:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Mar 2019 12:33:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 2 Apr 2019 09:13:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-03"}

The\nhot Jupiter $\\tau$ Boo Ab orbits the primary star in the long-period ($P\n\\gtrsim 1000\\,$yr), highly eccentric ($e \\sim 0.9$) binary $\\tau$ Bo\\\"otis. Due\nto the long orbital period, the orbit of the stellar binary is poorly\nconstrained. Here we aim to constrain the orbit of the stellar binary $\\tau$\nBoo AB in order to investigate the formation and migration history of the\nsystem. The mutual orbital inclination of the stellar companion and the hot\nJupiter has important implications for planet migration. The binary\neccentricity and periastron distance are important for understanding the\nconditions under which $\\tau$ Boo Ab formed. We combine more than 150 years of\nastrometric data with twenty-five years of high precision radial velocities.\nThe combination of sky-projected and line-of-sight measurements places tight\nconstraints on the orbital inclination, eccentricity, and periastron distance\nof $\\tau$ Boo AB.

Both symmetric and asymmetric systems are investigated.\nSimulations show a significant enhancement of magnetic dissipation within the\nmagnetospheres as both stars get closer. Even though the magnetospheric\nconfiguration depends on the relative orientations of the pulsar spins and\nmagnetic axes, all configurations present nearly the same radiative signature,\nindicating that a common dissipation mechanism is at work. The relative motion\nof both pulsars drives magnetic reconnection at the boundary between the two\nmagnetospheres, leading to efficient particle acceleration and high-energy\nsynchrotron emission. Polar-cap discharge is also strongly enhanced in\nasymmetric configurations, resulting in vigorous pair production and\npotentially additional high-energy radiation. We observe an increase in the\npulsar radiative efficiency by two orders of magnitude over the last orbit\nbefore the merger exceeding the spindown power of an isolated pulsar. The\nexpected signal is too weak to be detected at high energies even in the nearby\nuniverse. However, if a small fraction of this energy is channeled into radio\nwaves, it could be observed as a non-repeating fast radio burst.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Dec 2018 13:01:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

At each level in\nthe plume, the horizontal variation in velocity leads to an along-axis shear\nand hence dispersive transport relative to the mean. With a time-dependent\nsource, axial dispersion of the dynamic properties of the plume has a key role\nin the evolution of the flow. Using ideas of mixing length theory, we introduce\na model for this axial dispersion, and test the model by comparison with\nexperimental observations of plumes in which the buoyancy flux is suddenly\ndecreased or suddenly increased. In both cases, we show the transition from one\nbuoyancy flux to another is self-similar, and using the data, we find the axial\ndispersion may be expressed as \\beta Ub where \\beta\\ lies in the range\n0.70-0.88 and U and b are respectively the horizontally averaged vertical\nvelocity and radius of the plume at height z and time t.

Our study mainly\nfocuses on improving the detection of new word senses. This paper presents a\nunique proposal based on network features to improve the precision of new word\nsense detection. For a candidate word where a new sense (birth) has been\ndetected by comparing the sense clusters induced at two different time points,\nwe further compare the network properties of the subgraphs induced from novel\nsense cluster across these two time points. Using the mean fractional change in\nedge density, structural similarity and average path length as features in an\nSVM classifier, manual evaluation gives precision values of 0.86 and 0.74 for\nthe task of new sense detection, when tested on 2 distinct time-point pairs, in\ncomparison to the precision values in the range of 0.23-0.32, when the proposed\nscheme is not used. The outlined method can therefore be used as a new post-hoc\nstep to improve the precision of novel word sense detection in a robust and\nreliable way where the underlying framework uses a graph structure. Another\nimportant observation is that even though our proposal is a post-hoc step, it\ncan be used in isolation and that itself results in a very decent performance\nachieving a precision of 0.54-0.62.

These properties preclude many\nstatic optimizations and degrade cache performance on traditional systems. To\naddress these challenges, novel systems such as the Emu architecture have been\nproposed. The Emu design uses light-weight migratory threads, narrow memory,\nand near-memory processing capabilities to address weak locality and reduce the\ntotal load on the memory system. Because the Emu architecture is fundamentally\ndifferent than cache based hierarchical memory systems, it is crucial to\nunderstand the cost-benefit tradeoffs of standard sparse algorithm\noptimizations on Emu hardware. In this work, we explore sparse matrix-vector\nmultiplication (SpMV) on the Emu architecture. We investigate the effects of\ndifferent sparse optimizations such as dense vector data layouts, work\ndistributions, and matrix reorderings. Our study finds that initially\ndistributing work evenly across the system is inadequate to maintain load\nbalancing over time due to the migratory nature of Emu threads. In severe\ncases, matrix sparsity patterns produce hot-spots as many migratory threads\nconverge on a single resource. We demonstrate that known matrix reordering\ntechniques can improve SpMV performance on the Emu architecture by as much as\n70% by encouraging more consistent load balancing. This can be compared with a\nperformance gain of no more than 16% on a cache-memory based system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Dec 2018 14:27:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-17"}

Moreover, the feasibility of the optimal measurement of the\ntemperature is discussed in detail. Then, the results are generalized for\nentangled probes and the multi-qubit scenarios for probing the temperature are\nanalysed.

Comparing different schemes for\nmulti-qubit estimation, we find that an increase in the number of the qubits,\ninteracting with the channel, does not necessarily vary the precision of\nestimating the temperature.

The\nsimulations model low Atwood number ($A=0.04$) RTI development for four\ndifferent stratification strengths, corresponding to Mach numbers from 0.3\n(weakly stratified) to 1.2 (strongly stratified), and for three different\nperturbation Reynolds numbers, from 5,000 to 20,000. All simulations use\nadaptive wavelet-based mesh refinement to achieve very fine spatial resolutions\nat relatively low computational cost. For all stratifications, the bubble and\nspike go through the exponential growth regime, followed by a slowing of the\nRTI evolution. For the weakest stratification, this slow-down is then followed\nby a re-acceleration, while for stronger stratifications the suppression of RTI\ngrowth continues. Bubble and spike asymmetries are observed for weak\nstratifications, with bubble and spike growth rates becoming increasingly\nsimilar as the stratification strength increases. For the range of cases\nstudied, there is relatively little effect of Reynolds number on bubble and\nspike heights, although the formation of secondary vortices becomes more\npronounced as Reynolds number increases. The underlying dynamics are analyzed\nin detail through an examination of the vorticity transport equation, revealing\nthat incompressible baroclinicity drives RTI growth for small and moderate\nstratifications, but increasingly leads to the suppression of vorticity\nproduction and RTI growth for stronger stratifications. These variations in\nbaroclinicity are used to explain the suppression of RTI growth for strong\nstratifications, as well as the anomalous asymmetry in bubble and spike growth\nrates for weak stratifications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Dec 2018 15:43:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-17"}

The key advance is\nthe completion of Hamiltonian mechanics to the universal mechanics of particles\nbased on action-waves, consistent with the inclusive validity of the principle\nof stationary action. It is found that irreducible indeterminism is intrinsic\nand universal at all scales of dynamics. The new action-wave equation is the\ncomplete description of single dynamical histories, dissolving the\nclassical-quantum divide. The statistical theory of quantum mechanics emerges\nas the ensemble average of modified action dynamics. The ensemble average of\nthe new action mechanics leads to a hybrid function consisting of the\naction-waves and the probability density of the ensemble. This hybrid\nwavefunction obeys the Schr\\\"odinger equation, which is not a single particle\ndynamical equation. The reconstructed mechanics without matter waves is free of\nthe cardinal problem known as the collapse of the wavefunction and with that,\nthe vexing issue of quantum measurement is resolved.

An ideal, interactive solver would be able to provide physically and\nnumerically accurate results at high frame rate, which requires efficient force\ncomputation and time integration. Towards this goal, we explore in this paper\nfor the first time the use of neural networks to directly learn the underlying\nbiomechanics. Given a 3D mesh of a soft tissue segmented from medical images,\nwe train a neural network to predict vertex-wise accelerations for a large time\nstep based on the current state of the system. The model is trained using the\ndeformation of a bar under torsion, and evaluated on different motions,\ngeometries, and hyperelastic material models. For predictions of ten times the\noriginal time step we observed a mean error of 0.017mm $\\pm$ 0.014 (0.032) at a\nmesh size of 50mm x 50mm x 100mm. Predictions at 20dt yield an error of 2.10mm\n$\\pm$ 1.73 (4.37) and by further increasing the prediction time step the\nmaximum error rises to 38.3mm due to an artificial stiffening. In all\nexperiments our proposed method stayed stable, while the reference solver fails\nto converge. Our experiments suggest that it is possible to directly learn the\nmechanical simulation and open further investigations for the direct\napplication of machine learning to speed-up biophysics solvers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2018 18:57:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-18"}

J. C. Maxwell was the first to introduce the\nalgebra of quaternions to study the physical properties of electromagnetic\nfields. Some scholars follow up this method in the field theories. Nowadays,\nthey employ the complex-octonions to analyze simultaneously the physical\nquantities of electromagnetic and gravitational fields, including the field\npotential, field strength, field source, linear momentum, angular momentum,\ntorque, and force. When the octonion force is equal to zero, it is able to\ndeduce eight independent equilibrium equations, especially the force\nequilibrium equation, precession equilibrium equation, mass continuity\nequation, and current continuity equation. In the force equilibrium equation,\nthe gravitational mass is variable. The gravitational mass is the sum of the\ninertial mass and a few tiny terms. These tiny terms will be varied with not\nonly the fluctuation of field strength and of potential energy, but also the\nspatial dimension of velocity. The study reveals that it is comparatively\nuntoward to attempt to measure directly the variation of these tiny terms of\ngravitational mass in the ultra-strong magnetic field. However it is not such\ndifficult to measure the energy gradient relevant to the variation of these\ntiny terms of gravitational mass. In the complex-octonion space, the\ngravitational mass is a sort of variable physical quantity, rather than an\nintrinsic property of any physical object. And this inference is accordant with\nthe academic thought of `the mass is not an intrinsic property any more' in the\nunified electro-weak theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Dec 2018 12:10:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-20"}

Due to their high actuation energy density\ncompared to other active materials, their current and potential applications in\nengineering fields are expanding rapidly. Prior to being used as actuators,\nSMAs are usually subjected to a training process to stabilize their behavior.\nDuring the training process, permanent changes are introduced in the\nmicrostructure of the material which results in the generation of internal\nstresses and a large amount of irrecoverable Transformation Induced Plastic\nstrain (TRIP). The generated internal stresses along with a potential thermal\nloading provide the driving force to induce the oriented phase transformation\nso that the SMA-based actuators are able to exhibit the Two-Way Shape Memory\nEffect (TWSME) without applying external bias load.

We explored\nvarious recent Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) based techniques and built our\nown hierarchical models to recognize passenger intents along with relevant\nslots associated with the action to be performed in AV scenarios. Our\nexperimental results achieved F1-score of 0.91 on utterance-level intent\nrecognition and 0.96 on slot extraction models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Dec 2018 00:43:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-16"}

This system promised to provide\nsemi-autonomous driving using the existing hardware already installed on Tesla\nvehicles. On March 23rd, 2018, a Tesla vehicle ran into a divider at highway\nspeed, killing the driver. This occurred under the control of the Autopilot\nsystem with no driver intervention. Critics argue that though Tesla gives\ndrivers warnings in its owner's manual, it is ultimately unethical to release a\nsystem that is marketed as an Autopilot yet still makes grave mistakes that any\nhuman driver would not make. Others defend Tesla by stating that their\nadvisories are suitable and that drivers should ultimately be at fault for any\nmistakes of the Autopilot. This paper will scrutinize the ethical implications\nof Tesla's choice to develop, market, and ship a beta product that requires\nextensive testing. It will further analyze the implications of Tesla's\naggressive advertisement of the product under the name Autopilot along with\nassociated marketing materials. By applying the joint ACM/IEEE-CS Software\nEngineering Code of Ethics, this paper will show that Tesla's choices and\nactions during this event are inconsistent with the code and are unethical\nsince they are responsible for adequately testing and honestly marketing their\nproduct.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2018 22:08:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-21"}

Most of these algorithms only account\nfor input such as glucose, insulin and carbohydrate, which limits their\nperformance. Here, we present a novel glucose prediction algorithm which, in\naddition to standard inputs, accounts for meal absorption and physical exercise\ninformation to enhance prediction accuracy. Methods: a compartmental model of\nglucose-insulin dynamics combined with a deconvolution technique for state\nestimation is employed for glucose prediction. In silico data corresponding\nfrom the 10 adult subjects of UVa-Padova simulator, and clinical data from 10\nadults with T1D were used. Finally, a comparison against a validated glucose\nprediction algorithm based on a latent variable with exogenous input (LVX)\nmodel is provided. Results: For a prediction horizon of 60 minutes, accounting\nfor meal absorption and physical exercise improved glucose forecasting\naccuracy. In particular, root mean square error (mg/dL) went from 26.68 to\n23.89, p<0.001 (in silico data); and from 37.02 to 35.96, p<0.001 (clinical\ndata - only meal information). Such improvement in accuracy was translated into\nsignificant improvements on hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia prediction.\nFinally, the performance of the proposed algorithm is statistically superior to\nthat of the LVX algorithm (26.68 vs. 32.80, p<0.001 (in silico data); 37.02 vs.\n49.17, p<0.01 (clinical data). Conclusion: Taking into account meal absorption\nand physical exercise information improves glucose prediction accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2018 18:29:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}
