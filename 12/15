This happens, if the dark matter particle is a\nGoldstone boson whose scattering with ordinary matter is suppressed at low\nenergy due to momentum-dependent interactions. We outline general features of\nthis type of models and analyse a simple realization of these dynamics as a\nconcrete example. In particular, we show that although direct detection of this\ntype of dark matter candidate is very challenging, the indirect detection can\nalready provide relevant constraints. Future projections of the\nindirect-detection experiments allow for even more stringent exclusion limits\nand can rule out models of this type.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Dec 2018 16:00:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-01"}

The data from the ALMA 12 m, 7 m,\nand Total-Power arrays are jointly deconvolved to obtain high-fidelity images\nat high spatial resolution (3 arcsec = 0.7 pc). The four star-forming GMCs show\nvery complex structures with clumps and filaments. The quiescent GMC shows a\nrelatively diffuse, extended emission distribution without prominent clumps or\nfilaments. This difference is similar to that between structured molecular gas\nin Milky Way spiral arms and unstructured gas in the inter-arm regions. We\ncharacterize the difference with the brightness distribution function and\nbrightness distribution index. In conjunction with other ALMA studies of GMCs\nin the LMC, the five GMCs tentatively form an evolutionary trend: from less\nstructured, quiescent GMCs to more structured, actively star-forming GMCs.

While at\nequilibrium, temperature plays the role of a key thermodynamic variable whose\nuniformity in space and time defines the equilibrium state the system is in,\nthis is not the case in a far-from-equilibrium driven system. When energy flows\nthrough a finite system at steady-state, temperature takes on a\ntime-independent but spatially varying character. In this study, the convection\npatterns of a Rayleigh-B{\\'e}nard fluid cell at steady-state is used as a\nprototype system where the temperature profile and fluctuations are measured\nspatio-temporally. The thermal data is obtained by performing high-resolution\nreal-time infrared calorimetry on the convection system as it is first driven\nout-of-equilibrium when the power is applied, achieves steady-state, and then\nas it gradually relaxes back to room temperature equilibrium when the power is\nremoved. Our study provides new experimental data on the non-trivial nature of\nthermal fluctuations when stable complex convective structures emerge. The\nthermal analysis of these convective cells at steady-state further yield local\nequilibrium-like statistics. In conclusion, these results correlate the spatial\nordering of the convective cells with the evolution of the system's temperature\nmanifold.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Dec 2018 16:12:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 May 2019 17:29:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 30 Jun 2019 23:00:52 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 10 Jul 2019 18:43:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-25"}

The junction\nranges from planar insulating oxides to single atoms, molecules, semiconductor\nnanowires, and generally to any finite-size coherent conductor. Recently,\njunctions of more than two superconducting terminals gained broad attention in\nthe context of braiding of Majorana fermions in the solid state for\nfault-tolerant quantum computing, and accessing physics and topology in\ndimensions higher than three. Here we report the first observation of Josephson\neffect in 3- and 4-terminal junctions, fabricated in a top-down fashion from a\nsemiconductor/superconductor (InAs/Al) epitaxial two-dimensional\nheterostructure. Due to interactions, the critical current of an N-terminal\njunction becomes the boundary of an (N-1)-dimensional manifold of\nsimultaneously allowed supercurrents. The measured shapes of such manifolds are\nexplained by the scattering theory of mesoscopic superconductivity, and they\ncan be remarkably sensitive to the junction's symmetry class. Furthermore, we\nobserved a notably high-order (up to 8) multiple Andreev reflections\nsimultaneously across every terminals pair, which verifies the multi-terminal\nnature of normal scattering and a high interface quality in our devices. Given\nthe previously shown gate-control of carrier density and evidence of spin-orbit\nscattering in InAs/Al heterostructures, and device compatibility with other 2D\nmaterials, the multi-terminal Josephson effect reported here can become a\ntestbed for physics and applications of topological superconductivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Dec 2018 16:48:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-09"}

Following the CLIC conceptual\ndesign published in 2012, this report provides an overview of the CLIC project,\nits current status, and future developments. It presents the CLIC physics\npotential and reports on design, technology, and implementation aspects of the\naccelerator and the detector. CLIC is foreseen to be built and operated in\nstages, at centre-of-mass energies of 380 GeV, 1.5 TeV and 3 TeV, respectively.\nCLIC uses a two-beam acceleration scheme, in which 12 GHz accelerating\nstructures are powered via a high-current drive beam. For the first stage, an\nalternative with X-band klystron powering is also considered. CLIC accelerator\noptimisation, technical developments and system tests have resulted in an\nincreased energy efficiency (power around 170 MW) for the 380 GeV stage,\ntogether with a reduced cost estimate at the level of 6 billion CHF. The\ndetector concept has been refined using improved software tools. Significant\nprogress has been made on detector technology developments for the tracking and\ncalorimetry systems. A wide range of CLIC physics studies has been conducted,\nboth through full detector simulations and parametric studies, together\nproviding a broad overview of the CLIC physics potential. Each of the three\nenergy stages adds cornerstones of the full CLIC physics programme, such as\nHiggs width and couplings, top-quark properties, Higgs self-coupling, direct\nsearches, and many precision electroweak measurements. The interpretation of\nthe combined results gives crucial and accurate insight into new physics,\nlargely complementary to LHC and HL-LHC. The construction of the first CLIC\nenergy stage could start by 2026. First beams would be available by 2035,\nmarking the beginning of a broad CLIC physics programme spanning 25-30 years.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Dec 2018 16:51:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2018 12:24:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 6 May 2019 21:54:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-08"}

High resolution radio imaging and\nmulti-wavelength/messenger campaigns are elucidating the conditions under which\nthis happens. Evidence is presented that: AGN jets are formed when the black\nhole spins and the accretion disk is strongly magnetized, perhaps on account of\ngas accretingat high latitude beyond the black hole sphere of influence; AGN\njets are collimated close to the black hole by magnetic stress associated with\na disk wind; higher power jets can emerge from their galactic nuclei in a\nrelativistic, supersonic and proton-dominated state and they terminate in\nstrong, hot spot shocks; lower power jets are degraded to buoyant plumes and\nbubbles; jets may accelerate protons to EeV energies which contribute to the\ncosmic ray spectrum and which may initiate pair cascades that can efficiently\nradiate synchrotron gamma rays; jets were far more common when the universe was\na few billion years old and black holes and massive galaxies were growing\nrapidly; jets can have a major influence on their environments, stimulating and\nlimiting the growth of galaxies.

This approach is based on performing\nlocal averages of the physical fields, which amounts to filtering scales\nsmaller than some parameter $\\ell$. A key step in this work is the derivation\nof a local K\\'arm\\'an-Howarth-Monin relation which provides a local form of\nPolitano and Pouquet's 4/3-law, without any assumption of homogeneity or\nisotropy. Our approach is exact, non-random, and we show its connection to the\nusual statistical results of turbulence. Its implementation on data obtained\nvia a three dimensional direct numerical simulation of the forced,\nincompressible MHD equations from the John Hopkins turbulence database\nconstitutes the main part of our study. First, we show that the local\nK\\'arm\\'an-Howarth-Monin relation holds well.

We find that\nspinodal decomposition is arrested and complex structures form only when\nelectrostatic ion-ion interactions are small. In this case fluid and ion\nconcentrations couple and the charge field can be approximated as a polynomial\nfunction of the relative fluid concentrations alone. When the solvation energy\nassociated with transfering an ion from one fluid phase to the other is of the\norder of a few k_BT, the coupled fluid and charge fields evolve according to\nthe Ohta-Kawasaki free energy functional. This allows us to accurately predict\nstructure sizes and reduce the parameter space to two dimensionless numbers.\nThe lamellar structures induced by the presence of antagonistic salt in our\nsimulations exhibit a high degree of nematic ordering and the growth of ordered\ndomains over time seems to follow a power law.

However, it is impossible for block encryption to achieve the same\nsecurity as one-time pad. Quantum mechanics has changed the modern\ncryptography, and lots of researches have shown that quantum cryptography can\noutperform the limitation of traditional cryptography.\n  This article proposes a new constructive mode for private quantum encryption,\nnamed $\\mathcal{EHE}$, which is a very simple method to construct quantum\nencryption from classical primitive. Based on $\\mathcal{EHE}$ mode, we\nconstruct a quantum block encryption (QBE) scheme from pseudorandom functions.\nIf the pseudorandom functions are standard secure, our scheme is\nindistinguishable encryption under chosen plaintext attack. If the pseudorandom\nfunctions are permutation on the key space, our scheme can achieve perfect\nsecurity. In our scheme, the key can be reused and the randomness cannot, so a\n$2n$-bit key can be used in an exponential number of encryptions, where the\nrandomness will be refreshed in each time of encryption. Thus $2n$-bit key can\nperfectly encrypt $O(n2^n)$ qubits, and the perfect secrecy would not be broken\nif the $2n$-bit key is reused for only exponential times.\n  Comparing with quantum one-time pad (QOTP), our scheme can be the same secure\nas QOTP, and the secret key can be reused (no matter whether the eavesdropping\nexists or not). Thus, the limitation of perfectly secure encryption (Shannon's\ntheory) is broken in the quantum setting. Moreover, our scheme can be viewed as\na positive answer to the open problem in quantum cryptography \"how to\nunconditionally reuse or recycle the whole key of private-key quantum\nencryption\". In order to physically implement the QBE scheme, we only need to\nimplement two kinds of single-qubit gates (Pauli $X$ gate and Hadamard gate),\nso it is within reach of current quantum technology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:50:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-17"}

BDCA\naccelerates the convergence of the classical Difference of Convex functions\nAlgorithm (DCA) thanks to an additional line search step. The purpose of this\npaper is twofold. Firstly, to show that this scheme can be generalized and\nsuccessfully applied to certain types of nonsmooth DC functions, namely, those\nthat can be expressed as the difference of a smooth function and a possibly\nnonsmooth one. Secondly, to show that there is complete freedom in the choice\nof the trial step size for the line search, which is something that can further\nimprove its performance. We prove that any limit point of the BDCA iterative\nsequence is a critical point of the problem under consideration, and that the\ncorresponding objective value is monotonically decreasing and convergent. The\nglobal convergence and convergent rate of the iterations are obtained under the\nKurdyka-Lojasiewicz property. Applications and numerical experiments for two\nproblems in data science are presented, demonstrating that BDCA outperforms\nDCA. Specifically, for the Minimum Sum-of-Squares Clustering problem, BDCA was\non average sixteen times faster than DCA, and for the Multidimensional Scaling\nproblem, BDCA was three times faster than DCA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Dec 2018 18:36:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Jul 2019 12:48:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-24"}

Good\nsynchronization between audio and video modalities is a key factor towards\ndefining the quality of a multimedia presentation. The audio and visual signals\nof a multimedia presentation are commonly managed by independent workflows -\nthey are often separately authored, processed, stored and even delivered to the\nplayback system. This opens up the possibility of temporal misalignment between\nthe two modalities - such a tendency is often more pronounced in the case of\nproduced content (such as movies).\n  To judge whether audio and video signals of a multimedia presentation are\nsynchronized, we as humans often pay close attention to discriminative\nspatio-temporal blocks of the video (e.g. synchronizing the lip movement with\nthe utterance of words, or the sound of a bouncing ball at the moment it hits\nthe ground). At the same time, we ignore large portions of the video in which\nno discriminative sounds exist (e.g. background music playing in a movie).\nInspired by this observation, we study leveraging attention modules for\nautomatically detecting audio-visual synchronization. We propose neural network\nbased attention modules, capable of weighting different portions\n(spatio-temporal blocks) of the video based on their respective discriminative\npower. Our experiments indicate that incorporating attention modules yields\nstate-of-the-art results for the audio-visual synchronization classification\nproblem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Dec 2018 18:37:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-17"}

Percolation rules are defined\nfor two models of disordered quantum spin-chains using their microscopic\nquantum Hamiltonians and the topologies of the associated Fock-space graphs.\nThe percolation transition is revealed by the statistics of Fock-space cluster\nsizes, obtained by exact enumeration for finite-sized systems. As a function of\ndisorder strength, the typical cluster size shows a transition from a volume\nlaw in Fock space to sub-volume law, directly analogous to the behaviour of\neigenstate participation entropies across the MBL transition. Finite-size\nscaling analyses for several diagnostics of cluster size statistics yield\nmutually consistent critical properties. We show further that local observables\naveraged over Fock-space clusters also carry signatures of the transition, with\ntheir behaviour across it in direct analogy to that of corresponding eigenstate\nexpectation values across the MBL transition. The Fock-space clusters can be\nexplored under a mapping to kinetically constrained models.

Optical absorption is modeled\nby a many-body scattering Hamiltonian which describes an exciton immersed in a\nFermi sea. The interaction between electron and exciton is approximated by an\neffective scattering potential, and optical spectra are calculated by solving\nfor the exciton Green's function. From this approach, a trion state can be\nassigned as a bound state of an electron-exciton scattering process, and the\ndoping-dependent phenomena observed in the spectra can be attributed to several\nmany-body effects induced by the interaction with the Fermi sea. While the\nmany-body scattering Hamiltonian can not solved exactly, we reduce the problem\nto two limiting solvable situations. The first approach approximates the full\nmany-body problem by a simple scattering process between the electron and the\nexciton, with a self-energy obtained by solving a Bethe-Salpeter equation\n(BSE). An alternate approach assumes an infinite mass for the exciton, such\nthat the many-body scattering Hamiltonian reduces to a Mahan-Nozieres-De\nDominicis (MND) model. The exciton Green's function can then be solved\nnumerically exactly by a determinantal formulation, and the optical spectra\nshow signatures of the Fermi-edge singularity at high doping densities. The\nfull doping dependence and temperature dependence of the exciton and trion\nlineshapes are simulated via these two approximate approaches, with the results\ncompared to each other and to experimental expectations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Dec 2018 19:00:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

These better measurements place\ntighter constraints on the equation of state of cold matter above nuclear\ndensity. In this article, we discuss a complementary approach to get insights\ninto the structure of neutron stars by providing a model prediction for\nnon-linear fundamental eigenmodes (f-modes) and their decay over time, which\nare thought to be induced by time-dependent tides in neutron star binaries.\nBuilding on pioneering studies that relate the properties of f-modes to the\nstructure of neutron stars, we systematically study this link in the\nnon-perturbative regime using models that utilize numerical relativity. Using a\nsuite of fully relativistic numerical relativity simulations of oscillating TOV\nstars, we establish blueprints for the numerical accuracy needed to accurately\ncompute the frequency and damping times of f-mode oscillations, which we expect\nto be a good guide for the requirements in the binary case. We show that the\nresulting f-mode frequencies match established results from linear perturbation\ntheory, but the damping times within numerical errors depart from linear\npredictions. This work lays the foundation for upcoming studies aimed at a\ncomparison of theoretical models of f-mode signatures in gravitational waves,\nand their uncertainties with actual gravitational wave data, searching for\nneutron star binaries on highly eccentric orbits, and probing neutron star\nstructure at high densities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Dec 2018 19:27:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-24"}

The interpretation relied on a stability analysis\nbased on analytical expressions of the stress intensity factors for a crack\nslightly perturbed both within and out of its original plane, due to Gao and\nRice (1986) and Movchan et al. (1998), coupled with a double propagation\ncriterion combining Griffith's energetic condition and principle of local\nsymmetry. Under such assumptions instability modes were indeed evidenced for\nvalues of the mode mixity ratio of the mode III to mode I stress intensity\nfactors applied remotely larger than some threshold depending only on Poisson's\nratio. Unfortunately, the predicted thresholds were much larger than those\ngenerally observed for typical values of this material parameter. While the\nsubcritical character of the nonlinear bifurcation from coplanar to fragmented\nfronts has been proposed as a possible explanation for this discrepancy (Chen\net al., 2015), we propose here an alternative explanation based on the\nintroduction of a constitutive relationship between the fracture energy and the\nmode mixity ratio, which is motivated by experimental observations. By\nreexamining the linear stability analysis of a planar propagating front, we\nshow that such a relationship suffices, provided that it is strong enough, to\nlower significantly the threshold value of the mode mixity ratio for\ninstability so as to bring it in a range more consistent with experiments.\nInteresting formulae are also derived for the distributions of the perturbed\nstress intensity factors and energy release rate, in the special case of\nperturbations of the crack surface and front obeying the principle of local\nsymmetry and having reached a stationary state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Dec 2018 19:49:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

Addressing these\nissues, we propose a multi-stage tracking framework, Siamese Cascaded RPN\n(C-RPN), which consists of a sequence of RPNs cascaded from deep high-level to\nshallow low-level layers in a Siamese network. Compared to previous solutions,\nC-RPN has several advantages: (1) Each RPN is trained using the outputs of RPN\nin the previous stage. Such process stimulates hard negative sampling,\nresulting in more balanced training samples. Consequently, the RPNs are\nsequentially more discriminative in distinguishing difficult background (i.e.,\nsimilar distractors). (2) Multi-level features are fully leveraged through a\nnovel feature transfer block (FTB) for each RPN, further improving the\ndiscriminability of C-RPN using both high-level semantic and low-level spatial\ninformation. (3) With multiple steps of regressions, C-RPN progressively\nrefines the location and shape of the target in each RPN with adjusted anchor\nboxes in the previous stage, which makes localization more accurate. C-RPN is\ntrained end-to-end with the multi-task loss function. In inference, C-RPN is\ndeployed as it is, without any temporal adaption, for real-time tracking. In\nextensive experiments on OTB-2013, OTB-2015, VOT-2016, VOT-2017, LaSOT and\nTrackingNet, C-RPN consistently achieves state-of-the-art results and runs in\nreal-time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Dec 2018 20:10:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-18"}

Row-access\nmethods provide an ideal framework for solving such problems, since they only\nrequire access to \"blocks\" of the data at any given time. However, when using\nthese iterative sampling methods to solve inverse problems, the main challenges\ninclude a proper choice of the regularization parameter, appropriate sampling\nstrategies, and a convergence analysis. To address these challenges, we first\ndescribe a family of sampled iterative methods that can incorporate data as\nthey become available (e.g., randomly sampled). We consider two sampled\niterative methods, where the iterates can be characterized as solutions to a\nsequence of approximate Tikhonov problems. The first method requires the\nregularization parameter to be fixed a priori and converges asymptotically to\nan unregularized solution for randomly sampled data. This is undesirable for\ninverse problems. Thus, we focus on the second method where the main benefits\nare that the regularization parameter can be updated during the iterative\nprocess and the iterates converge asymptotically to a Tikhonov-regularized\nsolution. We describe adaptive approaches to update the regularization\nparameter that are based on sampled residuals, and we describe a limited-memory\nvariant for larger problems.

A user's utility is a\nconcave function of the achieved throughput or the experienced maximum delay.\nThe problem is important for supporting real-time multimedia traffic, and is\nuniquely challenging due to the need of simultaneously considering maximum\ndelay constraints and throughput requirements. We first show that it is\nNP-complete either (i) to construct a feasible solution strictly meeting all\nconstraints, or (ii) to obtain an optimal solution after we relax maximum delay\nconstraints or throughput requirements up to constant ratios. We then develop a\npolynomial-time approximation algorithm named PASS.

Cooperative game theory is advantageous here because it directly\nconsiders the interaction between features and can be applied to any machine\nlearning method, making it a novel, more accurate way of determining\ninstance-wise biomarker importance from deep learning models. A barrier to\nusing SVE is its computational complexity: $2^N$ given $N$ features. We\nexplicitly reduce the complexity of SVE computation by two approaches based on\nthe underlying graph structure of the input data: 1) only consider the\ncentralized coalition of each feature; 2) a hierarchical pipeline which first\nclusters features into small communities, then applies SVE in each community.\nMonte Carlo approximation can be used for large permutation sets. We first\nvalidate our methods on the MNIST dataset and compare to human perception.\nNext, to insure plausibility of our biomarker results, we train a Random Forest\n(RF) to classify ASD/control subjects from fMRI and compare SVE results to\nstandard RF-based feature importance. Finally, we show initial results on\nranked fMRI biomarkers using SVE on a deep learning classifier for the\nASD/control dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Dec 2018 21:50:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 2019 18:38:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-15"}

We show\nthat this so-called \"multimode strong coupling\" regime can be a powerful tool\nto shape and control decoherence pathways through nontrivial forms of mode\nhybridization. Using frequency- and time-domain measurements, we identify\nhybridized modes with lifetimes that are significantly longer than that of any\nmode of the uncoupled system. This surprising effect, which results from the\ninterference of decay channels, showcases the use of multimode strong coupling\nas a general strategy to mitigate extrinsic loss mechanisms. Moreover, the\nphonons supported by BAW resonators have a collection of properties, including\nhigh frequencies, long coherence times, and robustness against thermal\ndecoherence, making this optomechanical system particularly enticing for\napplications such as quantum transduction and memories. These results show that\nour system can be used to study novel phenomena in a previously unexplored\nregime of optomechanics and could be an important building block for future\nquantum devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Dec 2018 23:22:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2019 21:34:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-05"}

In many practical settings, however, the knowledge\navailable for the researcher is not strong enough so as to specify a unique\ncausal graph.

This task is often challenging because solutions are\nnon-unique due to the complexity of the model and limited observation data.\nHowever, the parameters or states of the model are often known to satisfy\nadditional constraints beyond the model. Thus, we propose an approach to\nimprove parameter estimation in such inverse problems by incorporating\nconstraints in a Bayesian inference framework. Constraints are imposed by\nconstructing a likelihood function based on fitness of the solution to the\nconstraints. The posterior distribution of the parameters conditioned on (1)\nthe observed data and (2) satisfaction of the constraints is obtained, and the\nestimate of the parameters is given by the maximum a posteriori estimation or\nposterior mean. Both equality and inequality constraints can be considered by\nthis framework, and the strictness of the constraints can be controlled by\nconstraint uncertainty denoting a confidence on its correctness. Furthermore,\nwe extend this framework to an approximate Bayesian inference framework in\nterms of the ensemble Kalman filter method, where the constraint is imposed by\nre-weighing the ensemble members based on the likelihood function. A synthetic\nmodel is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and\nin both the exact Bayesian inference and ensemble Kalman filter scenarios,\nnumerical simulations show that imposing constraints using the method presented\nimproves identification of the true parameter solution among multiple local\nminima.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Dec 2018 00:57:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-18"}

Because both\nsimilarities and differences exist among domains, multi-domain models must\ncapture both to achieve good performance.

We study the time\nevolution of the quantum correlations under those protocols in two different\nlimits of the mass quench; fast limit and slow limit depending on the speed\nwith which the mass is changed. We obtain the following two results: (1) For\nthe ECP, we find that the time evolution of logarithmic negativity is, when the\ndistance between the two subsystems is large enough, well-interpreted in terms\nof the propagation of relativistic particles created at a time determined by\nthe limit of the quench we take.

In this work we examine the properties of\nthese large scales in turbulent flows with the use of numerical simulations. We\nshow that the choice of forcing can strongly affect the behavior of the large\nscales. A spectrally-dense forcing (a forcing that acts on {\\it all modes}\ninside a finite-width spherical shell) with long correlation times may lead to\nstrong deviations from the $k^2$ energy spectrum, while a spectrally-sparse\nforcing (a forcing that acts only on a few modes) with short correlated\ntime-scale can reproduce the thermal spectrum. It is shown that the\nspectrally-dense forcing allows for numerous triadic interactions that couple\none large scale mode with two forced modes and this leads to an excess of\nenergy input in the large scales. This excess of energy is then moved back to\nthe small-scales by self-interactions of the large-scale modes and by\ninteractions with the turbulent small-scales. The overall picture that arises\nfrom the present analysis is that the large scales in a turbulent flow resemble\na reservoir that is in (non-local) contact with a second out-of equilibrium\nreservoir consisting of the smaller (forced and turbulent) scales. If the\ninjection of energy at the large scales from the forced modes is relative weak\nthen the large-scale spectrum remains close to a thermal equilibrium and the\nrole of long-range interactions is to set the global energy (temperature) of\nthe equilibrium state. If, on the other hand, the long-range interactions are\ndominant, the large-scale self-interactions cannot respond fast enough to bring\nthe system into equilibrium. Then the large scales deviate from the equilibrium\nstate with energy spectrum that may display exponents different from the $k^2$\nspectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Dec 2018 14:32:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-24"}

We study how the presence of dark matter (DM) in the Sun's core\nchanges the shape of the $^8$B electron-neutrino spectrum.

However,\nthe parallelism of AmbSAT is not compatible with general-purpose\nmicroprocessors in that many clock cycles are required to execute each\niteration; thus, AmbSAT requires special hardware that can exploit the\nparallelism of AmbSAT to quickly find solutions. In this paper, we propose a\ncircuit model (hardware-friendly algorithm) that explores solutions to SAT in a\nsimilar way to AmbSAT, which we call circuit-level AmbSAT (CL-AmbSAT). We\nconducted numerical simulation to evaluate the search performance of CL-AmbSAT\nfor a set of randomly generated SAT instances that was designed to estimate the\nscalability of our approach. Simulation results showed that CL-AmbSAT finds\nsolutions with a fewer iteration number than a powerful SLS solver, ProbSAT,\nand outperforms even AmbSAT. Since CL-AmbSAT uses simple combinational logic to\nupdate variables, CL-AmbSAT can be easily implemented in various hardware.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Dec 2018 07:02:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 24 Feb 2019 04:37:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 6 Nov 2019 02:31:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-07"}

Recently, new\nautomated approaches are becoming more useful. These approaches have been found\nto be effective in some cases. The main weaknesses of these approaches are that\nthey never exploit code dependencies and summarize either the software classes\nor methods but not both. This paper proposes a source code summarization\napproach (Suncode) that produces a short description for each class and method\nin the software system. To validate the approach, it has been applied to\nseveral case studies. Moreover, the generated summaries are compared to\nsummaries that written by human experts and to summaries that written by a\nstate-of-the-art solution. Results of this paper found that Suncode summaries\nprovide better information about code dependencies comparing with other\nstudies. In addition, Suncode summaries can improve and support the current\nsoftware documentation.

CNNs form a large part\nof these AI algorithms. Systolic array based CNN acceleration is being widely\nadvocated due its ability to allow scalable architectures. However, CNNs are\ninherently memory and compute intensive algorithms, and hence pose significant\nchallenges to be implemented on the resource-constrained edge computing\ndevices. Memory-constrained low-cost FPGA based devices form a substantial\nfraction of these edge computing devices. Thus, when porting to such\nedge-computing devices, the designer is left unguided as to how to select a\nsuitable systolic array configuration that could fit in the available hardware\nresources. In this paper we propose Systimator, a design space exploration\nbased methodology that provides a set of design points that can be mapped\nwithin the memory bounds of the target FPGA device. The methodology is based\nupon an analytical model that is formulated to estimate the required resources\nfor systolic arrays, assuming multiple data reuse patterns. The methodology\nfurther provides the performance estimates for each of the candidate design\npoints. We show that Systimator provides an in-depth analysis of\nresource-requirement of systolic array based CNNs. We provide our resource\nestimation results for porting of convolutional layers of TINY YOLO, a CNN\nbased object detector, on a Xilinx ARTIX 7 FPGA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Dec 2018 12:05:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Feb 2019 07:18:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-11"}
