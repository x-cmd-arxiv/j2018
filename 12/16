Previous models usually incorporate contexts holistically.\nHowever, for each pixel, usually only part of its context region is useful and\ncontributes to its prediction, while some other part may serve as noises and\ndistractions. In this paper, we propose a novel pixel-wise contextual attention\nnetwork, \\ie PiCANet, to learn to selectively attend to informative context\nlocations at each pixel. Specifically, PiCANet generates an attention map over\nthe context region of each pixel, where each attention weight corresponds to\nthe relevance of a context location w.r.t the referred pixel. Then, attentive\ncontextual features can be constructed via selectively incorporating the\nfeatures of useful context locations with the learned attention. We propose\nthree specific formulations of the PiCANet via embedding the pixel-wise\ncontextual attention mechanism into the pooling and convolution operations with\nattending to global or local contexts. All the three models are fully\ndifferentiable and can be integrated with CNNs with joint training. We\nintroduce the proposed PiCANets into a U-Net architecture for salient object\ndetection. Experimental results indicate that the proposed PiCANets can\nsignificantly improve the saliency detection performance. The generated global\nand local attention can learn to incorporate global contrast and smoothness,\nrespectively, which help localize salient objects more accurately and highlight\nthem more uniformly. Consequently, our saliency model performs favorably\nagainst other state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we also validate that\nPiCANets can also improve semantic segmentation and object detection\nperformances, which further demonstrates their effectiveness and generalization\nability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Dec 2018 16:20:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-18"}

Whilst mathematically convenient, the restrictive nature\nof the weak coupling assumption can limit the explanatory power of these\nphase-coupled oscillator models. We therefore propose an extension to the\nweakly-coupled oscillator model that incorporates both amplitude and phase as\ndependent variables. We use the bilinear neuronal state equations of dynamic\ncausal modelling as a foundation in deriving coupled differential equations\nthat describe the activity of both weakly and strongly coupled oscillators.

It still remains an open question on\nheterogeneous processor platforms to find the optimal schedule that balances\nthe load within the heterogeneous processor set while minimizing the amount of\ncommunication. A great many studies are based on rectangular partition, whereas\nthe optimality of rectangular partition as the basis has not been well\njustified. In this paper, we propose a new method that schedules matrix\nmultiplication on heterogeneous processor platforms with the mixed co-design\ngoal of minimizing the total communication volume and the multiplication\ncompletion time. We first present the schema of our layer based partition (LBP)\nmethod. Subsequently, we demonstrate that our approach guarantees minimal\ncommunication volume, which is smaller than what rectangular partition can\nreach. We further analyze the problem of minimizing the task completion time,\nwith network topologies taken into account. We solve this problem in both\nsingle-neighbor network case and multi-neighbor network case. In\nsingle-neighbor network cases, we propose an equality based method to solve\nLBP, and simulation shows that the total communication volume is reduced by 75%\nfrom the lower bound of rectangular partition.

During the neutrino observations, the\n$\\gamma$-ray spectrum shows a deviation from a simple power-law shape,\nindicating a spectral cutoff at $E_c =8.50\\pm2.06$ GeV. The spectral energy\ndistributions of PKS 0502+049 are modeled within a one-zone leptonic scenario\nassuming that high energy $\\gamma$-ray emission is produced either by IC\nscattering of synchrotron or dusty torus photons by the electron population\nthat produce the radio-to-optical emission. Alternatively, the observed\n$\\gamma$-rays are modeled considering inelastic interaction of protons, when\nthe jet interacts with a dense gaseous target.

By taking the neutron star or kerr black hole\nas the small body, the deviations of the innermost stable circular orbit\nparameters induced by the particle's spin and cosmological constant are given.\nOur results show that the deviation induced by particle's spin is much larger\nthan that induced by cosmological constant when the test particle locates not\nvery far away from the black hole, the accumulation of phase shift during the\ninspiral from the cosmological constant can be ignored when compared to the one\ninduced by the particle's spin.

This paper gives a first set of\nresults proving that certain deep learning algorithms fail at learning certain\nefficiently learnable functions. The results put forward a notion of\ncross-predictability that characterizes when such failures take place. Parity\nfunctions provide an extreme example with a cross-predictability that decays\nexponentially, while a mere super-polynomial decay of the cross-predictability\nis shown to be sufficient to obtain failures. Examples in community detection\nand arithmetic learning are also discussed.\n  Recall that it is known that the class of neural networks (NNs) with\npolynomial network size can express any function that can be implemented in\npolynomial time, and that their sample complexity scales polynomially with the\nnetwork size. The challenge is with the optimization error (the ERM is\nNP-hard), and the success behind deep learning is to train deep NNs with\ndescent algorithms. The failures shown in this paper apply to training\npoly-size NNs on function distributions of low cross-predictability with a\ndescent algorithm that is either run with limited memory per sample or that is\ninitialized and run with enough randomness. We further claim that such types of\nconstraints are necessary to obtain failures, in that exact SGD with careful\nnon-random initialization can be shown to learn parities. The\ncross-predictability in our results plays a similar role the statistical\ndimension in statistical query (SQ) algorithms, with distinctions explained in\nthe paper.

In this paper, we focus on the use of the powerful representation\nabilities of deep neural features for text effects transfer. For this purpose,\nwe propose a novel Texture Effects Transfer GAN (TET-GAN), which consists of a\nstylization subnetwork and a destylization subnetwork. The key idea is to train\nour network to accomplish both the objective of style transfer and style\nremoval, so that it can learn to disentangle and recombine the content and\nstyle features of text effects images. To support the training of our network,\nwe propose a new text effects dataset with as much as 64 professionally\ndesigned styles on 837 characters. We show that the disentangled feature\nrepresentations enable us to transfer or remove all these styles on arbitrary\nglyphs using one network. Furthermore, the flexible network design empowers\nTET-GAN to efficiently extend to a new text style via one-shot learning where\nonly one example is required.

The reported fatigue threshold (i.e., the minimal\nfracture energy at which crack propagation occurs under cyclic loads) for\nsynthetic hydrogels is on the order of 1-100 J/m2, which is primarily\nassociated with the energy required to fracture a single layer of polymer\nchains per unit area.

The synthetic\ndiffusion equation, which is asymptomatically preserving to the Fourier's heat\nconduction equation in the diffusive regime, contains a term related to the\nFourier's law and a term determined by the second-order moment of the\ndistribution function that reflects the non-Fourier heat transfer.

It aims to encode the entities and\nrelations in the graph into low dimensional vector space, which can be used for\nsubsequent algorithms. Negative sampling, which samples negative triplets from\nnon-observed ones in the training data, is an important step in KG embedding.\nRecently, generative adversarial network (GAN), has been introduced in negative\nsampling. By sampling negative triplets with large scores, these methods avoid\nthe problem of vanishing gradient and thus obtain better performance. However,\nusing GAN makes the original model more complex and hard to train, where\nreinforcement learning must be used.

This phenomenon is poorly\nunderstood for other stars as starspot latitudes are generally unknown. The\nrelated changes in starspot rotation rates caused by latitudinal differential\nrotation can however be measured. Using the set of 3093 Kepler stars with\nactivity cycles identified by Reinhold et al. (2017), we aim to study the\ntemporal change in starspot rotation rates over magnetic activity cycles, and\nhow this relates to the activity level, mean rotation rate, and effective\ntemperature of the star. We measure the photometric variability as a proxy for\nthe magnetic activity and the spot rotation rate in each quarter over the\nduration of the Kepler mission. We phase-fold these measurements with the cycle\nperiod. We perform averages over stars with comparable mean rotation rates and\neffective temperature at fixed activity-cycle phases. We detect a clear\ncorrelation between the variation of activity level and the variation of the\nstarspot rotation rate. The sign and amplitude of this correlation depends on\nthe mean stellar rotation and, to a lesser extent, on the effective\ntemperature. For slowly rotating stars (with periods between 15-28 days) the\nstarspot rotation rates are clearly anti-correlated with the level of activity\nduring the activity cycles. A transition is seen at periods of 10-15 days,\nwhere stars with effective temperature above 4200K instead show positive\ncorrelation. Our results can be interpreted in terms of a stellar \"butterfly\ndiagram\", but these appear different from the Sun's as the starspot rotation\nrates are either in phase or anti-phase with the activity level. Alternatively,\nthe activity cycles seen by Kepler are short (around 2.5 years) and may\ntherefore be secondary cycles, perhaps analogous to the solar quasi-biennial\noscillations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Dec 2018 07:58:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-06"}

Between the two parallel streams, the ANet\ninvestigates appearance features with a multi-scale Siamese atrous CNN,\nenabling the tracking-by-matching strategy. The MNet achieves deep motion\ndetection to localize anonymous moving objects by processing generic motion\nfeatures. The final tracking result at each frame is generated by fusing the\noutput response maps from both sub-networks. The proposed AMNet reports leading\nperformance on both OTB and VOT benchmark datasets with favorable real-time\nprocessing speed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Dec 2018 08:24:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-18"}

While\ninsuring that integrability is maintained in the presence of an external field\nexcludes the elliptic XYZ model which is only integrable at zero field, this\nwork still covers a wide class of fully anisotropic (XYZ) models associated\nwith non skew-symmetric r-matrices.\n  The eigenstates, as constructed here, do not require any usable Bethe ansatz\nand therefore: no proper pseudo-vacuum, Bethe roots, or generalised spin\nraising (Gaudin) operators have to be defined. Indeed, the eigenstates are\ngenerically built only through the conserved charges which define the model of\ninterest and the specification of the set of eigenvalues defining the\nparticular eigenstate. Since these eigenvalues are, in general, solutions to a\nsimple set of quadratic equations, the proposed approach is simpler to\nimplement than any Bethe ansatz and, moreover, it remains completely identical\nindependently of the symmetries of the model.

The two-body 2D\nDirac equation for the massless electron and hole subject to the ribbon\nconfinement, Coulomb interaction and electric field is employed. The ribbon\nconfinement is assumed to be much stronger than the internal exciton electric\nfield which in turn considerably exceeds the external electric field. This\njustifies an adiabatic approximation implying a slow longitudinal and fast\ntransverse electron-hole relative motion governed by the exciton attraction and\naccompanied by the external electric field and ribbon confinement effects,\nrespectively. In the single subband approximation of the isolated\nsize-quantized subbands induced by the ribbon confinement the exciton\nelectroabsorption coefficient is determined in an explicit form. The pronounced\ndependencies of the exciton peak positions, widths and intensities on the\nribbon width and electric field strength are traced. The electron-hole exciton\nattraction modifies remarkably the Franz-Keldysh electroabsorption in the\nfrequency region both below and above the edges determined by the\nsize-quantized energy levels.

They are remarkably powerful in the link\nprediction and knowledge base completion tasks, mainly due to the learned\nrepresentations that capture important statistical dependencies in the data.\nRecent works in the area have focused on either designing new scoring functions\nor incorporating extra information into the learning process to improve the\nrepresentations. Yet the representations are mostly learned from the observed\nlinks between entities, ignoring commonsense or schema knowledge associated\nwith the relations in the graph. A fundamental aspect of the topology of\nrelational data is the cardinality information, which bounds the number of\npredictions given for a relation between a minimum and maximum frequency. In\nthis paper, we propose a new regularisation approach to incorporate relation\ncardinality constraints to any existing neural link predictor without affecting\ntheir efficiency or scalability.

However, the\nadoption of Big Data processing strategies by neuroimaging processing engines\nremains limited. Here, we evaluate three Big Data processing strategies\n(in-memory computing, data locality and lazy evaluation) on typical\nneuroimaging use cases, represented by the BigBrain dataset. We contrast these\nvarious strategies using Apache Spark and Nipype as our representative Big Data\nand neuroimaging processing engines, on Dell EMC's Top-500 cluster. Big Data\nthresholds were modelled by comparing the data-write rate of the application to\nthe filesystem bandwidth and number of concurrent processes. This model\nacknowledges the fact that page caching provided by the Linux kernel is\ncritical to the performance of Big Data applications. Results show that\nin-memory computing alone speeds-up executions by a factor of up to 1.6,\nwhereas when combined with data locality, this factor reaches 5.3. Lazy\nevaluation strategies were found to increase the likelihood of cache hits,\nfurther improving processing time. Such important speed-up values are likely to\nbe observed on typical image processing operations performed on images of size\nlarger than 75GB. A ballpark speculation from our model showed that in-memory\ncomputing alone will not speed-up current functional MRI analyses unless\ncoupled with data locality and processing around 280 subjects concurrently.\nFurthermore, we observe that emulating in-memory computing using in-memory file\nsystems (tmpfs) does not reach the performance of an in-memory engine,\npresumably due to swapping to disk and the lack of data cleanup.

Obtaining downlink (DL) CSI in Frequency\nDivision Duplexing (FDD) systems from uplink (UL) CSI is not as straightforward\nas in TDD systems. Therefore, users usually feed the DL-CSI back to the\ntransmitter. To remove the need for feedback (and thus having less signaling\noverhead), we propose to use two recent deep neural network structures, i.e.,\nconvolutional neural networks and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to\ninfer the DL-CSI by observing the UL-CSI. The core idea of our data-driven\nscheme is exploiting the fact that both DL and UL channels share the same\npropagation environment. As such, we extracted the environment information from\nthe UL channel response to a latent domain and then transferred the derived\nenvironment information from the latent domain to predict the DL channel. To\novercome incorrect latent domain and the problem of oversimplistic assumptions,\nin this work, we did not use any specific parametric model and instead used\ndata-driven approaches to discover the underlying structure of data without any\nprior model assumptions. To overcome the challenge of capturing the UL-DL joint\ndistribution, we used a mean square error-based variant of the GAN structure\nwith improved convergence properties called boundary equilibrium GAN (BEGAN).\nFor training and testing we used simulated data of Extended Vehicular-A (EVA)\nand Extended Typical Urban (ETU) models. Simulation results verified that our\nmethods can accurately infer and predict the downlink CSI from the uplink CSI\nfor different multipath environments in FDD communications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Dec 2018 04:43:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 18 Aug 2019 22:28:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 1 Dec 2019 04:18:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-03"}

On one\nhand, the ability to classify an exhaustive list of categories is excessive for\nthe demands of most IoT applications. On the other hand, designing a new\ncustom-designed CNN for each new IoT application is impractical, due to the\ninherent difficulty in developing competitive models and time-to-market\npressure. To address this problem, we investigate the question of: \"Can one\nutilize an existing optimized CNN model to automatically build a competitive\nCNN for an IoT application whose objects of interest are a fraction of\ncategories that the original CNN was designed to classify, such that the\nresource requirement is proportionally scaled down?\" We use the term resource\nscalability to refer to this concept, and develop a methodology for automated\nsynthesis of resource scalable CNNs from an existing optimized baseline CNN.\nThe synthesized CNN has sufficient learning capacity for handling the given IoT\napplication requirements, and yields competitive accuracy.
