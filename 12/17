Edge networks have been proposed as an\nextension to CDN networks to alleviate this excessive data transfer through\ncaching and to delegate the computation tasks to edge servers. To maximize the\ncaching efficiency in the edge networks, different Mobile Edge Computing (MEC)\nservers assist each others to effectively select which content to store and the\nappropriate computation tasks to process. In this paper, we adopt a\ncollaborative caching and transcoding model for VoD in MEC networks. However,\nunlike other models in the literature, different chunks of the same video are\nnot fetched and cached in the same MEC server. Instead, neighboring servers\nwill collaborate to store and transcode different video chunks and consequently\noptimize the limited resources usage. Since we are dealing with chunks caching\nand processing, we propose to maximize the edge efficiency by studying the\nviewers watching pattern and designing a probabilistic model where chunks\npopularities are evaluated. Based on this model, popularity-aware policies,\nnamely Proactive caching policy (PcP) and Cache replacement Policy (CrP), are\nintroduced to cache only highest probably requested chunks. In addition to PcP\nand CrP, an online algorithm (PCCP) is proposed to schedule the collaborative\ncaching and processing.

Forecast cyclone trajectories are compared\nto the cyclone trajectory in the analysis by means of a dynamic time warping\ntechnique, which allows to find a match in terms of their overall\nspatio-temporal similarity. Each storm is treated as an object and its\nforecasts are analysed using metrics that describe intensity, symmetry,\ncompactness, and upper-level thermal structure. This object-based approach\nallows to focus on specific storm features, while tolerating their shifts in\ntime and space to some extent. The compactness and symmetry of the storms are\ngenerally underpredicted, especially at long lead times. However, forecast\naccuracy tends to strongly improve at short lead times, indicating that the\nECMWF ensemble forecast model can adequately reproduce Medicanes, albeit only\nfew days in advance. In particular, late forecasts which have been initialised\nwhen the cyclone has already developed are distinctly more accurate than\nearlier forecasts in predicting its kinematic and thermal structure, confirming\nprevious findings of high sensitivity of Medicane simulations to initial\nconditions. Findings reveal a markedly non-gradual evolution of ensemble\nforecasts with lead time. Specifically, a rapid increase in the probability of\ncyclone occurrence (\"forecast jump\") is seen in most cases, generally between 5\nand 7 days lead time. Jumps are also found for ensemble median and/or spread\nfor storm thermal structure forecasts. This behaviour is compatible with the\nexistence of predictability barriers. On the other hand, storm position\nforecasts often exhibit a consistent spatial distribution of storm position\nuncertainty and bias between consecutive forecasts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Dec 2018 18:07:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-22"}

To elucidate the role of\nhigher-order structures in community detection problems over complex networks,\nwe introduce the notion of a Superimposed Stochastic Block Model (SupSBM). The\nmodel is based on a random graph framework in which certain higher-order\nstructures or subgraphs are generated through an independent hyperedge\ngeneration process, and are then replaced with graphs that are superimposed\nwith directed or undirected edges generated by an inhomogeneous random graph\nmodel. Consequently, the model introduces controlled dependencies between edges\nwhich allow for capturing more realistic network phenomena, namely strong local\nclustering in a sparse network, short average path length, and community\nstructure. We proceed to rigorously analyze the performance of a number of\nrecently proposed higher-order spectral clustering methods on the SupSBM. In\nparticular, we prove non-asymptotic upper bounds on the misclustering error of\nspectral community detection for a SupSBM setting in which triangles or\n3-uniform hyperedges are superimposed with undirected edges. As part of our\nanalysis, we also derive new bounds on the misclustering error of higher-order\nspectral clustering methods for the standard SBM and the 3-uniform hypergraph\nSBM. Furthermore, for a non-uniform hypergraph SBM model in which one directly\nobserves both edges and 3-uniform hyperedges, we obtain a criterion that\ndescribes when to perform spectral clustering based on edges and when on\nhyperedges, based on a function of hyperedge density and observation quality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Dec 2018 18:20:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-18"}

Current\ncommunication paradigms, including unicast and multicast, require explicit\nidentification of destination nodes (through node IDs or group membership\nprotocols), while directory services translate logical, interest-specific\nqueries into destination IDs where parties are then connected using\ninterest-oblivious protocols. The power and scalability of such paradigms is\nquite limited in the context of future, highly dynamic mobile social networks,\nwhere it is desirable in many scenarios to support implicit membership based on\ninterest.

We propose to exploit the modular\nsymmetries of the moduli effective action to check swampland constraints beyond\nperturbation theory. As an example we study the case of heterotic 4d\n$\\mathcal{N}=1$ compactifications, whose non-perturbative effective action is\nknown to be invariant under modular symmetries acting on the K\\\"ahler and\ncomplex structure moduli, in particular $SL(2,Z)$ T-dualities (or subgroups\nthereof) for 4d heterotic or orbifold compactifications. Remarkably, in models\nwith non-perturbative superpotentials, the corresponding duality invariant\npotentials diverge at points at infinite distance in moduli space. The\ndivergence relates to towers of states becoming light, in agreement with the\ndistance conjecture. We discuss specific examples of this behavior based on\ngaugino condensation in heterotic orbifolds. We show that these examples are\ndual to compactifications of type I' or Horava-Witten theory, in which the\n$SL(2,Z)$ acts on the complex structure of an underlying 2-torus, and the tower\nof light states correspond to D0-branes or M-theory KK modes.

Insights from the perspective\nof nonlinear dynamics reveal essential mathematical features of the buckling\nphenomena. To capture the strong buckling imperfection-sensitivity, initial\ngeometric imperfections in the form of an axisymmetric dimple at each pole are\nintroduced. Dynamic buckling under the step pressure is related to the\nquasi-static buckling pressure. Both loadings produce catastrophic collapse of\nthe shell for conditions in which the pressure is prescribed. Damping plays an\nimportant role in dynamic buckling because of the time-dependent nonlinear\ninteraction among modes, particularly the interaction between the spherically\nsymmetric 'breathing' mode and the buckling mode. In this paper we argue that\nthe precise frequency dependence of the damping does not matter as most of the\ndamping happens at a single frequency (the breathing frequency). In general,\nthere is not a unique step pressure threshold separating responses associated\nwith buckling from those that do not buckle. Instead there exists a cascade of\nbuckling thresholds, dependent on the damping and level of imperfection,\nseparating pressures for which buckling occurs from those for which it does not\noccur.

These AGNs may be good candidates for supermassive binary black holes\n(SMBBHs). The complex line shapes can be very well due to the complex\nkinematics of the two broad line regions (BLRs). Therefore another methods\nshould be applied to confirm the SMBBHs. One of them is spectropolarimetry. We\nrely on numerical modeling of the polarimetry of binary black holes systems\nsince polarimetry is sensitive to geometry, in order to find specific influence\nof supermassive binary black hole (SMBBH) geometry and dynamics on polarized\nparameters across the broad line profiles. We apply our method to SMBBHs in\nwhich both components are assumed to be AGNs with distances at the sub-pc\nscale. We use a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code that simulates the\ngeometry, dynamics and emission of a binary system where two black holes are\ngetting increasingly closer. Each gravitational well is accompanied by its own\nBLR and the whole system is surrounded by an accretion flow from the distant\ntorus. We examine the emission line deformation and predict the polarization\nthat could be observed. We model broad line polarization for various BLR\ngeometries with complex kinematics. We find that the presence of SMBBHs can\nproduce complex polarization angle profiles and strongly affect the polarized\nand unpolarized line profiles. Depending on the phase of the SMBBH, the\nresulting double-peaked emission lines either show red or blue peak dominance,\nor both the peak can have the same intensity. In some cases, the whole line\nprofile appears as a single Gaussian line, hiding the true nature of the\nsource. Our results suggest that observations with the high resolution\nspectropolarimetry of optical broad emission lines could play an important role\nin detecting sub-pc SMBBHs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Dec 2018 20:17:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-06"}

This\nincludes tremendous volumes of bulk multicast traffic generated as a result of\ndata and content replication. Although one can perform these transfers using a\nsingle multicast forwarding tree, that can lead to poor performance as the\nslowest receiver on each tree dictates the completion time for all receivers.\nUsing multiple trees per transfer each connected to a subset of receivers\nalleviates this concern. The choice of multicast trees also determines the\ntotal bandwidth usage. To further improve the performance, bandwidth over\ndedicated inter-datacenter networks can be carved for different multicast trees\nover specific time periods to avoid congestion and minimize the average\nreceiver completion times.\n  In this paper, we break this problem into the three sub-problems of\npartitioning, tree selection, and rate allocation. We present an algorithm\ncalled QuickCast which is computationally fast and allows us to significantly\nspeed up multiple receivers per bulk multicast transfer with control over extra\nbandwidth consumption. We evaluate QuickCast against a variety of synthetic and\nreal traffic patterns as well as real WAN topologies. Compared to performing\nbulk multicast transfers as separate unicast transfers, QuickCast achieves up\nto $3.64\\times$ reduction in mean completion times while at the same time using\n$0.71\\times$ the bandwidth. Also, QuickCast allows the top $50\\%$ of receivers\nto complete between $3\\times$ to $35\\times$ faster on average compared with\nwhen a single forwarding multicast tree is used for data delivery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Dec 2018 23:04:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-18"}

The basic setting is that the objective is\nthe sum of two convex functions: the first function is smooth with up to the\nd-th order derivative information available, and the second function is\npossibly non-smooth, but its proximal tensor mappings can be computed\napproximately in an efficient manner. The problem is to find -- in that setting\n-- the best possible (optimal) iteration complexity for convex optimization.\nAlong that line, for the smooth case (without the second non-smooth part in the\nobjective), Nesterov (1983) proposed an optimal algorithm for the first-order\nmethods (d=1) with iteration complexity O( 1 / k^2 ). A high-order tensor\nalgorithm with iteration complexity of O( 1 / k^{d+1} ) was proposed by Baes\n(2009) and Nesterov (2018). In this paper, we propose a new high-order tensor\nalgorithm for the general composite case, with the iteration complexity of O( 1\n/ k^{(3d+1)/2} ), which matches the lower bound for the d-th order methods as\nestablished in Nesterov (2018), and Shamir et al. (2018), and hence is optimal.\nOur approach is based on the Accelerated Hybrid Proximal Extragradient (A-HPE)\nframework proposed in Monteiro and Svaiter (2013), where a bisection procedure\nis installed for each A-HPE iteration. At each bisection step a proximal tensor\nsubproblem is approximately solved, and the total number of bisection steps per\nA-HPE iteration is bounded by a logarithmic factor in the precision required.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Dec 2018 23:49:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 May 2019 06:00:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 17 Apr 2020 07:05:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-20"}

This concept is implicitly present in the verification of\nqualitative systems, and is more pronounced in the verification of quantitative\nsystems.

This notion is embodied by comparator automata\n(comparators, in short), a new class of automata that read two infinite\nsequences of weights synchronously and relate their aggregate values.\n  We show that aggregate functions that can be represented with B\\\"uchi\nautomaton result in comparators that are finite-state and accept by the B\\\"uchi\ncondition as well.

Previous SNNs training\nmethods can be generally categorized into two basic classes, i.e.,\nbackpropagation-like training methods and plasticity-based learning methods.\nThe former methods are dependent on energy-inefficient real-valued computation\nand non-local transmission, as also required in artificial neural networks\n(ANNs), whereas the latter are either considered to be biologically implausible\nor exhibit poor performance.

By selecting a subset of antennas to transceive messages, AS greatly\nalleviates the requirement on Radio Frequency (RF) chains. This paper studies\nreceive antenna selection in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)\nsystems. The receiver, equipped with a large-scale antenna array whose size is\nmuch larger than that of the transmitter, selects a subset of antennas to\nreceive messages. A low-complexity asymptotic approximated upper capacity bound\nis derived in the limit of massive MIMO systems over independent and identical\ndistributed (i.i.d.) Rayleigh flat fading channel, assuming that the channel\nside information (CSI) is only available at the receiver. Furthermore,\nnumerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the approximation precision\nof the asymptotic results and the tightness of the capacity bound. Besides the\nasymptotic analysis of the upper bound, more discussions on the ergodic\ncapacity of the antenna selection systems are exhibited. By defining the number\nof corresponding rows in the channel matrix as the amount of acquired CSI, the\nrelationship between the achievable channel capacity and the amount of acquired\nCSI is investigated. Our findings indicate that this relationship approximately\nfollows the Pareto principle, i.e., most of the capacity can be achieved by\nacquiring a small portion of full CSI. Finally, on the basis of this observed\nlaw, an adaptive AS algorithm is proposed, which can achieve most of the\ntransmission rate but requires much less CSI and computation complexity\ncompared to state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2018 03:17:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-18"}

A better alternative is\nto propagate the entire useful information to reconstruct the pruned layer\ninstead of directly discarding the less important neurons. To this end, we\npropose a novel Layer Decomposition-Recomposition Framework (LDRF) for neuron\npruning, by which each layer's output information is recovered in an embedding\nspace and then propagated to reconstruct the following pruned layers with\nuseful information preserved.

Specifically, our\nsynthesizer generates mp-MRI data in a sequential manner: first generating ADC\nmaps from 128-d latent vectors, followed by translating them to the T2w images.\nThe synthesizer is trained in a semisupervised manner. In the supervised\ntraining process, a limited amount of paired ADC-T2w images and the\ncorresponding ADC encodings are provided and the synthesizer learns the paired\nrelationship by explicitly minimizing the reconstruction losses between\nsynthetic and real images. To avoid overfitting limited ADC encodings, an\nunlimited amount of random latent vectors and unpaired ADC-T2w Images are\nutilized in the unsupervised training process for learning the marginal image\ndistributions of real images. To improve the robustness of synthesizing, we\ndecompose the difficult task of generating full-size images into several\nsimpler tasks which generate sub-images only. A StitchLayer is then employed to\nfuse sub-images together in an interlaced manner into a full-size image. To\nenforce the synthetic images to indeed contain distinguishable CS PCa lesions,\nwe propose to also maximize an auxiliary distance of Jensen-Shannon divergence\n(JSD) between CS and nonCS images. Experimental results show that our method\ncan effectively synthesize a large variety of mpMRI images which contain\nmeaningful CS PCa lesions, display a good visual quality and have the correct\npaired relationship.

Based on numerical\nexperiments, we argue in favor of a global coextinction conjecture provided the\ndrive fitness is at most $1/2$, irrespective of the brake fitness. The proof\nrelies upon the study of a related predator--prey system with strong Allee\neffect on the prey. Our results indicate that some drives may be unstoppable,\nand that, if gene drives are ever deployed in nature, threshold drives, that\nonly spread if introduced in high enough frequencies, should be preferred.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2018 08:06:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2019 12:22:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-15"}

In\nthis study, an approach for spatially tracking coherent wave events (which\nmeans a cluster of partitions originated from the same meteorological event)\nfrom partitioned numerical wave model outputs is presented to solve this\nproblem. First, an efficient traverse algorithm applicable for different types\nof grids, termed breadth-first search, is employed to track wave events using\nthe continuity of wave parameters.

However, to what extent the computer vision\nmodels for image classification and semantic segmentation are dependent on the\ncontext to make their predictions is unclear. A model overly relying on context\nwill fail when encountering objects in context distributions different from\ntraining data and hence it is important to identify these dependencies before\nwe can deploy the models in the real-world. We propose a method to quantify the\nsensitivity of black-box vision models to visual context by editing images to\nremove selected objects and measuring the response of the target models. We\napply this methodology on two tasks, image classification and semantic\nsegmentation, and discover undesirable dependency between objects and context,\nfor example that \"sidewalk\" segmentation relies heavily on \"cars\" being present\nin the image. We propose an object removal based data augmentation solution to\nmitigate this dependency and increase the robustness of classification and\nsegmentation models to contextual variations.

However, one key drawback for NOMA-based video\nmulticast is the limited number of layers allowed by the embedded successive\ninterference cancellation algorithm, failing to meet satisfaction of\nheterogeneous receivers. We propose a novel receiver-driven superposed video\nmulticast (Supcast) scheme by integrating Softcast, an analog-like transmission\nscheme, into the NOMA-based system to achieve high bandwidth efficiency as well\nas gradual decoding quality proportional to channel conditions at receivers.\nAlthough Softcast allows gradual performance by directly transmitting\npower-scaled transformation coefficients of frames, it suffers performance\ndegradation due to discarding coefficients under insufficient bandwidth and its\npower allocation strategy cannot be directly applied in NOMA due to\ninterference. In Supcast, coefficients are grouped into chunks, which are basic\nunits for power allocation and superposition scheduling.

As gas in a molecular cloud core collapses\nunder self-gravity, the angular momentum of the gas will slow its collapse on\nsmall scales and promote the formation of a protostellar disc. Although the\nangular momenta of dense star-forming cores remain to be fully characterized\nobservationally, existing data indicates that typical cores have enough angular\nmomenta to form relatively large, rotationally supported discs. However,\nmolecular clouds are observed to be permeated by magnetic fields, which can\nstrongly affect the evolution of angular momentum through magnetic braking.\nIndeed, in the ideal MHD limit, magnetic braking has been shown to be so\nefficient as to remove essentially all of the angular momentum of the material\nclose to the forming star such that disc formation is suppressed. This is known\nas the magnetic braking catastrophe. The catastrophe must be averted in order\nfor the all-important rotationally supported discs to appear, but when and how\nthis happens remains debated. We review the resolutions proposed to date, with\nemphasis on misalignment, turbulence and especially non-ideal effects. The\ndissipative non-ideal effects weaken the magnetic field, and the dispersive\nterm redirects it to promote or hinder disc formation. When self-consistently\napplying non-ideal processes, rotationally supported discs of at least tens of\nau form, thus preventing the magnetic braking catastrophe. The non-ideal\nprocesses are sensitive to the magnetic field strength, cosmic ray ionization\nrate, and gas and dust grain properties, thus a complete understanding of the\nhost molecular cloud is required. Therefore, the properties of the host\nmolecular cloud -- and especially its magnetic field -- cannot be ignored when\nnumerically modelling the formation and evolution of protostellar discs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2018 12:26:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-18"}

H2 can be incorporated in\nthe atmosphere of the giant planets. HD has been detected in a few disks and\ncan be considered the most reliable tracer of H2. We wish to form H2 and HD\nefficiently for the varied conditions encountered in protoplanetary disks: the\ndensities vary from 1E4 to 1E16 cm^-3; the dust temperatures range from 5 to\n1500 K, the gas temperatures go from 5 to a few 1000 Kelvin, and the\nultraviolet field can be 1E7 stronger than the standard interstellar field. We\nimplemented a comprehensive model of H2 and HD formation on cold and warm grain\nsurfaces and via hydrogenated PAHs in the physico-chemical code ProDiMo. The H2\nand HD formation can proceed via the Langmuir-Hinshelwood and Eley-Ridel\nmechanisms for physisorbed or chemisorbed H (D) atoms. H2 and HD also form by H\n(D) abstraction from hydrogenated neutral and ionised PAHs and via gas phase\nreactions. H2 and HD are formed efficiently on dust grain surfaces from 10 to\n700 K. All the deuterium is converted into HD in UV shielded regions as soon as\nH2 is formed by gas-phase D abstraction reactions. The detailed model compares\nwell with standard analytical prescriptions for H2 (HD) formation. At low\ntemperatures, H2 is formed from the encounter of two physisorbed atoms.

Assuming a Rician fading channel between AP and RS, and a Rayleigh fading\nchannel on the RS-ST link, we analytically derive results on achievable ranges\nfor the most robust modulation and coding schemes (MCSs). Analyses are\nperformed for two different standard adopted deployment scenarios on the RS-ST\nlink. Moreover, we have analyzed whether the considered most robust MCSs, known\nfor supporting the longest range, but the lowest data rates, can meet the\ndefined requirement of at least 100kb/s for the greatest attainable AP-RS-ST\ndistances.

In numerical applications, this result gives at least an exact lower\nbound on the Hausdorff distance. We also derive an upper bound, and\nconsequently a precise error estimate.

On the other\nhand, we also show that much better accuracy can be expected for\nnon-pathological situations that are more likely to occur in practice.

Surrogate measures of safety have allowed to\nstep away from traditional safety performance functions and analyze safety\nperformance without relying on accident records. In recent years, the use of\nextreme value theory (EV) models in combination with surrogate safety measures\nto estimate accident probabilities has gained popularity within the safety\ncommunity.

Given the outstanding success\ndeep learning has achieved in the field of computer vision and pattern\nrecognition over the past 5 years, in this paper we attempt to investigate the\nuse of deep learning to predict crime rate directly from raw satellite imagery.\nTo this end, we have trained a deep Convolutional Neural Network on satellite\nimages obtained from over one million crime-incident reports collected by the\nChicago Police Department. The best performing model predicted crime rate from\nraw satellite imagery with an accuracy of 79%. To test their reusability, we\nused the learned Chicago models to predict for the cities of Denver and San\nFrancisco city-scale maps indicating crime rate in three different levels.\nCompared to maps made from years' worth of data collected by the corresponding\npolice departments, our maps have an accuracy of 72% and 70%, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2018 13:50:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-18"}

The immersed boundary(IB) method is a widely recognized and\neffective modeling paradigm for simulating fluid-structure interaction(FSI) in\nsuch systems, but a difficulty of the IB formulation is that the pressure and\nviscous stress are generally discontinuous at the interface. The conventional\nIB method regularizes these discontinuities, which typically yields low-order\naccuracy at these interfaces. The immersed interface method(IIM) is an IB-like\napproach to FSI that sharply imposes stress jump conditions, enabling\nhigher-order accuracy, but prior applications of the IIM have been largely\nrestricted to methods that rely on smooth representations of the interface\ngeometry. This paper introduces an IIM that uses only a C0 representation of\nthe interface,such as those provided by standard nodal Lagrangian FE methods.\nVerification examples for models with prescribed motion demonstrate that the\nmethod sharply resolves stress discontinuities along the IB while avoiding the\nneed for analytic information of the interface geometry. We demonstrate that\nonly the lowest-order jump conditions for the pressure and velocity gradient\nare required to realize global 2nd-order accuracy. Specifically,we show\n2nd-order global convergence rate along with nearly 2nd-order local convergence\nin the Eulerian velocity, and between 1st-and 2nd-order global convergence\nrates along with 1st-order local convergence for the Eulerian pressure. We also\nshow 2nd-order local convergence in the interfacial displacement and velocity\nalong with 1st-order local convergence in the fluid traction. As a\ndemonstration of the method's ability to tackle complex geometries,this\napproach is also used to simulate flow in an anatomical model of the inferior\nvena cava.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2018 15:33:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Jun 2019 19:21:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2020 15:46:47 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2022 17:41:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-10"}

Nevertheless, by considering a MEC system\nconsisting of multiple mobile users with stochastic task arrivals and wireless\nchannels in this paper, the design of computation offloading policies is\nchallenging to minimize the long-term average computation cost in terms of\npower consumption and buffering delay. A deep reinforcement learning (DRL)\nbased decentralized dynamic computation offloading strategy is investigated to\nbuild a scalable MEC system with limited feedback.

However, existing studies on this\nissue assume error-free digital transmission, which is not valid for fading\nchannels. With time-varying channel fading, the exact channel state information\nis not available at the transmitter. Thus, random outage and resulting digital\ndistortion cannot be ignored. Moreover, rate allocation should be considered in\nresource allocation, since it not only determines the amount of information for\ndigital transmission and that for analog transmission, but also affects the\noutage probability. Based on above observations, in this paper, we attempt to\nperform joint rate and resource allocation strategies to optimize system\ndistortion in HDA systems over fading channels. Consider a bandwidth expansion\nscenario where a memoryless Gaussian source is transmitted in an HDA system\nwith the entropy-constrained scalar quantizer (ECSQ). Firstly, we formulate the\njoint allocation problem as an expected system distortion minimization problem\nwhere both analog and digital distortion are considered.

The ultimate goal is to shift part of the predictable load on\nthe back-haul links, from on-peak to off-peak periods, contributing to a better\noverall network performance and service experience. To enable the SBs with\nefficient \\textit{fetch-cache} decision-making schemes operating in dynamic\nsettings, this paper introduces simple but flexible generic time-varying\nfetching and caching costs, which are then used to formulate a constrained\nminimization of the aggregate cost across files and time. Since caching\ndecisions per time slot influence the content availability in future slots, the\nnovel formulation for optimal fetch-cache decisions falls into the class of\ndynamic programming. Under this generic formulation, first by considering\nstationary distributions for the costs and file popularities, an efficient\nreinforcement learning-based solver known as value iteration algorithm can be\nused to solve the emerging optimization problem. Later, it is shown that\npractical limitations on cache capacity can be handled using a particular\ninstance of the generic dynamic pricing formulation. Under this setting, to\nprovide a light-weight online solver for the corresponding optimization, the\nwell-known reinforcement learning algorithm, $Q$-learning, is employed to find\noptimal fetch-cache decisions.

A central challenge in manufacturing\nsector lies in the requirement of a general framework to ensure satisfied\ndiagnosis and monitoring performances in different manufacturing applications.\nHere we propose a general data-driven, end-to-end framework for the monitoring\nof manufacturing systems. This framework, derived from deep learning\ntechniques, evaluates fused sensory measurements to detect and even predict\nfaults and wearing conditions. This work exploits the predictive power of deep\nlearning to automatically extract hidden degradation features from noisy,\ntime-course data. We have experimented the proposed framework on ten\nrepresentative datasets drawn from a wide variety of manufacturing\napplications. Results reveal that the framework performs well in examined\nbenchmark applications and can be applied in diverse contexts, indicating its\npotential use as a critical corner stone in smart manufacturing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2018 02:07:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2022 08:53:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-31"}

Combining short\nestimator and long estimator, our scheme acquires the highest accuracy using\nthe smallest memory than other algorithms.

However, the photocatalysis of the pure TiO2 is\nnot effective for the indoor environment due to a lack of the ultraviolet\nirradiation inside the building. Doping TiO2 with substance such as C, N or\nmetal can extend the threshold of the absorption spectrum to the visible\nspectrum region. Thus, doped-TiO2 is able to decompose volatile organic\ncompounds (VOCs) under an indoor environment. To date, most experimental work\nreported on photocatalytic kinetics were conducted inside small-scale devices.\nThe performance of air purification function under the actual indoor\napplication scenery need to be further clarified. For this purpose, it is\ncrucial to predict the performance of autogenous air quality improvements by\nvisible light driven photocatalyst for the actual applications. This work has\ndeveloped a model to evaluate the performance of functional coating with\nphotocatalyst in removing VOCs. Factors such as the effects of coating designs\nand indoor ambient conditions on the air purification efficiency were studied.\nThis work demonstrates that doped-TiO2 photocatalytic coating is effective to\nimprove the indoor air quality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Dec 2018 18:21:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-17"}
