In this context, probabilistic NMF assumes a generative model where\nthe data is usually Bernoulli-distributed. Often, a link function is used to\nmap the factorization to the $[0,1]$ range, ensuring a valid Bernoulli mean\nparameter. However, link functions have the potential disadvantage to lead to\nuninterpretable models. Mean-parameterized NMF, on the contrary, overcomes this\nproblem. We propose a unified framework for Bayesian mean-parameterized\nnonnegative binary matrix factorization models (NBMF).

This article proposes a new\nchange-point detection methodology designed to work well in both infrequent and\nfrequent change-point settings. It is made up of two ingredients: one is \"Wild\nBinary Segmentation 2\" (WBS2), a recursive algorithm for producing what we call\na `complete' solution path to the change-point detection problem, i.e. a\nsequence of estimated nested models containing $0, \\ldots, T-1$ change-points,\nwhere $T$ is the data length. The other ingredient is a new model selection\nprocedure, referred to as \"Steepest Drop to Low Levels\" (SDLL). The SDLL\ncriterion acts on the WBS2 solution path, and, unlike many existing model\nselection procedures for change-point problems, it is not penalty-based, and\nonly uses thresholding as a certain discrete secondary check. The resulting\nWBS2.SDLL procedure, combining both ingredients, is shown to be consistent, and\nto significantly outperform the competition in the frequent change-point\nscenarios tested. WBS2.SDLL is fast, easy to code and does not require the\nchoice of a window or span parameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2018 16:38:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 30 Dec 2018 20:44:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 10 Feb 2020 16:48:40 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 2020 18:37:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-25"}

To infer such associations, it is often of interest to test\nthe structure of the regression coefficients matrix, and the likelihood ratio\ntest (LRT) is one of the most popular approaches in practice. Despite its\npopularity, it is known that the classical $\\chi^2$ approximations for LRTs\noften fail in high-dimensional settings, where the dimensions of responses and\npredictors $(m,p)$ are allowed to grow with the sample size $n$. Though various\ncorrected LRTs and other test statistics have been proposed in the literature,\nthe fundamental question of when the classic LRT starts to fail is less\nstudied, an answer to which would provide insights for practitioners,\nespecially when analyzing data with $m/n$ and $p/n$ small but not negligible.\nMoreover, the power performance of the LRT in high-dimensional data analysis\nremains underexplored.

The job\ncannot start its next stage unless all flows in the coflow finish. To improve\nthe execution performance of such a job, it is crucial to reduce the completion\ntime of a coflow which can contribute more than 50% of the job completion time.\nWhile several schedulers have been proposed, we observe that routing, as a\nfactor greatly impacting the Coflow Completion Time (CCT), has not been well\nconsidered. In this paper, we focus on the coflow scheduling problem and\njointly consider routing and bandwidth allocation. We first provide an\nanalytical solution to the problem of optimal bandwidth allocation with\npre-determined routes. We then formulate the coflow scheduling problem as a\nMixed Integer Non-linear Programming problem and present its relaxed convex\noptimization problem. We further propose two algorithms, CoRBA and its\nsimplified version: CoRBA-fast, that jointly perform routing and bandwidth\nallocation for a given coflow while minimizes the CCT. Through both offline and\nonline simulations, we demonstrate that CoRBA reduces the CCT by 40%-500%\ncompared to the state-of-the-art algorithms. Simulation results also show that\nCoRBA-fast can be tens of times faster than all other algorithms with around\n10% performance degradation compared to CoRBA, which makes the use of\nCoRBA-fast very applicable in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2018 17:08:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-18"}

Ensemble-based methods are among the most successful and efficient\ntechniques currently available for history matching. These methods are usually\nable to achieve reasonable data matches, especially if an iterative formulation\nis employed. However, they sometimes fail to preserve the geological realism of\nthe model, which is particularly evident in reservoir with complex facies\ndistributions. This occurs mainly because of the Gaussian assumptions inherent\nin these methods. This fact has encouraged an intense research activity to\ndevelop parameterizations for facies history matching. Despite the large number\nof publications, the development of robust parameterizations for facies remains\nan open problem.\n  Deep learning techniques have been delivering impressive results in a number\nof different areas and the first applications in data assimilation in\ngeoscience have started to appear in literature. The present paper reports the\ncurrent results of our investigations on the use of deep neural networks\ntowards the construction of a continuous parameterization of facies which can\nbe used for data assimilation with ensemble methods. Specifically, we use a\nconvolutional variational autoencoder and the ensemble smoother with multiple\ndata assimilation. We tested the parameterization in three synthetic\nhistory-matching problems with channelized facies. We focus on this type of\nfacies because they are among the most challenging to preserve after the\nassimilation of data. The parameterization showed promising results\noutperforming previous methods and generating well-defined channelized facies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2018 17:12:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-29"}

We show that this\nsubjective element is not necessary once one takes into consideration the\nfundamental fact that these systems are discrete, i.e. composed of a finite\nnumber $N$ of stars or particles. We show that a connection can be made between\nentropy estimates for discrete systems and the Nyquist-Shannon sampling\ncriterion. Specifically, given a sample with $N$ points in a space of $d$\ndimensions, the Nyquist-Shannon criterion constrains the size of the smallest\nstructures defined by a function in the continuum that can be uniquely\nassociated with the discrete sample. When applied to an $N$-body system, this\ntheorem sets a lower limit to the size of phase-space structures (in the\ncontinuum) that can be resolved in the discrete data. As a consequence, the\nfinite $N$ system tends to a uniform distribution after a relaxation time that\ntypically scales as $N^{1/d}$. This provides an explanation for the fast\nachievement of a stationary state in collapsing $N$-body gravitating systems\nsuch as galaxies and star clusters, without the need to advocate for the\nsubjective effect of coarse-graining.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2018 17:13:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-27"}

Two types of\nmechanisms have been proposed to explain this conundrum. One possibility is\nthat large timescales are generated by a network mechanism based on positive\nfeedback, but this hypothesis requires fine-tuning of the synaptic connections.\nA second possibility is that large timescales in the neural dynamics are\ninherited from large timescales of underlying biophysical processes, two\nprominent candidates being adaptive ionic currents and synaptic transmission.\nHow the timescales of these processes influence the timescale of the network\ndynamics has however not been fully explored. To address this question, we\nanalyze large networks of randomly connected excitatory and inhibitory units\nwith additional degrees of freedom that correspond to adaptation or synaptic\nfiltering. We determine the fixed points of the systems, their stability to\nperturbations and the corresponding dynamical timescales. Furthermore, we apply\ndynamical mean field theory to study the temporal statistics of the activity in\nthe fluctuating regime, and examine how the adaptation and synaptic timescales\ntransfer from individual units to the whole population. Our overarching finding\nis that synaptic filtering and adaptation in single neurons have very different\neffects at the network level. Unexpectedly, the macroscopic network dynamics do\nnot inherit the large timescale present in adaptive currents. In contrast, the\ntimescales of network activity increase proportionally to the time constant of\nthe synaptic filter. Altogether, our study demonstrates that the timescales of\ndifferent biophysical processes have different effects on the network level, so\nthat the slow processes within individual neurons do not necessarily induce\nslow activity in large recurrent neural networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2018 17:42:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Mar 2019 16:09:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-26"}

We analyze how the\ndynamical properties of nodes (such as single neurons) and recurrent\nconnections interact to shape the effective dynamics in large randomly\nconnected networks. A novel dynamical mean-field theory for strongly connected\nnetworks of multi-dimensional rate units shows that the power spectrum of the\nnetwork activity in the chaotic phase emerges from a nonlinear sharpening of\nthe frequency response function of single units. For the case of\ntwo-dimensional rate units with strong adaptation, we find that the network\nexhibits a state of \"resonant chaos\", characterized by robust, narrow-band\nstochastic oscillations. The coherence of stochastic oscillations is maximal at\nthe onset of chaos and their correlation time scales with the adaptation\ntimescale of single units. Surprisingly, the resonance frequency can be\npredicted from the properties of isolated units, even in the presence of\nheterogeneity in the adaptation parameters. In the presence of these\ninternally-generated chaotic fluctuations, the transmission of weak,\nlow-frequency signals is strongly enhanced by adaptation, whereas signal\ntransmission is not influenced by adaptation in the non-chaotic regime.

We consider a source graph and a target graph\nconstructed with samples drawn from data manifolds. We study the problem of\nestimating the unknown class labels on the target graph using the label\ninformation on the source graph and the similarity between the two graphs. We\nparticularly focus on a setting where the target label function is learnt such\nthat its spectrum is similar to that of the source label function. We first\npropose a theoretical analysis of domain adaptation on graphs and present\nperformance bounds that characterize the target classification error in terms\nof the properties of the graphs and the data manifolds. We show that the\nclassification performance improves as the topologies of the graphs get more\nbalanced, i.e., as the numbers of neighbors of different graph nodes become\nmore proportionate, and weak edges with small weights are avoided. Our results\nalso suggest that graph edges between too distant data samples should be\navoided for good generalization performance.

A\nparadigmatic example is the many-body-localization (MBL) transition, which\nmarks the breakdown of quantum thermalization. Characterizing quantum critical\nbehavior in an MBL system requires the measurement of its entanglement\nproperties over space and time, which has proven experimentally challenging due\nto stringent requirements on quantum state preparation and system isolation.\nHere, we observe quantum critical behavior at the MBL transition in a\ndisordered Bose-Hubbard system and characterize its entanglement properties via\nits quantum correlations. We observe strong correlations, whose emergence is\naccompanied by the onset of anomalous diffusive transport throughout the\nsystem, and verify their critical nature by measuring their system-size\ndependence. The correlations extend to high orders in the quantum critical\nregime and appear to form via a sparse network of many-body resonances that\nspans the entire system.

Furthermore, we believe that the methods used in ASE go beyond\nacademic paper and will benefit many other document search tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2018 16:15:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-19"}

This additional\ncontribution significantly worsens the accuracy of the cut-out method for jets\nwith small inclinations with respect to the line of sight. Also, the kinetic SZ\neffect of the bubbles, a previously neglected contribution, becomes relevant at\nthese smaller inclinations due to entrainment and mixing of the intracluster\nmedium with low-density jet material. Fortunately, the different signs of the\nkinetic SZ signal in opposite lobes allow modelling this effect.

We compare our results to\nanalytical waveform models currently implemented in data analysis pipelines.\nFor most simulations, the models lie outside of the predicted numerical errors\nin the last few orbits before merger, but do not show systematic deviations\nfrom the numerical results: comparing different models appears to provide\nreasonable estimates of the modeling errors. The sole exception is the\nequal-mass simulation using a rapidly counter-rotating neutron star to maximize\nthe impact of the excitation of the f-mode, for which all models perform\npoorly. This is however expected, as even the single model that takes f-mode\nexcitation into account ignores the significant impact of the neutron star spin\non the f-mode excitation frequency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2018 19:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

While the effect is expected to be present in single crystals of any\nnoncentrosymmetric metal, we expect it to be strongest in enantiomorphic Weyl\nsemimetals. Using the semiclassical kinetic equation approach we present\nseveral mechanisms underlying the gyrotropic Hall effect.

In general, the intrinsic and extrinsic contributions can be of\nsimilar magnitude.

This implies that polycrystals of strongly\ngyrotropic Weyl semimetals will demonstrate strong current-induced optical\nactivity, whereas the response vanishes for polycrystalline ordinary metals.\nTherefore, the current-induced optical activity can be considered a valuable\ntool in identifying the topological nature of a material.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2018 19:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-09"}

For each image, we first\nextract 2D features for each pixel with a series of 2D convolutions; we then\nbackproject the resulting feature vector to the associated voxel in the 3D\ngrid. This combination of 2D and 3D feature learning allows significantly\nhigher accuracy object detection and instance segmentation than\nstate-of-the-art alternatives. We show results on both synthetic and real-world\npublic benchmarks, achieving an improvement in mAP of over 13 on real-world\ndata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2018 19:04:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Apr 2019 09:44:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 29 Apr 2019 14:18:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-30"}

In our model, parity symmetry is conserved\nat high energy by introducing a mirror sector with the extra gauge symmetry, $\nSU(2)_R \\times U(1)_R$. The charges of $SU(2)_R \\times U(1)_R$ are assigned to\nthe mirror fields in the same way as in the SM, but the chiralities of the\nmirror fermions are opposite to respect the parity symmetry. The strong CP\nproblem is resolved, since the mirror quarks are also charged under the\n$SU(3)_c$ in the SM. In the minimal setup, the mirror gauge symmetry leads to\nstable colored particles which would be inconsistent with the observed data, so\nthat we introduce two scalars in order to deplete the stable colored particles.\nInterestingly, one of the scalars becomes stable because of the gauge symmetry\nand therefore can be a good dark matter candidate. We especially study the\nphenomenology relevant to the dark matter, i.e. thermal relic density, direct\nand indirect searches for the dark matter. The bounds from the LHC experiment\nand the Landau pole are also taken into account. As a result, we find that a\nlimited region is viable: the mirror up quark mass is around [600\\,GeV, 3\\,TeV]\nand the relative mass difference between the dark matter and the mirror up\nquark or electron is about ${\\cal O}$(1-10\\,\\%). We also discuss the neutrino\nsector and show that the right-handed neutrinos in the mirror sector can\nincrease the effective number of neutrinos or dark radiation by $0.14$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2018 19:05:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 May 2019 02:20:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-15"}

Problems with a single, dominant mass can use\nmixed-variable symplectic (MVS) integrators that separate the problem into\nKeplerian motion of satellites about the primary, and satellite-satellite\ninteractions. Here, we examine T+V algorithms where the problem is separated\ninto kinetic T and potential energy V terms. T+V integrators are typically less\nefficient than MVS algorithms. This difference is reduced by using different\nstep sizes for primary-satellite and satellite-satellite interactions. The T+V\nmethod is improved further using 4th and 6th-order algorithms that include\nforce gradients and symplectic correctors. We describe three 6th-order\nalgorithms, containing 2 or 3 force evaluations per step, that are competitive\nwith MVS in some cases. Round-off errors for T+V integrators can be reduced by\nseveral orders of magnitude, at almost no computational cost, using a simple\nmodification that keeps track of accumulated changes in the coordinates and\nmomenta.

Using an\nintegrated approach comprising structural, biochemical, biophysical and\nsingle-molecule fluorescence methods, we show that Cdk2$/$cyclin A-bound p27\nsamples lowly-populated conformations that dynamically anticipate the\nsequential steps of this signaling cascade. \"Dynamic anticipation\" provides\naccess to the non-receptor tyrosine kinases, BCR-ABL and Src, which\nsequentially phosphorylate Y88 and Y74 and promote intra-assembly\nphosphorylation (of p27) on distal T187.

Theoretical proposals\nand emerging experimental evidence suggest that this process leads to the\nformation of intriguing electronic liquid crystal phases. These phases are\ncharacterized by ordered charge and/or spin density modulations, and thought to\nbe intimately tied to the subsequent emergence of superconductivity. The most\nelusive, insulating charge-stripe crystal phase is predicted to occur when a\nsmall density of holes is doped into the charge-transfer insulator state, and\nwould provide a missing link between the undoped parent AFM phase and the\nmysterious, metallic pseudogap. However, due to experimental challenges, it has\nbeen difficult to observe this phase.

In this paper, we advance a definition of a\ncontinuous representation, which can be helpful for training deep neural\nnetworks. We relate this to topological concepts such as homeomorphism and\nembedding. We then investigate what are continuous and discontinuous\nrepresentations for 2D, 3D, and n-dimensional rotations. We demonstrate that\nfor 3D rotations, all representations are discontinuous in the real Euclidean\nspaces of four or fewer dimensions. Thus, widely used representations such as\nquaternions and Euler angles are discontinuous and difficult for neural\nnetworks to learn. We show that the 3D rotations have continuous\nrepresentations in 5D and 6D, which are more suitable for learning. We also\npresent continuous representations for the general case of the n-dimensional\nrotation group SO(n). While our main focus is on rotations, we also show that\nour constructions apply to other groups such as the orthogonal group and\nsimilarity transforms.

Firstly, we study the reconstruction problem and present two\nways in which to solve it within the context of scalar field theory, by\nutilising a duality relation between an effective average action and a\nWilsonian effective action. Along the way we also prove a duality relation\nbetween two effective average actions computed with different UV cutoff\nprofiles. Next we investigate the requirement of background independence within\nthe derivative expansion of conformally reduced gravity. We show that modified\nWard identities are compatible with the flow equations if and only if either\nthe anomalous dimension vanishes or the cutoff profile is chosen to be power\nlaw, and furthermore show that no solutions exist if the Ward identities are\nincompatible. In the compatible case, a clear reason is found why Ward\nidentities can still forbid the existence of fixed points. By expanding in\nvertices, we also demonstrate that the combined equations generically become\neither over-constrained or highly redundant at the six-point level. Finally, we\nconsider the asymptotic behaviour of fixed point solutions in the $f(R)$\napproximation and explain in detail how to construct them.

The Sobol' indices, a commonly used tool in\nGSA, seek to do this by attributing to each variable its relative contribution\nto the variance of the model output. In order to compute Sobol' indices, the\nuser must specify a probability distribution for the uncertain variables. This\ndistribution is typically unknown and must be chosen using limited data and/or\nknowledge. The usefulness of the Sobol' indices depends on their robustness to\nthis distributional uncertainty.

The traditional explanation for how this coordination occurs\nfocuses on the idea of a \"cement pheromone\", a chemical signal left with\ndeposited soil that triggers further deposition. Recent research has called\nthis idea into question, pointing to a more complicated behavioral response to\ncues perceived with multiple senses. In this work, we explored the role of\ntopological cues in affecting early construction activity in Macrotermes. We\ncreated artificial surfaces with a known range of curvatures, coated them with\nnest soil, placed groups of major workers on them, and evaluated soil\ndisplacement as a function of location at the end of one hour. Each point on\nthe surface has a given curvature, inclination, and absolute height; to\ndisambiguate these factors, we conducted experiments with the surface in\ndifferent orientations. Soil displacement activity is consistently correlated\nwith surface curvature, and not with inclination nor height. Early exploration\nactivity is also correlated with curvature, to a lesser degree. Topographical\ncues provide a long-term physical memory of building activity in a manner that\nephemeral pheromone labeling cannot. Elucidating the roles of these and other\ncues for group coordination may help provide organizing principles for swarm\nrobotics and other artificial systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2018 20:51:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-15"}

While\nthe brightness of the condensation was declining precipitously, the total\nbrightness continued to grow in the STEREO-A's HI1 images until two days before\nperihelion. The red magnitudes measured in these images refer to a uniform\ncloud of nuclear fragments, 2200 km^2 in projected area, that began to expand\nat a rate of 76 m s^(-1) at the time of the second outburst.

The slope of\nthe relation strongly depends on the SFR indicator used. In all cases, the\nlocal MS shows a bending at high stellar masses with respect to the slope\nobtained in the low mass regime. While the distribution of galaxies in the\nupper envelope of the MS is consistent with a log-normal distribution, the\nlower envelope shows an excess of galaxies, which increases as a function of\nthe stellar mass but varies as a function of the SFR indicator used. The\nscatter of the best log-normal distribution increases with stellar mass from\n~0.3 dex at 10^{10} M_{\\odot} to ~0.45 at 10^{11} M_{\\odot}. The MS high-mass\nend is dominated by central galaxies of group sized halos with a red bulge and\na disk redder than the lower mass counterparts. We argue that the MS bending in\nthis region is due to two processes: i) the formation of a bulge component as a\nconsequence of the increased merger activity in groups, and ii) the cold gas\nstarvation induced by the hot halo environment, which cuts off the gas inflow\nonto the disk. Similarly, the increase of the MS scatter at high stellar masses\nwould be explained by the larger spread of star formation histories of central\ngroup and cluster galaxies with respect to lower mass systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2018 21:16:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-26"}

Existing methods for quench spot\ndetection include temperature mapping and second-sound triangulation. These\nmethods are useful but all have known limitations. Here we describe a new\nmethod for surface quench spot detection by visualizing the heat transfer in He\nII via tracking He$_2^*$ molecular tracer lines. A proof-of-concept experiment\nhas been conducted, in which a miniature heater mounted on a plate was pulsed\non to simulate a surface quench spot. A He$_2^*$ tracer line created nearby the\nheater deforms due to the counterflow heat transfer in He II. By analyzing the\ntracer-line deformation, we can well reproduce the heater location within a few\nhundred microns, which clearly demonstrates the feasibility of this new\ntechnology. Our analysis also reveals that the heat content transported in He\nII is only a small fraction of the total input heat energy. We show that the\nremaining energy is essentially consumed in the formation of a cavitation zone\nnear the heater. By estimating the size of this cavitation zone, we discuss how\nthe existence of the cavitation zone may explain a decades-long puzzle observed\nin many second-sound triangulation experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2018 22:31:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-10"}

To obtain a global model for prediction, existing\nFL algorithms simply average the client models and ignore the importance of\neach client during model aggregation. Furthermore, there is no optimization for\nlearning a well-generalized global model on the central server. To solve these\nproblems, we propose a novel model aggregation with the attention mechanism\nconsidering the contribution of clients models to the global model, together\nwith an optimization technique during server aggregation. Our proposed\nattentive aggregation method minimizes the weighted distance between the server\nmodel and client models through iterative parameters updating while attends the\ndistance between the server model and client models. Through experiments on two\npopular language modeling datasets and a social media dataset, our proposed\nmethod outperforms its counterparts in terms of perplexity and communication\ncost in most settings of comparison.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2018 23:51:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 2019 05:34:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-22"}

While the dominance of e-e\nscattering already leads to novel behaviors, such as electron hydrodynamic\nflow, further exotic phenomena have been predicted to arise specifically from\nthe unique kinematics of e-e scattering in massless Dirac systems. Here, we use\noptoelectronic probes, which are highly sensitive to the kinematics of electron\nscattering, to uncover a giant intrinsic photocurrent response in pristine\ngraphene. This photocurrent emerges exclusively at the charge neutrality point\nand vanishes abruptly at non-zero charge densities. Moreover, it is observed at\nplaces with broken reflection symmetry, and it is selectively enhanced at free\ngraphene edges with sharp bends. Our findings reveal that the photocurrent\nrelaxation is strongly suppressed by a drastic change of fast photocarrier\nkinematics in graphene when its Fermi level matches the Dirac point.

In the rest frame of the pulsar plasma\nthere are three wave modes in the low-frequency, non-gyrotropic approximation.\nFor parallel propagation these are referred to as the X, A and L modes, with\nthe X and A modes having dispersion relation $z=z_A\\approx1-1/2\\beta_A^2$,\nwhere $z=\\omega/k_\\parallel c$ is the phase speed and $\\beta_Ac$ is the Alfven\nspeed.

In the context of partitioned data stores, it has been\nshown that implicit dependency tracking using timestamps is more efficient than\nexplicit dependency tracking. Existing time-based solutions depend on monotonic\npsychical clocks that are closely synchronized. These requirements make current\nprotocols vulnerable to clock anomalies. In this paper, we propose a new\ntime-based algorithm, CausalSpartanX, that instead of physical clocks, utilizes\nHybrid Logical Clocks (HLCs). We show that using HLCs, without any overhead, we\nmake the system robust on physical clock anomalies. This improvement is more\nsignificant in the context of query amplification, where a single query results\nin multiple GET/PUT operations.

CausalSpartanX also provides causally consistent distributed\nread-only transactions. CausalSpartanX read-only transactions are non-blocking\nand require only one round of communication between the client and the servers.\nAlso, the slowdowns of partitions that are unrelated to a transaction do not\naffect the performance of the transaction.

As these two tasks are related,\nperforming them separately is sub-optimal and might results in inconsistent\npredictions for the same equipment. In order to alleviate these issues, we\npropose two methods: Deep Weibull model (DW-RNN) and multi-task learning\n(MTL-RNN). DW-RNN is able to learn the underlying failure dynamics by fitting\nWeibull distribution parameters using a deep neural network, learned with a\nsurvival likelihood, without training directly on each task. While DW-RNN makes\nan explicit assumption on the data distribution, MTL-RNN exploits the implicit\nrelationship between the long-term RUL and short-term FP tasks to learn the\nunderlying distribution. Additionally, both our methods can leverage the\nnon-failed equipment data for RUL estimation. We demonstrate that our methods\nconsistently outperform baseline RUL methods that can be used for FP while\nproducing consistent results for RUL and FP. We also show that our methods\nperform at par with baselines trained on the objectives optimized for either of\nthe two tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Dec 2018 02:46:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-19"}

In this paper, we propose a novel Recurrent Calibration Network (RCN) for\nirregular scene text recognition. The RCN progressively calibrates the\nirregular text to boost the recognition performance. By decomposing the\ncalibration process into multiple steps, the irregular text can be calibrated\nto normal one step by step. Besides, in order to avoid the accumulation of lost\ninformation caused by inaccurate transformation, we further design a\nfiducial-point refinement structure to keep the integrity of text during the\nrecurrent process. Instead of the calibrated images, the coordinates of\nfiducial points are tracked and refined, which implicitly models the\ntransformation information. Based on the refined fiducial points, we estimate\nthe transformation parameters and sample from the original image at each step.\nIn this way, the original character information is preserved until the final\ntransformation. Such designs lead to optimal calibration results to boost the\nperformance of succeeding recognition.

Since these methods usually minimized\nl1 loss between the output SR image and the ground truth image, they yielded\nvery high peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) that is inversely proportional to\nthese losses. Unfortunately, minimizing these losses inevitably lead to blurred\nedges due to averaging of plausible solutions. Recently, SRGAN was proposed to\navoid this average effect by minimizing perceptual losses instead of l1 loss\nand it yielded perceptually better SR images (or images with sharp edges) at\nthe price of lowering PSNR. In this paper, we propose SREdgeNet, edge enhanced\nsingle image SR network, that was inspired by conventional SR theories so that\naverage effect could be avoided not by changing the loss, but by changing the\nSR network property with the same l1 loss. Our SREdgeNet consists of 3\nsequential deep neural network modules: the first module is any\nstate-of-the-art SR network and we selected a variant of EDSR.

Under the resolvent formulation, the Navier-Stokes equations are\ninterpreted as a forcing-response system: the nonlinear convective term is\ninterpreted as a feedback forcing on the remaining linear terms, which\ngenerates a velocity and pressure response. A gain-based decomposition of the\nlinear forcing-response transfer function --- the resolvent operator --- yields\nhighly amplified velocity and pressure modes, which can be considered key\nbuilding blocks of the turbulent flow field. Previous work has shown that these\nhigh-gain modes provide substantial insight into turbulence statistics,\nstructure, and control of smooth-walled flows. To introduce the effect of\nriblets within this framework, a linear spatially-varying body force is added\nto the governing equations. In other words, volume penalization is used to\napproximate the surface features. Predictions for spanwise-periodic and\nstreamwise-constant riblets show that specific high-gain modes identified from\nthe modified governing equations reproduce observations made in prior direct\nnumerical simulations with limited computation. The deterioration in\nperformance with increasing riblet size is predicted well and so is the\nemergence of spanwise rollers resembling Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices. This new\nmodeling framework is also used to pursue limited riblet shape optimization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Dec 2018 05:34:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-15"}

Recent\ntechniques excel with highly accurate detection rates, provided the 3D input\ndata is obtained from precise but expensive LiDAR technology.

We note that such CaCl\ncrystals are obtained by simply incubating rGO membranes in salt solutions\nbelow the saturated concentration, under ambient conditions. Theoretical\nstudies show that the formation of those abnormal crystals is attributed to the\nstrong cation-pi interactions of the Ca2+ ions with the aromatic rings in the\ngraphitic surfaces. Since strong cation-pi interactions also exist between\nother metal ions (such as Mg2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Cd2+, Cr2+ and Pb2+) and\ngraphitic surfaces, similar 2D crystals with abnormal valence state of the\nmetal cations and corresponding abnormal properties are highly expected.

Of primary importance for the analysis is the detection of themes\nthat are the object of customer problems. Themes are defined in the application\nrequirements and are part of the application ontology that is implicit in the\nccs documentation. Due to variety of customer population, the structure of\nconversations with an agent is unpredictable. A conversation may be about one\nor more themes. Theme mentions can be interleaved with mentions of facts that\nare irrelevant for the application purpose. Furthermore, in certain\nconversations theme mentions are localized in specific conversation segments\nwhile in other conversations mentions cannot be localized. As a consequence,\napproaches to feature extraction with and without mention localization are\nconsidered. Application domain relevant themes identified by an automatic\nprocedure are expressed by specific sentences whose words are hypothesized by\nan automatic speech recognition (asr) system. The asr system is error prone.\nThe word error rates can be very high for many reasons. Among them it is worth\nmentioning unpredictable background noise, speaker accent, and various types of\nspeech disfluencies. As the application task requires the composition of\nproportions of theme mentions, a sequential decision strategy is introduced in\nthis paper for performing a survey of the large amount of conversations made\navailable in a given time period. The strategy has to sample the conversations\nto form a survey containing enough data analyzed with high accuracy so that\nproportions can be estimated with sufficient accuracy. Due to the unpredictable\ntype of theme mentions, it is appropriate to consider methods for theme\nhypothesization based on global as well as local feature extraction. Two\nsystems based on each type of feature extraction will be considered by the\nstrategy. One of the four methods is novel. It is based on a new definition of\ndensity of theme mentions and on the localization of high density zones whose\nboundaries do not need to be precisely detected. The sequential decision\nstrategy starts by grouping theme hypotheses into sets of different expected\naccuracy and coverage levels. For those sets for which accuracy can be improved\nwith a consequent increase of coverage a new system with new features is\nintroduced. Its execution is triggered only when specific preconditions are met\non the hypotheses generated by the basic four systems. Experimental results are\nprovided on a corpus collected in the call center of the Paris transportation\nsystem known as ratp. The results show that surveys with high accuracy and\ncoverage can be composed with the proposed strategy and systems.

State-of-the-art methods for\nhigh-dimensional optimal stopping involve approximating the value function or\nthe continuation value, and then using that approximation within a greedy\npolicy. Although such policies can perform very well, they are generally not\nguaranteed to be interpretable; that is, a decision maker may not be able to\neasily see the link between the current system state and the policy's action.\nIn this paper, we propose a new approach to optimal stopping, wherein the\npolicy is represented as a binary tree, in the spirit of naturally\ninterpretable tree models commonly used in machine learning. We show that the\nclass of tree policies is rich enough to approximate the optimal policy. We\nformulate the problem of learning such policies from observed trajectories of\nthe stochastic system as a sample average approximation (SAA) problem. We prove\nthat the SAA problem converges under mild conditions as the sample size\nincreases, but that computationally even immediate simplifications of the SAA\nproblem are theoretically intractable. We thus propose a tractable heuristic\nfor approximately solving the SAA problem, by greedily constructing the tree\nfrom the top down. We demonstrate the value of our approach by applying it to\nthe canonical problem of option pricing, using both synthetic instances and\ninstances using real S&P-500 data. Our method obtains policies that (1)\noutperform state-of-the-art non-interpretable methods, based on\nsimulation-regression and martingale duality, and (2) possess a remarkably\nsimple and intuitive structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Dec 2018 07:35:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Dec 2019 21:18:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-01"}

We identify three steps that are carried out separately in\ntime, and possibly on different devices: (i) the production of high-fidelity\nsolutions by a commercial software, (ii) the offline stage of the model\nreduction and (iii) the online stage where the reduced order model is\nexploited. The nonintrusivity assumes that only the displacement field solution\nis known, and relies on operations on simulation data during the offline phase\nby using an in-house code. The compatibility with a new commercial code only\nneeds the implementation of a routine converting the mesh and result format\ninto our in-house data format. The nonintrusive capabilities of the framework\nare demonstrated on numerical experiments using commercial versions of the\nfinite element softwares Zset and Ansys Mechanical. The nonlinear constitutive\nequations are evaluated by using the same external plugins as for Zset or Ansys\nMechanical. The large scale simulations are handled using domain decomposition\nand parallel computing with distributed memory. The features and performances\nof the framework are evaluated on two numerical applications involving\nelastoviscoplastic materials: the second one involves a model of high-pressure\nblade, where the framework is used to extrapolate cyclic loadings in 6.5 hours,\nwhereas the reference high-fidelity computation would take 9.5 days.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Dec 2018 08:29:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2019 12:54:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 26 Aug 2019 13:05:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-02"}

Broadly\nspeaking, magnetization control knobs can be classified as energy-driving or\nangular-momentum driving forces. DW propagation driven by a static magnetic\nfield is the best-known example of the former in which the DW speed is\nproportional to the energy dissipation rate, and the current-driven DW motion\nis an example of the latter. Here we show that DW propagation speed driven by a\nthermal gradient can be fully explained as the angular momentum transfer\nbetween thermally generated spin current and DW. We found DW-plane rotation\nspeed increases as DW width decreases. Both DW propagation speed along the wire\nand DW-plane rotation speed around the wire decrease with the Gilbert damping.\nThese facts are consistent with the angular momentum transfer mechanism, but\nare distinct from the energy dissipation mechanism.

In particular, it is seen that a strong boson peak\nanomaly (low-energy excess of modes) in the VDOS can be due almost entirely to\nthe presence of low-energy optical phonons, provided that their energy is\ncomparable to that of the acoustic modes at the Brillouin zone boundary. The\nboson peak is predicted also to occur in the heat capacity at low $T$. In\npresence of strong damping (which might be due to anharmonicities in the\nordered crystals), these optical phonons contribute to the low-$T$ deviation\nfrom Debye's $T^{3}$ law, producing a linear-in-$T$ behavior which is typical\nof glasses, even though no assumptions of disorder whatsoever are made in the\nmodel. These findings are relevant for understanding and tuning thermal\ntransport properties of thermoelectric compounds, and possibly for the\nenhancement of electron-phonon superconductivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Dec 2018 08:59:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Jan 2019 08:19:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 8 Apr 2019 17:22:27 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 9 Apr 2019 09:03:29 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 15 Apr 2019 17:15:55 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sun, 5 May 2019 07:36:06 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2019 16:39:23 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Sat, 21 Mar 2020 09:58:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-24"}

The main issue is that the computational complexity of\nthese problems grows exponentially in the number of variables instead of\npolynomially as for many convex optimization problems. However, often the\nnon-convexity stems only from a subset of variables. Conventional global\noptimization frameworks like monotonic optimization or DC programming treat all\nvariables as global variables and require complicated, problem specific\ndecomposition approaches to exploit the convexity in some variables. To\novercome this challenge, we develop an easy-to-use algorithm that inherently\ndifferentiates between convex and non-convex variables, preserving the low\ncomputational complexity in the number of convex variables. Another issue with\nthese widely used frameworks is that they may suffer from severe numerical\nproblems. We discuss this issue in detail and provide a clear motivating\nexample. The solution to this problem is to replace the traditional approach of\nfinding an {\\epsilon}-approximate solution by the novel concept of\n{\\epsilon}-essential feasibility.

Notably, it has been demonstrated to produce more\nacceptable and correct patches than the patches obtained with mutation\noperators through genetic programming. The performance of pattern-based APR\nsystems, however, depends on the fix ingredients mined from fix changes in\ndevelopment histories. Unfortunately, collecting a reliable set of bug fixes in\nrepositories can be challenging. In this paper, we propose to investigate the\npossibility in an APR scenario of leveraging code changes that address\nviolations by static bug detection tools. To that end, we build the AVATAR APR\nsystem, which exploits fix patterns of static analysis violations as\ningredients for patch generation. Evaluated on the Defects4J benchmark, we show\nthat, assuming a perfect localization of faults, AVATAR can generate correct\npatches to fix 34/39 bugs. We further find that AVATAR yields performance\nmetrics that are comparable to that of the closely-related approaches in the\nliterature. While AVATAR outperforms many of the state-of-the-art pattern-based\nAPR systems, it is mostly complementary to current approaches.

Chemical\nsignatures place IC1396A-PACS-1 among the youngest protostars known. Gaia DR2\ndata reveal velocities in the plane of the sky $\\sim$4km/s for IC1396A with\nrespect to Tr37. The total velocity difference (8 km/s) between the Tr37\ncluster and IC1396A is too small for IC1396A to have undergone substantial\nrocket acceleration, which imposes constraints on the distance to the ionizing\nsource in time and the possibilities of triggered star formation. The three\nstellar populations in the globule reveal that objects located within\nrelatively close distances ($<$0.5pc) can be formed in various episodes within\na $\\sim$1-2 Myr period. We expect substantial differences in initial conditions\nfor the resulting objects and their protoplanetary disks, which may affect\ntheir evolution. Finally, evidence for short-range feedback from the embedded\nprotostars and, in particular, the A-type star V390 Cep is also observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Dec 2018 10:40:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-13"}

Given that some super-Earths are rocky,\nwhile others retain substantial atmospheres, their study can provide clues as\nto the formation of both rocky planets and gaseous planets, and - in particular\n- they can help to constrain the role of photo-evaporation in sculpting the\nexoplanet population. GJ 9827 is a system already known to host 3 super-Earths\nwith orbital periods of 1.2, 3.6 and 6.2 days.

Our analysis can't\nplace a strong constraint on the mass of GJ 9827 c, but does indicate that GJ\n9827 b is rocky with a composition that is probably similar to that of the\nEarth, while GJ 9827 d almost certainly retains a volatile envelope. Therefore,\nGJ 9827 hosts planets on either side of the radius gap that appears to divide\nsuper-Earths into pre-dominantly rocky ones that have radii below $\\sim 1.5\nR_\\oplus$, and ones that still retain a substantial atmosphere and/or volatile\ncomponents, and have radii above $\\sim 2 R_\\oplus$.

We show that Betti\nnumbers entail a considerably richer characterization of the topology of the\nprimordial density field. Of particular interest is that Betti numbers specify\nwhich topological features - islands, cavities or tunnels - define its spatial\nstructure.\n  A principal characteristic of Gaussian fields is that the three Betti numbers\ndominate the topology at different density ranges. At extreme density levels,\nthe topology is dominated by a single class of features. At low levels this is\na \\emph{Swiss-cheeselike} topology, dominated by isolated cavities, at high\nlevels a predominantly \\emph{Meatball-like} topology of isolated objects. At\nmoderate density levels, two Betti number define a more \\emph{Sponge-like}\ntopology. At mean density, the topology even needs three Betti numbers,\nquantifying a field consisting of several disconnected complexes, not of one\nconnected and percolating overdensity.\n  A {\\it second} important aspect of Betti number statistics is that they are\nsensitive to the power spectrum. It reveals a monotonic trend in which at a\nmoderate density range a lower spectral index corresponds to a considerably\nhigher (relative) population of cavities and islands.\n  We also assess the level of complementary information that Betti numbers\nrepresent, in addition to conventional measures such as Minkowski functionals.\nTo this end, we include an extensive description of the Gaussian Kinematic\nFormula (GKF), which represents a major theoretical underpinning for this\ndiscussion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Dec 2018 11:41:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2019 16:57:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-25"}

This model allows to\ndistinguish between the processes generating split and standard transactions.\nWe use the existing theory on score models to establish the invertibility of\nthe score filter and verify that sufficient conditions hold for the consistency\nand asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood of the model parameters. In\nan empirical study, we find that split transactions cause between 92 and 98\npercent of zero and close-to-zero values. Furthermore, the loss of decimal\nplaces in the proposed approach is less severe than the incorrect treatment of\nzero values in continuous models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Dec 2018 12:04:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2020 17:41:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 30 Jan 2022 00:20:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-01"}

However, from collision experiments it follows that it consists of a\n'soup' of countless 'colored' elementary particles such as quarks and gluons\nthat are kept together by the strong nuclear force. The particles constituting\nthe proton are also referred to as partons and their distributions are\ndescribed by parton distribution functions (PDFs). As these functions cannot be\ncalculated, they must be extracted from experiment. More knowledge on PDFs\nteaches us more about the inner workings of protons and enables us to more\naccurately describe collisions between protons at the Large Hadron Collider\n(LHC).\n  In this thesis we have studied quantities that depend on various types of\nPDFs. We have investigated one particular PDF called the Boer-Mulders function\nthat describes correlations between the spin and transverse momentum of quarks\ninside the proton. This function gives rise to a very specific asymmetry in the\ndirections of produced particles. In contrast to earlier expectations, we have\nshown that this PDF does not suffer from quantum effects related to color\nentanglement. Furthermore, we have introduced various new gluon PDFs that\ncontain interesting information on the behavior of gluons.

To enable a massively parallel scaling of these\nsolvers, a novel parallelization technique was recently proposed, which\nconsists in splitting the simulation domain into several processor sub-domains,\nwith guard regions appended at each sub-domain boundaries. Maxwell's equations\nare advanced independently on each sub-domain using local shared-memory FFTs\n(instead of a single distributed global FFT). This implies small truncation\nerrors at sub-domain boundaries, the amplitude of which depends on guard\nregions sizes and order of the Maxwell solver. For a moderate number of guard\ncells (<10) , this 'local' technique proved to be highly scalable on up to a\nmillion cores. Yet, depending on the targeted applications, the number of guard\ncells required to mitigate truncations errors might be very large, which would\nseverely limit the parallel efficiency of this technique due to the large\nvolume of guard cells to be exchanged between sub-domains. In this context, we\npropose a novel 'hybrid' parallelization technique that ensures very good\nscaling of FFT-based solvers with an arbitrarily high number of guard cells. It\nconsists in performing distributed FFTs on local groups of processors with\nguard regions now appended to boundaries of each group of processors. A dual\ndomain decomposition method is used for the Maxwell solver and other parts of\nthe PIC cycle to keep the simulation load-balanced. This 'hybrid' technique was\nimplemented in the open source exascale library PICSAR. Benchmarks show that\nfor a large number of guard cells ($>16$), the 'hybrid' technique offers a\n$\\times 3$ speed-up and $\\times 8$ memory savings compared to the 'local' one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Dec 2018 13:35:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-02"}

Here, quantum dots have\nproven to be well suited systems, as they exhibit both single photon emission\nand single electron charge transport. While single photon emission is generally\nstudied on self-assembled quantum dots, single electron transport studies are\nfocused on gate-defined structures. We investigate, on a single self-assembled\nquantum dot, the single electron transport in the optical telegraph signal with\nhigh bandwidth and observe in the full counting statistics the interplay\nbetween charge and spin dynamics in a noninvasive way. In particular, we are\nable to identify the spin relaxation of the Zeeman-split quantum-dot level in\nthe charge statistics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Dec 2018 14:26:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 2021 14:22:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-10"}

To reduce noise,\nthe travel times were averaged over travel distances from 6$^\\circ$ to\n30$^\\circ$; the mean distance corresponds to a p-mode lower turning point of\n0.91 $R_\\odot$. The 21-year time series of travel-time measurements was split\ninto three seven-year subsets and transformed to obtain power spectra in a\ncorotating frame.\n  Results. The power spectra all show peaks near the frequencies of the\nclassical sectoral Rossby waves for azimuthal wavenumbers in the range $3 \\leq\nm \\leq 15$. The mode frequencies and linewidths of the modes with $m \\leq 9$\nare consistent with a previous study whereas modes with $m \\geq 10$ are shifted\ntoward less negative frequencies by 10--20 nHz. While most of these modes have\ne-folding lifetimes on the order of a few months, the longest lived mode,\n$m=3$, has an e-folding lifetime of more than one year. For each mode, the rms\nvelocity at the equator is in the range of 1--3 m s$^{-1}$ , with the largest\nvalues for $m\\sim10$. No evidence for the $m=2$ sectoral mode is found in the\npower spectrum, implying that the rms velocity of this mode is below $\\sim$0.5\nm s$^{-1}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Dec 2018 14:55:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Jan 2019 20:59:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 2 Mar 2019 16:57:47 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 29 Apr 2019 16:32:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-05"}

Contrary to what might be expected, Tc-poor Miras show\nredder K-[22] colours (i.e. higher dust mass-loss rates) than Tc-rich Miras at\na given period. Here, the previous sample is extended and the analysis is\nexpanded towards other colours and dust spectra. The most important aim is to\ninvestigate if the same two sequences can be revealed in the gas mass-loss\nrate. We analysed new optical spectra and expanded the sample by including more\nstars from the literature. Near- and mid-IR photometry and ISO dust spectra of\nour stars were investigated.

It requires a set of accurate measurements combined with theoretical\nmodels that are used to infer the planetary composition and its depth\ndependence. The masses of Jupiter and Saturn are 317.83 and 95.16 Earth masses,\nrespectively, and since a few decades, we know that they mostly consist of\nhydrogen and helium. It is the mass of heavy elements (all elements heavier\nthan helium) that is not well determined, as well as their distribution within\nthe planets. While the heavy elements are not the dominating materials in\nJupiter and Saturn they are the key for our understanding of their formation\nand evolution histories.\n  The planetary internal structure is inferred from theoretical models that fit\nthe available observational constraints by using theoretical equations of\nstates (EOSs) for hydrogen, helium, their mixtures, and heavier elements\n(typically rocks and/or ices). However, there is no unique solution for the\nplanetary structure and the results depend on the used EOSs and the model\nassumptions imposed by the modeler. Major model assumptions that can affect the\nderived internal structure include the number of layers, the heat transport\nmechanism within the planet (and its entropy), the nature of the core (compact\nvs. diluted), and the location (pressure) of separation between the two\nenvelopes. Alternative structure models assume a less distinct division between\nthe layers and/or a non-homogenous distribution of the heavy elements. Today,\nwith accurate measurements of the gravitational fields of Jupiter and Saturn\nfrom the Juno and Cassini missions, structure models can be further\nconstrained. At the same time, these measurements introduce new challenges for\nplanetary modellers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Dec 2018 15:35:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-19"}

Under the\nassumption of (multivariate) Gaussian likelihoods, we have developed a high\nperformance code that allows highly parallelised prediction of the binned\ntomographic observables and of their joint non-Gaussian covariance matrix\naccounting for terms up to the 6-point correlation function and super-sample\neffects. This performance allows us to qualitatively address several\ninteresting scientific questions. We find that the bispectrum provides an\nimprovement in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of about 10% on top of the\npower spectrum, making it a non-negligible source of information for future\nsurveys. Furthermore, we are capable to test the impact of theoretical\nuncertainties in the halo model used to build our observables; with presently\nallowed variations we conclude that the impact is negligible on the S/N.\nFinally, we consider data compression possibilities to optimise future analyses\nof the weak lensing bispectrum.

We develop\na question-answering (QA) method that uses active human-computer communications\nto mine patterns from a pre-trained CNN, in order to incrementally explain more\nfeatures in conv-layers. During the learning process, our QA method uses the\ncurrent AOG for part localization. The QA method actively identifies objects,\nwhose feature maps cannot be explained by the AOG. Then, our method asks people\nto annotate parts on the unexplained objects, and uses answers to discover CNN\npatterns corresponding to the newly labeled parts.

Machine learning-based methods have\nrecently emerged as a disruptive way to obtain near-optimal performance for\nMINLPs with affordable computational complexity. There have been some attempts\nin applying such methods to resource management in wireless networks, but these\nattempts require huge amounts of training samples and lack the capability to\nhandle constrained problems. Furthermore, they suffer from severe performance\ndeterioration when the network parameters change, which commonly happens and is\nreferred to as the task mismatch problem. In this paper, to reduce the sample\ncomplexity and address the feasibility issue, we propose a framework of\nLearning to Optimize for Resource Management (LORM). Instead of the end-to-end\nlearning approach adopted in previous studies, LORM learns the optimal pruning\npolicy in the branch-and-bound algorithm for MINLPs via a sample-efficient\nmethod, namely, imitation learning. To further address the task mismatch\nproblem, we develop a transfer learning method via self-imitation in LORM,\nnamed LORM-TL, which can quickly adapt a pre-trained machine learning model to\nthe new task with only a few additional unlabeled training samples. Numerical\nsimulations will demonstrate that LORM outperforms specialized state-of-the-art\nalgorithms and achieves near-optimal performance, while achieving significant\nspeedup compared with the branch-and-bound algorithm.

In electromagnetics, zero-permittivity metamaterials have been\nused to enhance the coupling of energy in and out of ultranarrow channels,\nbased on a phenomenon known as supercoupling. These metamaterial channels can\nsupport total transmission and complete phase uniformity, independent of the\nchannel length, despite being geometrically mismatched to their input and\noutput ports. In the field of acoustics, this phenomenon is challenging to\nachieve, since it requires zero-density metamaterials, typically realized with\nwaveguides periodically loaded with membranes or resonators. Compared to\nelectromagnetics, the additional challenge is due to the fact that conventional\nacoustic waveguides do not support a cut-off for the dominant mode of\npropagation, and therefore zero-index can be achieved only based on a\ncollective resonance of the loading elements. Here we propose and\nexperimentally realize acoustic supercoupling in a dual regime, using a\ncompressibility-near-zero acoustic channel. Rather than engineering the channel\nwith subwavelength inclusions, we operate at the cut-off of a higher-order\nacoustic mode, demonstrating the realization and efficient excitation of a\nzero-compressibility waveguide with effective soft boundaries. We\nexperimentally verify strong transmission through a largely mismatched channel\nand uniform phase distribution, independent of the channel length.
