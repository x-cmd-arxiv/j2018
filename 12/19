This is a scheme, first proposed by\none author (Carlson) at a meeting at the SKAO 25-Jan-2013, to digitize the\nanalog signal at each antenna at a slightly different sample rate and transmit\nthe data to the CSP Mid.CBF for subsequent digital re-sampling to a common\nsample clock frequency before channelization, correlation, and beamforming. The\nprimary purpose for doing this is to cause de-correlation of sample\nclock-related self-interference to be able to improve correlated and beamformed\nsignal quality. This report includes an investigation of the efficacy of the\nmethod, investigation of its implementation by SADT, DISH, and CSP,\npresentation of further supporting modeling results augmenting the original\nmodeling work, a note on expansion to SKA-2, as well as possible draw-backs and\nconcerns.

This is borne out by the fact that a reinforcement learning\nagent has no prior knowledge of the world, no pre-existing data to depend on\nand so must devote considerable time to exploration. Transfer learning can\nalleviate some of the problems by leveraging learning done on some source task\nto help learning on some target task. Our work presents an algorithm for\ninitialising the hidden feature representation of the target task. We propose a\ndomain adaptation method to transfer state representations and demonstrate\ntransfer across domains, tasks and action spaces. We utilise adversarial domain\nadaptation ideas combined with an adversarial autoencoder architecture. We\nalign our new policies' representation space with a pre-trained source policy,\ntaking target task data generated from a random policy. We demonstrate that\nthis initialisation step provides significant improvement when learning a new\nreinforcement learning task, which highlights the wide applicability of\nadversarial adaptation methods; even as the task and label/action space also\nchanges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Dec 2018 16:08:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-19"}

Unlike centralized learning that needs to collect data\nfrom users and store them collectively on a cloud server, federated learning\nmakes it possible to learn a global model while the data are distributed on the\nusers' devices. However, compared with the traditional centralized approach,\nthe federated setting consumes considerable communication resources of the\nclients, which is indispensable for updating global models and prevents this\ntechnique from being widely used. In this paper, we aim to optimize the\nstructure of the neural network models in federated learning using a\nmulti-objective evolutionary algorithm to simultaneously minimize the\ncommunication costs and the global model test errors. A scalable method for\nencoding network connectivity is adapted to federated learning to enhance the\nefficiency in evolving deep neural networks.

The three hottest known DAs (surface gravity log g $\\geq$\n7.0) have effective temperatures around Teff = 140,000 K, followed by only five\nobjects in the range 104,000 - 120,000 K. They are by far outnumbered by forty\nnon-DAs with Teff = 100,000 - 250,000 K, giving a DA/non-DA ratio of 0.2. In\ncontrast, this ratio is the inverse of that for the cooler WDs. One reason for\nthis discrepancy could be uncertainties in the temperature determination of hot\nDAs using Balmer-line spectroscopy. Recent investigations involving\nmetal-ionization balances in ultraviolet (UV) spectra indeed showed that the\ntemperatures of some DAs were underestimated, but the paucity of extremely hot\nDAs prevailed. Here we present the results of a UV spectral analysis of one of\nthe three hottest DAs, PG0948+534. We find that its temperature was strongly\noverestimated by recent Balmer line analyses. We correct it downward to 105,000\n$\\pm$ 5000 K, aggravating the hot-DA paucity. The Balmer-line problem\nencountered previously is not resolved by our non-LTE line-blanketed model\natmospheres. We speculate that it might be related to the possible presence of\na magnetosphere. This is supported by the V-band variability that shows a\nperiod of P=3.45 d (amplitude 0.19 mag), which we interpret as the star's\nrotation period. The metal abundances in PG0948+534 are affected by atomic\ndiffusion and we conclude that the onset of diffusion in hot DAs occurs when\nthey cool below Teff about 105,000 K. We discuss the possibility that the\npaucity of very hot DAs is a consequence of their fast evolutionary rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Dec 2018 17:12:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-26"}

It is, therefore, rational that such\na data packet be transmitted only if it is valuable in the sense of a\ncost-benefit analysis. Yet, the fact is that little is known so far about this\nvaluation of information and its connection with traditional event-triggered\ncommunication. In the present article, we study this intrinsic property of\nnetworked control systems by formulating a rate-regulation tradeoff between the\npacket rate and the regulation cost with an event trigger and a controller as\ntwo distributed decision makers, and show that the valuation of information is\nconceivable and quantifiable grounded on this tradeoff. In particular, we\ncharacterize an equilibrium in the rate-regulation tradeoff, and quantify the\nvalue of information $\\text{VoI}_k$ there as the variation in a so-called value\nfunction with respect to a piece of sensory information that can be\ncommunicated to the controller at each time $k$.

In many respects, blue\nhorizontal-branch stars closely resemble the magnetic chemically peculiar stars\nof the upper main sequence, which show photometric variability caused by\nabundance spots on their surfaces. These spots are thought to be caused by\ndiffusion and the presence of a stable magnetic field. However, the latter does\nnot seem to be axiomatic. We searched for rotationally induced variability in\n30 well-established bright field blue horizontal-branch stars in the solar\nneighbourhood and searched the literature for magnetic fields measurements of\nour targets. We employed archival photometric time series data from the ASAS,\nASAS-SN, and SuperWASP surveys.

From K2 observations of the globular cluster\nM4, we find that out of 24 horizontal branch stars not previously known to be\nRR Lyrae variables, two show photometric variability with periods and shapes\nconsistent with those of first overtone RR Lyrae variables. The variability of\nthese two stars, however, have amplitudes of only one part in a thousand, which\nis ${\\sim}$200 times smaller than for any RR Lyrae variable in the cluster, and\nmuch smaller than any known RR Lyrae variable generally. The periods and\namplitudes are: 0.33190704 d with 1.0 mmag amplitude and 0.31673414 d with 0.3\nmmag amplitude. The stars lie just outside the instability strip, one blueward\nand one redward. The star redward of the instability strip also exhibits\nsignificant multi-periodic variability at lower frequencies. We examine\npotential blend scenarios and argue that they are all either physically\nimplausible or highly improbable. Stars such as these are likely to shed\nvaluable light on many aspects of stellar physics, including the mechanism(s)\nthat set amplitudes of RR Lyrae variables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Dec 2018 18:32:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-09"}

Such sets and measures turn out not to be arbitrary, and often\ntimes come with special structure inherited from what they are being\napproximated by.\n  We will begin by recalling and proving the standard Reifenberg theorem, which\nsays that sets in Euclidean space which are well approximated by affine\nsubspaces on all scales must be homoemorphic to balls.

Here we present a large\nsample of new simulations of the \"Early Instability\" scenario. We use an N-body\nintegration scheme that accounts for collisional fragmentation, and also\nperform a large set of control simulations that do not include an early giant\nplanet instability. Since the total particle number decreases slower when\ncollisional fragmentation is accounted for, the growing planets' orbits are\ndamped more strongly via dynamical friction and encounters with small bodies\nthat dissipate angular momentum (eg: hit-and-run impacts). Compared with\nsimulations without collisional fragmentation, our fully evolved systems\nprovide better matches to the solar system's terrestrial planets in terms of\ntheir compact mass distribution and dynamically cold orbits. Collisional\nprocesses also tend to lengthen the dynamical accretion timescales of Earth\nanalogs, and shorten those of Mars analogs. This yields systems with relative\ngrowth timescales more consistent with those inferred from isotopic dating.\nAccounting for fragmentation is thus supremely important for any successful\nevolutionary model of the inner solar system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Dec 2018 19:00:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-09"}

In a class of large $N$ models, one would\nnaively expect an incoherent (non-Fermi liquid) normal state behavior to\npersist down to $T=0$. However, this is not the case for quantum-critical\nsystems described by Eliashberg theory, where non-Fermi liquid part of the\nself-energy $\\Sigma (\\omega_m)$ is large for a generic Matsubara frequency\n$\\omega_m = \\pi T(2m+1)$, but vanishes at $\\omega_m = \\pm \\pi T$, while the\npairing interaction between fermions with these two frequencies remains strong.\nThis peculiarity gives rise to a non-zero $T_c$ even at large $N$[Y.

In a conventional BCS-type superconductor $A(\\omega)$ and\n$N(\\omega)$ are peaked at the gap value $\\Delta (T)$, and the peak position\nshifts to a smaller $\\omega$ as temperature increases, i.e. the gap \"closes\nin\". However when superconductivity is induced by fermions with $\\omega_m = \\pm\n\\pi T$, the peak in $N(\\omega)$ remains at a finite frequency even at $T\n=T_c-0$, the gap just \"fills in\". The spectral function $A(\\omega)$ either\nshows almost the same \"gap filling\" behavior, or its peak position shifts to\nzero frequency already at a finite $\\Delta$ (\"emergent Fermi arc\" behavior),\ndepending on the strength of the thermal contribution.

Since the magnetic field produces the splitting\nof pressures in the directions along and perpendicular to the magnetic axis,\nstable configurations of self-magnetized and magnetized BEC stars are studied\nusing the recently found $\\gamma$-structure equations that describe axially\nsymmetric objects. The magnetized BEC stars are, in general spheroidal, less\nmassive and smaller than the non-magnetic ones, being these effects more\nrelevant at low densities. For the self-magnetized BEC stars their inner\nprofiles of magnetic field can be computed as a function of the equatorial\nradii. The values obtained for the core and surface magnetic fields are in\nagreement with those typical of compact objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Dec 2018 21:56:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

Applied to pions and nucleons, assumed to\nbe fully dressed to all orders, the resulting dressed currents are shown to be\nlocally gauge invariant. Moreover, half-on-shell expressions of (hadron\npropagator)$\\times$(electromagnetic current) needed in all descriptions of\nphysical processes will lose \\textit{all} information about hadronic dressing\nfor real photons. The Ball-Chiu ansatz for the spin-1/2 current is seen to\nsuffer from an incomplete coupling procedure where some essential aspects of\nthe Dirac particle are effectively treated as those of a scalar particle.\nApplied to real Compton scattering on pions and nucleons, we find that\n\\emph{all} dressing information cancels exactly when external hadrons are on\nshell, leaving only gauge-invariant bare Born-type contributions with physical\nmasses.

One of the most fascinating features of biological\nchannel-facilitated transport is a stochastic gating process, when the channels\ndynamically fluctuate between several conformations during the translocation.\nAlthough this phenomenon has been intensively investigated, many properties of\ntranslocation in dynamically changing environment remain not well understood\nmicroscopically. We developed a discrete-state stochastic framework to analyze\nthe molecular mechanisms of transport processes with stochastic gating by\nexplicitly calculating molecular fluxes through the pores. Two scenarios are\nspecifically investigated: 1) symmetry preserving stochastic gating with\nfree-energy changes, and 2) stochastic gating with symmetry changes but without\nmodifications in the overall particle-pore interactions. It is found that\nstochastic gating can both accelerate or slow down the molecular translocation\ndepending on the specific parameters of the system. We argue that biological\nsystems might optimize their performance by utilizing conformational\nfluctuations of channels. Our theoretical analysis clarifies physical-chemical\naspects of the molecular mechanisms of transport with stochastic gating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Dec 2018 23:26:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-20"}

We\nextend the existing methodology for samples of densities in two key directions.\nFirst, motivated by applications in neuroimaging, we consider dependent density\ndata, where a $p$-vector of univariate random densities is observed for each\nsampling unit. Second, we introduce a Wasserstein covariance measure and\npropose intuitively appealing estimators for both fixed and diverging $p$,\nwhere the latter corresponds to continuously-indexed densities.

The present paper considers the\nefficient evaluation of such queries, providing novel optimality guarantees and\nexhibiting good performance on real datasets. We take as a starting point\nFagin's well-known Threshold Algorithm (TA), which can be used to answer cosine\nthreshold queries as follows: an inverted index is first built from the\ndatabase vectors during pre-processing; at query time, the algorithm traverses\nthe index partially to gather a set of candidate vectors to be later verified\nfor {\\theta}-similarity. However, directly applying TA in its raw form misses\nsignificant optimization opportunities. Indeed, we first show that one can take\nadvantage of the fact that the vectors can be assumed to be normalized, to\nobtain an improved, tight stopping condition for index traversal and to\nefficiently compute it incrementally. Then we show that one can take advantage\nof data skewness to obtain better traversal strategies. In particular, we show\na novel traversal strategy that exploits a common data skewness condition which\nholds in multiple domains including mass spectrometry, documents, and image\ndatabases. We show that under the skewness assumption, the new traversal\nstrategy has a strong, near-optimal performance guarantee.

We focus on the 3:2 and 2:1 resonance,\nwhere the trapping may be caused by the convergent migration of a Jupiter- and\nSaturn-mass planet, preceding the common gap formation and ensuing outward (or\ninward) migration. Models show that a common gap also forms in the dust\ncomponent -- similarly to what a single, more massive planet would generate --\nand that outward migration leads to a progressive widening of the dust gap and\nto a decoupling from the gas gap. As the system evolves, a significantly wider\ngap is observed in the dust distribution, which ceases to overlap with the gas\ngap in the inner disk regions. At the outer edge of the gas gap, outward\nmigration of the planets produces an over-density of dust particles, which\nevolve differently in the 3:2 and 2:1 resonances. For the 3:2, the dust trap at\nthe gap's outer edge is partly efficient and a significant fraction of the\ngrains filters through the gap. For the 2:1 resonance, the trap is more\nefficient and very few grains cross the gap, while the vast majority accumulate\nat the outer edge of the gap.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Dec 2018 23:41:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-16"}

Specifically, we design a reweighted graph Laplacian\nregularizer (RGLR) for surface normals and demonstrate its merits in rotation\ninvariance, promotion of piecewise smoothness, and ease of optimization.

With the increasing interest in the field\nto implement QKD over free-space on moving platforms, such as drones, handheld\nsystems, and even satellites, one needs to perform parameter optimization with\nlow latency and with very limited computing power.

We\nstudy two variants that are based on non-reversible Langevin diffusions: the\nunderdamped Langevin dynamics (ULD) and the Langevin dynamics with a\nnon-symmetric drift (NLD). Adopting the techniques of Tzen, Liang and Raginsky\n(2018) for LD to non-reversible diffusions, we show that for a given local\nminimum that is within an arbitrary distance from the initialization, with high\nprobability, either the ULD trajectory ends up somewhere outside a small\nneighborhood of this local minimum within a recurrence time which depends on\nthe smallest eigenvalue of the Hessian at the local minimum or they enter this\nneighborhood by the recurrence time and stay there for a potentially\nexponentially long escape time. The ULD algorithms improve upon the recurrence\ntime obtained for LD in Tzen, Liang and Raginsky (2018) with respect to the\ndependency on the smallest eigenvalue of the Hessian at the local minimum.\nSimilar result and improvement are obtained for the NLD algorithm.

Our\nanalysis suggests that non-reversible Langevin algorithms are more efficient to\nlocate a local minimum as well as exploring the state space.

As described\nin the geomechanics literature, a critical state condition is reached after\nsufficient shearing beyond an initial static packing. During further shearing\nat the critical state, the stress, fabric, and density remain nearly constant,\neven as particles are being continually rearranged. The paper proposes a\npredictive framework for critical state flow, viewing it as a condition of\nmaximum disorder at the micro-scale. The flow model is constructed in a\ntwo-dimensional setting from the probability density of the motions, forces,\nand orientations of inter-particle contacts. Constraints are applied to this\nprobability density: constant mean stress, constant volume, consistency of the\ncontact dissipation rate with the stress work, and the fraction of sliding\ncontacts. The differential form of Shannon entropy, a measure of disorder, is\napplied to the density, and the Jaynes formalism is used to find the density of\nmaximum disorder in the underlying phase space. The resulting distributions of\ncontact force, movement, and orientation are compared with two-dimensional DEM\nsimulations of biaxial compression. The model favorably predicts anisotropies\nof the contact orientations, contact forces, contact movements, and the\norientations of those contacts undergoing slip. The model also predicts the\nrelationships between contact force magnitude and contact motion. The model is\nan alternative to affine-field descriptions of granular flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2018 04:49:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-20"}

To that end vehicles will be\nequipped with diverse sensors, e.g., LIDAR, cameras, mmWave radar, etc.\nUnfortunately the sensing `coverage' is limited by environmental obstructions,\ne.g., other vehicles, buildings, people, objects etc. A possible solution is to\nadopt collaborative sensing amongst vehicles possibly assisted by\ninfrastructure. This paper introduces new models and performance analysis for\nvehicular collaborative sensing and networking. In particular, coverage gains\nare quantified, as are their dependence on the penetration of vehicles\nparticipating in collaborative sensing. We also evaluate the associated\ncommunication loads in terms of the Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and\nVehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) capacity requirements and how these depend on\npenetration. We further explore how collaboration with sensing capable\ninfrastructure improves sensing performance, as well as the benefits in\nutilizing spatio-temporal dynamics, e.g., collaborating with vehicles moving in\nthe opposite direction. Collaborative sensing is shown to greatly improve\nsensing performance, e.g., improves coverage from 20% to 80% with a 20%\npenetration. In scenarios with limited penetration and high coverage\nrequirements, infrastructure can be used to both help sense the environment and\nrelay data. Once penetration is high enough, sensing vehicles provide good\ncoverage and data traffic can be effectively `offloaded' to V2V connectivity,\nmaking V2I resources available to support other in-car services.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2018 06:42:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-20"}

The expression for temperature oscillations follows from\nTolman's law written in Fermi normal coordinates for a comoving observer. The\nmotion of the gas is close to geodesic so the equation of geodesic deviation\nwas used to obtain the expression for temperature oscillations. Then these\noscillations are calculated for some compact stars, quark stars, black holes\nand white dwarfs, using values of electric charge and mass from models found in\nthe literature. Comparing the various models analyzed, it is possible to verify\nthat the role of the charge is the opposite of the mass. While the increase of\nthe mass produces a reduction in the frequencies, amplitude and in the ratio\nbetween the frequencies, the increase of the electric charge produces the\ninverse effect. In addition, it is shown that if the electric charge is\nproportional to the mass, the ratio between the frequencies does not depend on\nthe mass, but only on the proportionality factor between charge and mass. The\nratios between the frequencies for all the models analyzed (except for\nsupermassive black holes in the extreme limit situations) are close to the\n$3/2$ ratio for twin peak quasi-periodic oscillation frequencies, observed in\nmany galactic black holes and neutron star sources in low-mass X-ray binaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2018 07:29:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-20"}

In this context, mafic alkaline magmas (MAM) are characterized by the\nubiquitous stability of clinopyroxene from mantle depths to shallow crustal\nlevels. On one hand, clinopyroxene incorporates REE+Y/HFSE at concentration\nlevels that are much higher than those measured for olivine, plagioclase, and\nmagnetite. On the other hand, the composition of clinopyroxene is highly\nsensitive to variations in pressure, temperature, and melt-water content,\naccording to exchange-equilibria between jadeite and melt, and between\njadeite/Ca-Tschermak and diopside-hedenbergite. As a consequence, the\ndependence of the partition coefficient on the physicochemical state of the\nsystem results in a variety of DREE+Y/DHFSE values that are sensitive to the\nmagmatic conditions at which clinopyroxenes nucleate and grow. In order to\nbetter explore magma dynamics using clinopyroxene, a new P-T-H2O-lattice strain\nmodel specific to MAM compositions has been developed.

When discrepancies are not accounted for\nproperly, posterior uncertainty is underestimated. Furthermore parameters are\ninferred so that model discrepancies appear with observation data stream with\nfew records instead of data streams corresponding to the weak model parts.

The\ncentral challenge in multimodal learning involves inferring joint\nrepresentations that can process and relate information from these modalities.\nHowever, existing work learns joint representations by requiring all modalities\nas input and as a result, the learned representations may be sensitive to noisy\nor missing modalities at test time. With the recent success of sequence to\nsequence (Seq2Seq) models in machine translation, there is an opportunity to\nexplore new ways of learning joint representations that may not require all\ninput modalities at test time. In this paper, we propose a method to learn\nrobust joint representations by translating between modalities. Our method is\nbased on the key insight that translation from a source to a target modality\nprovides a method of learning joint representations using only the source\nmodality as input. We augment modality translations with a cycle consistency\nloss to ensure that our joint representations retain maximal information from\nall modalities. Once our translation model is trained with paired multimodal\ndata, we only need data from the source modality at test time for final\nsentiment prediction. This ensures that our model remains robust from\nperturbations or missing information in the other modalities. We train our\nmodel with a coupled translation-prediction objective and it achieves new\nstate-of-the-art results on multimodal sentiment analysis datasets: CMU-MOSI,\nICT-MMMO, and YouTube.

The correlators need only $M \\leq N+1$ distinct measurement\nsettings, as opposed to the $2^{2N}-1$ settings that would normally be required\nto tomographically verify their associated stabilizer states. We optimize the\nmeasurements of these correlators for a physical array of qubits that can be\nnearest-neighbor-coupled using a circuit of controlled-$Z$ gates with constant\ngate depth to form $N$-qubit linear cluster states. We numerically simulate the\nprovided circuits for a realistic scenario with $N=3,...,9$ qubits, using\nranges of $T_1$ energy relaxation times, $T_2$ dephasing times, and\ncontrolled-$Z$ gate-fidelities consistent with Google's 9-qubit superconducting\nchip. The simulations verify the tightness of the fidelity bounds and witness\nnonclassicality for all nine qubits, while also showing ample room for\nimprovement in chip performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2018 09:01:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2019 04:51:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-29"}

Starting from a tight-binding model for the normal phase of\nBi$_{2}$Se$_{3}$ and M$_{x}$Bi$_{2}$Se$_{3}$, we firstly construct the pairing\nchannels in the spin-orbital basis, up to second-nearest-neighbor pairing\ncorrelations in the basal plane. We then infer the properties of these pairings\nby transforming them to the band (pseudospin) basis for the conduction band. A\ncomparison with the key experimental consensuses on M$_{x}$Bi$_{2}$Se$_{3}$\nsuperconductors shows that the true pairings should also be multichannel.\nBesides a nematic and time-reversal symmetric pairing combination, the other\npairings that we have identified are chiral and nematic at the same time, which\nmay be nonunitary and have a spontaneous magnetization. A complementary set of\nexperiments are proposed to identify the true pairing symmetries of these\nsuperconductors and their evolution with the doping concentration $x$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2018 09:27:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-26"}

We analyze the X-ray spectra extracted from\nboth regions and find that (1) the ICM temperature and the metal abundance in\nthe positive excess are lower and higher than those in the negative excess,\nrespectively, and (2) the ICM is nearly in pressure equilibrium. We also find a\nslight redshift difference between the positive and the negative excesses,\nwhich corresponds to the velocity shear of $1680^{+1300}_{-920}$ km s$^{-1}$\n($1\\sigma$). The X-ray residual image and the ICM properties are consistent\nwith those expected by line-of-sight gas sloshing.

User grouping strategies have significant impact on the power\nconsumption and system performance. However, existing related studies divide\nusers into groups based on channel conditions, where diverse quality of service\n(QoS) and interference have not been considered. In this paper, we focus on the\ninterference-aware user grouping strategy in NOMA systems, aiming at minimizing\npower consumption with QoS constraints. We define a power consumption and\nexternality (PCE) function for each user to represent the power consumption\ninvolved by this user to satisfy its QoS requirement as well as interference\nthat this user brings to others in the same group. Then, we extend the\ndefinition of PCE to multi-user scenarios and convert the user grouping problem\ninto the problem of searching for specific negative loops in the graph.\nBellman-Ford algorithm is extended to find these negative loops. Furthermore, a\ngreedy suboptimal algorithm is proposed to approach the solution within\npolynomial time.

Scrum is one method that supports agile\nworking. Empirical research on the Scrum Master role remains scarce and reveals\ncontradicting results. While the Scrum Master role is often centred on one\nperson in rather immature teams, the role is expected to be shared among\nmultiple members in mature teams. Objective: Therefore, we aim to understand\nhow the Scrum Master role changes while the team matures. Method: We applied\nGrounded Theory and conducted qualitative interviews with 53 practitioners of\n29 software and non-software project teams from Robert Bosch GmbH. Results: We\ndiscovered that Scrum Masters initially plays nine leadership roles which they\ntransfer to the team while it matures. Roles can be transferred by providing a\nleadership gap, which allows team members to take on a leadership role, and by\nproviding an internal team environment with communication on equal terms,\npsychological safety, transparency, shared understanding, shared purpose and\nself-efficacy.

In this paper, we present an efficient method to\nremove rain streaks. First, the location map of rain pixels needs to be known\nas precisely as possible, to which we implement a relatively accurate detection\nof rain streaks by utilizing two characteristics of rain streaks.The key\ncomponent of our method is to represent the intensity of each detected rain\npixel using a linear model: $p=\\alpha s + \\beta$, where $p$ is the observed\nintensity of a rain pixel and $s$ represents the intensity of the background\n(i.e., before rain-affected). To solve $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ for each detected\nrain pixel, we concentrate on a window centered around it and form an\n$L_2$-norm cost function by considering all detected rain pixels within the\nwindow, where the corresponding rain-removed intensity of each detected rain\npixel is estimated by some neighboring non-rain pixels. By minimizing this cost\nfunction, we determine $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ so as to construct the final\nrain-removed pixel intensity.

DNA selectivity provides direct control over\ncolloid-colloid interactions allowing the engineering of structures such as\ncomplex crystals or gels. However, self-assembly of localized and finite\nstructures remains an open problem with many potential applications. In this\nwork, we present a system in which functionalized surfaces initiate a cascade\nreaction between linkers leading to self-assembly of crystals with a\ncontrollable number of layers. Specifically, we consider colloidal particles\nfunctionalized by two families of complementary DNA linkers with mobile\nanchoring points, as found in experiments using emulsions or lipid bilayers. In\nbulk, intra-particle linkages formed by pairs of complementary linkers prevent\nthe formation of inter-particle bridges and therefore colloid-colloid\naggregation. However, colloids interact strongly with the surface given that\nthe latter can destabilize intra-particle linkages. When in direct contact with\nthe surface, colloids are activated, meaning that they feature more unpaired\nDNA linkers ready to react. Activated colloids can then capture and activate\nother colloids from the bulk through the formation of inter-particle linkages.\nUsing simulations and theory, validated by existing experiments, we clarify the\nthermodynamics of the activation and binding process and explain how\nparticle-particle interactions, within the adsorbed phase, weaken as a function\nof the distance from the surface. The latter observation underlies the\npossibility of self-assembling finite aggregates with controllable thickness\nand flat solid-gas interfaces.

This paper proposes non-orthogonal\nmultiple-access (NOMA) assisted semi-grant-free (SGF) transmission, which is a\ncompromise between grant-free and grant-based schemes. In particular, instead\nof reserving channels either for grant-based users or grant-free users, we\nfocus on an SGF communication scenario, where users are admitted to the same\nchannel via a combination of grant-based and grant-free protocols. As a result,\na channel reserved by a grant-based user can be shared by grant-free users,\nwhich improves both connectivity and spectral efficiency. Two NOMA assisted SGF\ncontention control mechanisms are developed to ensure that, with a small amount\nof signalling overhead, the number of admitted grant-free users is carefully\ncontrolled and the interference from the grant-free users to the grant-based\nusers is effectively suppressed. Analytical results are provided to demonstrate\nthat the two proposed SGF mechanisms employing different successive\ninterference cancelation decoding orders are applicable to different practical\nnetwork scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2018 11:22:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-20"}

This article seeks to provide some assistance in understanding the\nfundamental issues regarding environmental contours and their use in structural\nreliability analysis.

Hence, quantum phenomena are not considered to\nbe relevant for the design of efficient and controllable energy transfer over\nsignificant length and time scales. Contrary to this conventional wisdom, here\nwe show that the robust quantum properties of small configurations of repeating\nclusters of molecules can be used to tune energy transfer mechanism that take\nplace on much larger scales. With the support of an exactly solvable model, we\ndemonstrate that coherent exciton delocalization and dark states within unit\ncells can be used to harness dissipative phenomena of varying nature\n(thermalization, fluorescence, non-radiative decay and weak inter-site\ncorrelations) to support classical propagation over macroscopic distances. In\nparticular, we argue that coherent delocalization of electronic excitations\nover just a few pigments can drastically alter the relevant dissipation\npathways which influence the energy transfer mechanism, and thus serve as a\nmolecular control tool for large-scale properties of molecular materials.\nBuilding on these principles, we use extensive numerical simulations to\ndemonstrate that they can explain currently not understood measurements of\nmicron-scale exciton diffusion in nano-fabricated arrays of bacterial\nphotosynthetic complexes. Based on these results we provide quantum design\nguidelines at the molecular scale to optimize both energy transfer speed and\nrange over macroscopic distances in artificial light-harvesting architectures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2018 12:13:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Apr 2019 12:18:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 2021 13:40:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-13"}

Aims: To determine the\nscaling of overshooting depth ($d_{\\rm os}$) at the base of the convection zone\nas a function of imposed energy flux ($\\mathscr{F}_{\\rm n}$) and to estimate\nthe extent of overshooting at the base of the solar convection zone. Methods:\nThree-dimensional Cartesian simulations of compressible non-rotating convection\nwith unstable and stable layers are used. The simulations use either a fixed\nheat conduction profile or a temperature and density dependent formulation\nbased on Kramers opacity law. The simulations cover a range of almost four\norders of magnitude in the imposed flux. Results: A smooth heat conduction\nprofile (either fixed or through Kramers opacity law) leads to a relatively\nshallow power law with $d_{\\rm os}\\propto \\mathscr{F}_{\\rm n}^{0.08}$ for low\n$\\mathscr{F}_{\\rm n}$.

However, the opposite case, selectively\nbinding to surfaces with a receptor density below a given threshold, is much\nharder. Here, we present a simple strategy for selectively targeting a surface\nwith a low density of receptors, within a system also having a surface with a\nhigher density of the same receptors. Our strategy exploits competitive\nadsorption of two species. The first species, called \"guards\", are\nreceptor-sized monovalent particles designed to occupy the high-density surface\nat equilibrium, while the second multivalent \"attacker\" species outcompetes the\nguards for binding onto the low-density surface. Surprisingly, the recipe for\nattackers and guards yields more selective binding with stronger\nligand-receptor association constants, in contrast to standard multivalency. We\nderive explicit expressions for the attacker and guard molecular design\nparameters and concentrations, optimised within bounds of what is\nexperimentally accessible, thereby facilitating implementation of the proposed\napproach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2018 13:04:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Apr 2019 14:54:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-05"}

The first scenario is the relays only\nscenario, where the task requests are processed using relays only. The second\nscenario is the objects only scenario, where the task requests are processed\nusing the IoT objects only. The last scenario is a hybrid scenario, where the\ntask requests are processed using both IoT objects and VMs. We have developed a\nmixed integer linear programming (MILP) model to maximize the number of\nprocessing tasks served by the system and minimize the total power consumed by\nthe IoT network.

For a better interpretation of this phenomenon, we use Gaia DR2\nparallaxes, to analyse distances of young stellar objects, using them as proxy\nfor cloud distances. We find that the ONC region indeed lies at about 400 pc\nwhile the low-mass star-forming parts are inclined about 70$^\\circ$ from the\nplane of the sky reaching until $\\sim$470 pc. With this we estimate that Orion\nA is an about 90 pc long filamentary cloud (about twice as long as previously\nassumed), with its \"Head\" (the ONC region) being \"bent\" and oriented toward the\ngalactic mid-plane. This striking new view allows us to perform a more robust\nanalysis of this important star-forming region in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2018 15:35:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-20"}

In this work,\nwe characterise the mid-J CO emission in a statistical sample of 99 clumps\n(Top100) selected from the ATLASGAL survey that are representative of the\nGalactic proto-cluster population.

The CO line luminosity is correlated with the\nluminosity and mass of the clumps. However, it does not correlate with the L/M\nratio. The dependency of the CO luminosity with the properties of the clumps is\nsteeper for higher-J transitions. Our data seem to exclude that this trend is\nbiased by self-absorption features in the CO emission, but rather suggest that\ndifferent J transitions arise from different regions of the inner envelope.\nMoreover, high-mass clumps show similar trends in CO luminosity as lower mass\nclumps, but are systematically offset towards larger values, suggesting that\nhigher column density and/or temperature (of unresolved) CO emitters are found\ninside high-mass clumps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2018 14:43:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 6 Jan 2019 14:03:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-13"}

However, most of the research\nliterature merely focuses on the \\textit{worst-case} setting where the input of\nthe neural network is perturbed with noises that are constrained within an\n$\\ell_p$ ball; and several algorithms have been proposed to compute certified\nlower bounds of minimum adversarial distortion based on such worst-case\nanalysis.

In a naive picture the latter are directly related to the impact\nparameter of the two nuclei, which sets also the initial eccentricity of the\nsystem: zero in the case of the most central events and getting larger for more\nperipheral collisions. A more realistic modelling requires to take into account\nevent-by-event fluctuations, in particular in the nucleon positions within the\ncolliding nuclei: collisions belonging to the same centrality class can give\nrise to systems with different initial eccentricity and hence different flow\nharmonics for the final hadron distributions. This issue can be addressed by an\nevent-shape-engineering analysis, consisting in selecting events with the same\ncentrality but different magnitude of the average bulk anisotropic flow and\ntherefore of the initial-state eccentricity. In this paper we present the\nimplementation of this analysis in the POWLANG transport model, providing\npredictions for the transverse-momentum and angular distributions of charm and\nbeauty hadrons for event-shape selected collisions. In this way it is possible\nto get information on how the heavy quarks propagating (and hadronizing) in a\nhot environment respond both to its energy density and to its geometric\nasymmetry, breaking the perfect correlation between eccentricity and impact\nparameter which characterizes a modelling of the medium based on smooth average\ninitial conditions\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2018 15:30:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-26"}

However, most deep learning-based techniques are\nbuilt on two-stage, proposal-driven detectors and using less complex image\ndata, which is not promising to promote practical applications and integration\nwithin intelligent autonomous inspection systems. In this study, a faster,\nsimpler single-stage detector is proposed based on YOLOv3 for detecting\nmultiple concrete damages of highway bridges.

However, most existing face restoration models\nomit the multiple scale issues in face restoration problem, which is still not\nwell-solved in research area. In this paper, we propose a Sequential Gating\nEnsemble Network (SGEN) for multi-scale noise robust face restoration issue. To\nendow the network with multi-scale representation ability, we first employ the\nprinciple of ensemble learning for SGEN network architecture designing. The\nSGEN aggregates multi-level base-encoders and base-decoders into the network,\nwhich enables the network to contain multiple scales of receptive field.\nInstead of combining these base-en/decoders directly with non-sequential\noperations, the SGEN takes base-en/decoders from different levels as sequential\ndata. Specifically, it is visualized that SGEN learns to sequentially extract\nhigh level information from base-encoders in bottom-up manner and restore low\nlevel information from base-decoders in top-down manner. Besides, we propose to\nrealize bottom-up and top-down information combination and selection with\nSequential Gating Unit (SGU). The SGU sequentially takes information from two\ndifferent levels as inputs and decides the output based on one active input.\nExperiment results on benchmark dataset demonstrate that our SGEN is more\neffective at multi-scale human face restoration with more image details and\nless noise than state-of-the-art image restoration models. Further utilizing\nadversarial training scheme, SGEN also produces more visually preferred results\nthan other models under subjective evaluation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2018 11:53:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-01"}

A classic structure of\nPM-type OPDs is based on the active layer of P3HT:PC70BM with the weight ratio\nof 100:1, in which PC70BM forms islands and supply bulk electron traps for\ninducing strong interfacial band bending and thus hole tunneling from the Al\nelectrode. In this paper, aiming for optimizing the PM effect, we study the\nphotogenerated carrier distribution by tuning thickness of the active layer\n(P3HT:PC70BM). The combination effect of both the exciton generation and\nexciton dissociation processes affects the photogenerated carrier distribution,\nwhich ultimately determines the PM performances of OPDs. On the one hand,\nsimulation reveals that the thinner the active layer, the stronger exciton\ngeneration near the Al electrode. On the other hand, the photoluminescence and\nsurface morphology studies reflect that the active layer with thickness of 230\nnm has the smooth surface and produces the highest exciton dissociation rate.\nThe two effects result in the OPD with a 205 nm thick active layer has the\nchampion EQE (105569%) and photoresponsivity (344 A/W), corresponding to an\nenhancement of 330% with respect to the OPD with a 325 nm thick active layer.\nAscribed to the trade off of EQE and dark current, the detectivity performs\ndifferently at different wavelength ranges. At short wavelength range, the\ndetectivity reaches the highest when the active layer is 205 nm thick, while\nthe highest detectivity at long wavelength range is produced by the thickest\nactive layer.
