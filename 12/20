The former process is\nimportant for measuring the coupling of the Higgs boson to weak bosons, whereas\nthe latter process plays an important role in determining any $CP$-admixtures\nin the Higgs sector. In this paper we go beyond the current state-of-the-art\nfor fixed order calculations of the GF process (i.e. one loop $H+2j$ including\nfull quark mass effects) by including the all-order effects in leading\n$\\log(\\hat s/p_t^2)$, together with full quark mass and loop-propagator\nkinematic effects.

The mass\ndependence is more significant than at fixed order, because the systematic\ninclusion of the leading logarithms in $\\hat s/p_t^2$ results in a hardening of\nthe transverse momentum of the Higgs boson, which in turn probes in more detail\nthe loop-structure of the coupling. In particular, the full mass dependence\nreduces the cross section within VBF cuts by 11\\% compared to a calculation\nbased just on the infinite top mass limit, but the impact of the bottom quark\nremains small.

In this system the kinetic energy of the low-energy electrons\nis much reduced and consequently interactions become very relevant, providing a\nnew platform into the physics of two-dimensional correlated materials. Evidence\nof a proposed Mott insulating as well as superconducting state in these highly\ntunable systems has spurred much attention as they could pave the way to\nunderstanding long-standing questions of high-$T_c$ superconductivity or\nprovide candidate systems for topological chiral superconductors; key to highly\nrelevant quantum technologies. Here, we demonstrate that twisted bilayer boron\nnitride (TBBN) is an exciting and even richer alternative to twisted bilayer\ngraphene (TBG).

Therefore, in scenarios where it is not\nenough to know that a particle stays on the right trajectory but one needs to\nknow where on the trajectory the particle is at a given time, Boris method\nrequires very small time steps to deliver accurate phase information, making it\ncomputationally expensive.

We make use of the lensing reconstruction code SaWLens2 and\nexpand its capabilities by incorporating an estimate of the projected\ngravitational potential based on X-ray data that are deprojected using the\nlocal Richardson-Lucy method and used to infer the Newtonian potential of the\ncluster and we discuss how potentially arising numerical artefacts can be\ntreated. We demonstrate the feasibility of our method on a simplified mock NFW\nhalo and on a cluster from a realistic hydrodynamical simulation and show how\nthe combination of X-ray and weak lensing data can affect a free-form\nreconstruction, improving the accuracy in the central region in some cases by a\nfactor of two.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2018 18:47:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Jul 2019 10:19:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-17"}

In particular, if a graph allows a cyclic graph clustering\nwith a sufficient number of clusters or contains a sufficiently long induced\nsubpath without cut vertices of the graph then there is a non-synchronous\nstable phase-locked solution.

However, even in the presence of a dark matter\nhalo, other galactic-scale observations, such as the Baryonic Tully-Fisher\nRelation and the Radial Acceleration Relation, remain challenging to explain.\nThis has motivated long-distance, infrared modifications to gravity as an\nalternative to the dark matter hypothesis as well as various DM theories with\nsimilar phenomenology. In general, the standard lore has been that any model\nthat reduces to the phenomenology of MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) on\ngalactic scales explains essentially all galaxy-scale observables. We present a\nframework to test precisely this statement using local Milky Way observables,\nincluding the vertical acceleration field, the rotation curve, the baryonic\nsurface density, and the stellar disk profile. We focus on models that predict\nscalar amplifications of gravity, i.e., models that increase the magnitude but\ndo not change the direction of the gravitational acceleration. We find that\nmodels of this type are disfavored relative to a simple dark matter halo model\nbecause the Milky Way data requires a substantial amplification of the radial\nacceleration with little amplification of the vertical acceleration. We\nconclude that models which result in a MOND-like force struggle to\nsimultaneously explain both the rotational velocity and vertical motion of\nnearby stars in the Milky Way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2018 19:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 2019 11:13:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-23"}

The star brightened to $\\sim$2\nCrab in the X-ray regime within hours before decaying to a quiescent level in\nless than 2 weeks, clearly indicative of binarity. Since the outburst of CI\nCam, a number of sgB[e] stars have been identified as X-ray overluminous for a\nsingle star (i.e. $L_X > 10^{-7}~L_{bol}$). This small population has recently\nexpanded to include two Ultra Luminous X-ray sources (ULX), Holmberg II X-1 and\nNGC300 ULX-1/supernova imposter SN2010da. We revisit CI Cam to investigate its\nbehaviour over several timescales and shed further light on the nature of the\ncompact object in the system, its X-ray outburst in 1998 and the binary system\nparameters. We analyse archival XMM-Newton EPIC-pn spectra and light curves\nalong with new data from Swift and NuSTAR. We also present high-resolution\nMERCATOR/HERMES optical spectra, including a spectrum taken 1.02 days after our\nNuSTAR observation. Despite being in quiescence, CI Cam is highly X-ray\nvariable on timescales of days, both in terms of total integrated flux and\nspectral shape. We interpret these variations by invoking the presence of an\naccreting compact companion immersed in a dense, highly structured, aspherical\ncircumstellar envelope. The differences in the accretion flux and circumstellar\nextinction represent either changes in this environment, triggered by variable\nmass loss from the star, or the local conditions to the accretor due to its\norbital motion. We find no evidence for pulsations in the X-ray light curve. CI\nCam has many similarities with SN2010da across mid-IR, optical and X-ray\nwavelengths suggesting that, subject to distance determination for CI Cam, if\nCI Cam was located in an external galaxy its 1998 outburst would have led to a\nclassification as a supernova imposter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2018 19:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-06"}

During inflation, the vacuum remains\nin the unbroken GUT phase, and GUT symmetry breaking occurs later when a field\nwith a flat direction (the flaton) acquires a vacuum expectation value.\nInflaton decay and the reheating process depend crucially on GUT symmetry\nbreaking, as decay channels open and close, depending on the value of the\nflaton vacuum expectation value. Here, we consider the simultaneous\ncosmological evolution of both the inflaton and flaton fields after inflation.\nWe distinguish weak, moderate and strong reheating regimes, and calculate in\neach case the entropy produced as all fields settle to their global minima.\nThese three reheating scenarios differ in the value of a Yukawa coupling that\nintroduces mass mixing between the singlets and the ${\\bf 10}$s of SU(5).

We provide strong evidence that the threshold error rate of the\nsurface code tracks the hashing bound exactly for all biases, and show how to\nexploit these features to achieve significant improvement in logical failure\nrate. First, we consider the infinite bias limit, meaning pure dephasing.

We demonstrate that\nthe sub-threshold behavior of the code depends critically on the precise shape\nand boundary conditions of the code. That is, for rectangular surface codes\nwith standard rough/smooth open boundaries, it is controlled by the parameter\n$g=\\gcd(j,k)$, where $j$ and $k$ are dimensions of the surface code lattice. We\ndemonstrate a significant improvement in logical failure rate with pure\ndephasing for co-prime codes that have $g=1$, and closely-related rotated\ncodes, which have a modified boundary. The effect is dramatic: the same logical\nfailure rate achievable with a square surface code and $n$ physical qubits can\nbe obtained with a co-prime or rotated surface code using only $O(\\sqrt{n})$\nphysical qubits. Finally, we use approximate maximum likelihood decoding to\ndemonstrate that this improvement persists for a general Pauli noise biased\ntowards dephasing.

This trend has been\ninterpreted as evidence for the slow and gradual formation of dust in CCSNe.\nObservationally, the trend exhibits a $ t^2$ behavior, exactly what is expected\nfrom an expanding optically thick ejecta.

We find that evolutionary algorithms are\nable to effectively explore the parameter space of biophysical properties\nwithin the agent-based simulations, minimising the resulting number of\ncancerous cells after a period of simulated treatment. Both model-assisted\nalgorithms are found to outperform a standard evolutionary algorithm,\ndemonstrating their ability to perform a more effective search within the very\nsmall evaluation budget. This represents the first use of efficient\nevolutionary algorithms within a high-throughput multicellular computing\napproach to find therapeutic design optima that maximise tumour regression.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2018 21:28:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Mar 2019 15:05:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 14 May 2019 16:06:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-05"}

The paper implements a methodology for characterizing the incremental\nstiffness of a granular assembly during biaxial loading, with orthotropic\nloading increments that preserve the principal axes of the fabric and stiffness\ntensors. The linear part of the hypoplastic tangential stiffness is monitored\nwith oedometric loading increments. This stiffness increases in the direction\nof the initial compressive loading but decreases in the direction of extension.\nAnisotropy of this stiffness is closely correlated with a particular measure of\nthe contact fabric. Permeabilities are measured in three directions with\nlattice Boltzmann methods at various stages of loading and for assemblies with\nfour particle shapes. Effective permeability is negatively correlated with the\ndirectional mean free path and is positively correlated with pore width.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2018 22:08:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-21"}

In the scheme, two modes are coupled with each\nother both by a direct binary interaction and by an indirect interaction\nthrough a third intermediate damping mode, creating interference effects\ndetermined by the relative phase between the two physical interaction paths. By\ncalculating the populations and correlations of the two modes, we show that\ndepending on the phase, two modes can be prepared into an entangled steady\nstate with asymmetric and directional steering even if they possess completely\nsymmetric decoherence properties. Meanwhile, entanglement and steering can be\nsignificantly enhanced due to constructive interference, and thus more robust\nto thermal noises.

On these scanners, while\nhalf-scan data is strictly sufficient to produce images with the best temporal\nresolution, acquiring a full 360 degree rotation worth of data is beneficial\nfor wide-cone image reconstruction at negligible additional radiation dose.\nApplying Model-Based Iterative Reconstruction (MBIR) algorithm to the heart has\nshown to yield significant enhancement in image quality for cardiac CT. But\nimaging the heart in large cone angle geometry leads to apparently conflicting\ndata usage considerations. On the one hand, in addition to using the fastest\navailable scanner rotation speed, a minimal complete data set of 180 degrees\nplus the fan angle is typically used to minimize both cardiac and respiratory\nmotion. On the other hand, a full 360 degree acquisition helps better handle\nthe challenges of missing frequencies and incomplete projections associated\nwith wide-cone half-scan data acquisition. In this paper, we develop a\nSpatially Adaptive sinogram Weights MBIR algorithm (SAW-MBIR) that is designed\nto achieve the benefits of both half and full-scan reconstructions in order to\nmaximize temporal resolution over the heart region while providing stable\nresults over the whole volume covered with the wide-area detector.\nSpatially-adaptive sinogram weights applied to each projection measurement in\nSAW-MBIR are designed to selectively perform backprojection from the full and\nhalf-scan portion of the sinogram based on both projection angle and\nreconstructed voxel location.

Such subspaces are typically\ncomputed using methods such as balanced truncation, rational interpolation, the\nreduced-basis method, and (balanced) POD. Unfortunately, restricting the state\nto evolve in a linear subspace imposes a fundamental limitation to the accuracy\nof the resulting reduced-order model (ROM). In particular, linear-subspace ROMs\ncan be expected to produce low-dimensional models with high accuracy only if\nthe problem admits a fast decaying Kolmogorov $n$-width (e.g.,\ndiffusion-dominated problems). Unfortunately, many problems of interest exhibit\na slowly decaying Kolmogorov $n$-width (e.g., advection-dominated problems). To\naddress this, we propose a novel framework for projecting dynamical systems\nonto nonlinear manifolds using minimum-residual formulations at the\ntime-continuous and time-discrete levels; the former leads to manifold Galerkin\nprojection, while the latter leads to manifold least-squares Petrov--Galerkin\n(LSPG) projection.

Achieving an accurate model of\ninterstellar dust is therefore of great importance. Interstellar dust models\nare usually built based on observational constraints such as starlight\nextinction and polarization, but dynamical constraints such as grain rotation\nare not considered. In this paper, we show that a newly discovered effect by\nHoang et al., so-called RAdiative Torque Disruption (RATD), can act as an\nimportant dynamical constraint for dust models. Using this dynamical\nconstraint, we derive the maximum size of grains that survive in the ISM for\ndifferent dust models, including contact binary, composite, silicate-core, and\namorphous carbon mantle, and compact grain model for the different radiation\nfields. We find that the different dust models have different maximum size due\nto their different tensile strengths, and the largest maximum size corresponds\nto compact grains with the highest tensile strength. We show that the composite\ngrain model cannot be ruled out if constituent particles are very small with\nradius $a_{p}\\le$ 25 nm, but large composite grains would be destroyed if the\nparticles are large with $a_{p}\\ge 50$ nm. We suggest that grain internal\nstructures can be constrained with observations using the dynamical RATD\nconstraint for strong radiation fields such as supernova, nova, or star-forming\nregions. Finally, our obtained results suggest that micron-sized grains perhaps\nhave compact/core-mantle structures or have composite structures but located in\nregions with slightly higher gas density and weaker radiation intensity than\nthe average ISM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Dec 2018 07:13:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 29 Dec 2018 12:19:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 16 Mar 2019 01:02:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-01"}

Specifically, the campus based commercial buildings make the major\ncontributions to peak demand in a distribution system. Note that prior works\nneglect the consumers comfort level in performing demand response, which limits\ntheir applications as the incentives are not worth as compared to the loss in\ncomfort levels for most time. Thus, a framework to comprehensively consider\nboth operating costs and comfort levels is necessary. Moreover, distributed\nenergy resources are widely deployed in commercial buildings such as roof top\nsolar panels, plug in electric vehicles, and energy storage units, which bring\nvarious uncertainties to the distribution systems, i.e., output of renewable;\nelectricity prices; arrival and departure of plug-in electric vehicles;\nbusiness hour demand response signals and flexible energy demand. In this\npaper, we propose an optimal demand response framework to enable local control\nof demand-side appliances that are usually too small to participate in a retail\nelectricity market. Several typical small demand side appliances, i.e.,\nheating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems, electric water heaters and\nplug-in electric vehicles, are considered in our proposed model. Their\noperations are coordinated by a central controller, whose objective is to\nminimize the total cost and maximize the customers comfort levels for multiple\ncommercial buildings. A scenario-based stochastic programming is leveraged to\nhandle the aforementioned uncertainties. Numerical results based on the\npractical data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. In\naddition, the trade off between the operation costs of commercial buildings and\ncustomers comfort levels is illustrated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Dec 2018 08:28:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-21"}

As each blockchain is designed to\nsupport specific types of assets and transactions, and no blockchain will\nprevail, the need to perform interblockchain transactions is already pressing.\n  In this work we examine the fundamental problem of interoperable and\ninterconnected blockchains. In particular, we begin by introducing the\nMulti-Distributed Ledger Objects (MDLO), which is the result of aggregating\nmultiple Distributed Ledger Objects -- DLO (a DLO is a formalization of the\nblockchain) and that supports append and get operations of records (e.g.,\ntransactions) in them from multiple clients concurrently. Next, we define the\nAtomicAppends problem, which emerges when the exchange of digital assets\nbetween multiple clients may involve appending records in more than one DLO.\nSpecifically, AtomicAppend requires that either all records will be appended on\nthe involved DLOs or none. We examine the solvability of this problem assuming\nrational and risk-averse clients that may fail by crashing, and under different\nclient utility and append models, timing models, and client failure scenarios.\nWe show that for some cases the existence of an intermediary is necessary for\nthe problem solution. We propose the implementation of such intermediary over a\nspecialized blockchain, we term Smart DLO (SDLO), and we show how this can be\nused to solve the AtomicAppends problem even in an asynchronous, client\ncompetitive environment, where all the clients may crash.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Dec 2018 09:47:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-21"}

Beyond mainly anecdotal evidence\n(interviews, on-line discussions), incident reports, and surveys, we are\nmissing open, large-scale, and long-term investigations that promote knowledge\ntransfer and research validation. We explore means for work safety\npractitioners rely on, factors influencing their performance, and their\nperception of their role in the system life cycle.

We analyse and present the responses of 124\npractitioners in safety-critical system and software projects.

Device\nrotation is particularly challenging, as a handheld device may rotate\nsignificantly over a very short period of time, causing it to lose the\nconnection to the Access Point (AP) unless the rotation is accompanied by\nimmediate beam realignment. We study how to maintain the link to a mm-wave AP\nunder rotation and without any input from inertial sensors, exploiting the fact\nthat mm-wave devices will typically be multi-band. We present a model that maps\nTime-of-Flight measurements to rotation and propose a method to infer the\nrotation speed of the mobile terminal using only measurements from sub-6 GHz\nWiFi. We also use the same sub-6 GHz WiFi system to reduce the angle error\nestimate for link establishment, exploiting the spatial geometry of the\ndeployed APs and a statistical model that maps the user position's spatial\ndistribution to an angle error distribution. We leverage these findings to\nintroduce SLASH, a Statistical Location and rotation-Aware beam SearcH\nalgorithm that adaptively narrows the sector search space and accelerates both\nlink establishment and maintenance between mm-wave devices. We evaluate SLASH\nwith experiments conducted indoors with a sub-6 GHz WiFi Time-of-Flight\npositioning system and a 60-GHz testbed. SLASH can increase the data rate by\nmore than 41% for link establishment and 67% for link maintenance with respect\nto prior work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Dec 2018 10:26:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-21"}

We derived the matching conditions for\nthe spherically symmetric singular hypersurface (in our case it is equivalent\nto the world line) in the Weyl$+$Einstein gravity. It was found, that the\nresidual extrinsic curvature tensor of this surface must be continuous on the\nsingular hypersurface. The result is the same as that found by Senovilla, it is\ndictated by the very possibility to have the double layer, but the jump in the\nnormal derivative of the radius may be not zero. It was found that in the\npresence of the double layer, the matching conditions contain an arbitrary\nfunction, and this result is quite new and very important. One of the\nconsequences of such freedom is that the trace of the extrinsic curvature\ntensor of the singular hypersurface is necessarily equal to zero. We suggested\nthe physical interpretation for the $S_0^n$ and $S_n^n$ components of the\nsurface matter energy-momentum tensor of the shell. In General Relativity they\nare zero by virtue of the Einstein equations. In the quadratic gravity they are\nnot necessarily zero. Our interpretation is that these components describe the\nenergy flow $(S^{0n})$ and the momentum transfer $(S^{nn})$ of the particles\nproduced by the double layer itself. Moreover, the requirement of the zero\ntrace of the extrinsic curvature tensor (mentioned above) implies that\n$S_n^n=0$, and this fact also support our suggestion, because it means that for\nthe observer sitting on the shell, the particles will be seen created by pairs,\nand the sum of their momentum transfers must zero.

We propose a stochastic\nGalerkin reduced basis (SGRB) method as a means to lower the computational\nburden when statistical outputs are required for a large number of\ndeterministic parameter queries. Our working assumption is that we have access\nto the computational resources necessary to set up such a reduced order model\nfor a spatial-stochastic weak formulation of the parameter-dependent BVP.\n  To derive an SGRB model, we project the spatial-stochastic weak solution of a\nparameter-dependent SGFE model onto a POD reduced basis generated from\nsnapshots of SGFE solutions at representative values of the parameter. We\npropose residual-corrected estimates of the parameter-dependent expectation and\nvariance of linear functional outputs and provide respective computable error\nbounds.~We test the SGRB method numerically for a convection-diffusion-reaction\nproblem, choosing the convective velocity as a deterministic parameter and the\nparametrized reactivity field as a random input. Compared to a standard reduced\nbasis model embedded in a Monte Carlo sampling procedure, the SGRB model\nrequires a similar number of reduced basis functions to meet a given tolerance\nrequirement.

Although the two\nmethods should give the same results theoretically, qualitatively different\nresults have been reported. Recently, we pointed out that the separation of the\nground state from the excited states is crucial to obtain sensible results in\nthe former, while both states provide useful signals in the latter. In this\npaper, we identify the contribution of each state in the direct method by\ndecomposing the two-baryon correlators into the finite-volume eigenmodes\nobtained from the HAL QCD method. We consider the $\\Xi\\Xi$ system in the\n$^1$S$_0$ channel at $m_\\pi = 0.51$ GeV in 2+1 flavor lattice QCD using the\nwall and smeared quark sources. We demonstrate that the \"pseudo-plateau\" at\nearly time slices (t = 1~2 fm) from the smeared source in the direct method\nindeed originates from the contamination of the excited states, and the true\nplateau with the ground state saturation is realized only at t > 5~15 fm\ncorresponding to the inverse of the lowest excitation energy. We also\ndemonstrate that the two-baryon operator can be optimized by utilizing the\nfinite-volume eigenmodes, so that (i) the finite-volume energy spectra from the\nHAL QCD method agree with those from the optimized temporal correlator and (ii)\nthe correct spectra would be accessed in the direct method only if highly\noptimized operators are employed. Thus we conclude that the long-standing issue\non the consistency between the L\\\"uscher's finite volume method and the HAL QCD\nmethod for two baryons is now resolved: They are consistent with each other\nquantitatively only if the excited contamination is properly removed in the\nformer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Dec 2018 13:02:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Mar 2019 15:19:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-07"}

As a consequence it has not\nbeen possible to obtain interaction energies vanishing at infinite intermonomer\ndistance $R$. This has dramatically reduced the accuracy of calculations at\ndistances where the error in the dimer energy was comparable with the\ninteraction energy itself. The same problem occurs in calculations of\ninteraction-induced properties. In this communication we show how to circumvent\nthis difficulty and obtain interaction energies or interaction-induced\nproperties that vanish at large $R$. This is achieved by relaxing the Pauli\nprinciple in the diagonalization of the Hamiltonian of noninteracting monomers.\nThe basis functions used for this diagonalization belong to the representation\nof the permutation group of the dimer induced by the product of representations\nappropriate for the monomer spin states. Nonlinear parameters of the basis set\nare optimized only for the dimer in the Pauli-allowed sector of the Hilbert\nspace. In this way, one obtains $R$-dependent energy of noninteracting monomers\nand the corresponding interaction energy includes a counterpoise correction for\nthe basis set superposition error.

The optical network units (ONUs),\nbeing predominantly responsible for the energy consumption of Ethernet Passive\nOptical Network (EPON), motivates us towards designing a novel protocol for\nsaving energy at ONU. The proposed protocol exploits different low power modes\n(LPM) and opts for the suitable one using traffic prediction. This scheme\nprovides a significant improvement of energy-efficiency especially at high load\n(~ 40%) over existing protocols. A better understanding of the performance and\na deeper insight into several design aspects can only be addressed through a\ndetailed mathematical analysis. The proposed protocol involves traffic\nprediction which infringes Markovian property. However, some pragmatic\nassumptions along with a proper selection of observation instances and state\ndescriptions allow us to form a Discrete Time Markov Chain (DTMC) of the\nproposed algorithm. Thus, the primary objective of this paper is to propose a\nnovel scheme for achieving energy-efficiency at ONU and mathematically analyze\nthe performance of it with the help of a DTMC. The analysis reveals that the\nenergy-efficiency is more sensitive to the power consumption of doze mode as\ncompared to other LPM while the effect of sleep-to-wake-up time is minor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Dec 2018 14:39:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-21"}

We\nreport on the fabrication of membrane isolated transition edge sensor\nbolometers incorporating compact (<50 {\\mu}m) thermal isolation beams based on\nphononic filters. Phononic filters are created by etching quasi-periodic\nnanoscale structures into supporting thermo-mechanical beams. The\ncross-sectional dimensions of the etched features are less than the thermal\nwavelength at the operating temperature, enabling coherent phonon transport to\ntake place in one dimension. The phonon stop-band can be tuned by adjusting the\nscale of the quasi-periodic structures. Cascading multiple filter stages can\nincrease bandwidth and provide improved thermal isolation similar to the\nfunction of a multi-stage electrical filter.

In recent years, mechanical resonators have\nentered the stage as universal building block for resonator networks, both for\ntheir well-controlled mechanical properties and for their eigenfrequencies\nconveniently located in the radio-frequency regime. Vertically oriented\nnanomechanical pillar resonators are ideally suited for the dense integration\ninto large resonator networks.

Both, mode\nhybridization and the formation of an avoided level crossing in the response of\nthe nanopillar pair are experimentally observed.

In our setup, three primaries lay at the vertices of an\nequilateral triangle and move in circular orbits around their common center of\nmass. Here, one of the primaries is a radiating body and the fourth body (whose\nmass is negligible) does not affect the motion of the primaries. We show that\nthe existence and the number of equilibrium points of the problem depend on the\nmass parameters and radiation factor. Consequently, the allowed regions of\nmotion, the regions of the basins of convergence for the equilibrium points,\nand the basin entropy will also depend on these parameters. The present\ndynamical model is analyzed for three combinations of mass for the primaries:\nequal masses, two equal masses, different masses. As the main results, we find\nthat in all cases the libration points are unstable if the radiation factor is\nlarger than 0.01 and hence able to destroy the stability of the libration\npoints in the restricted four-body problem composed by Sun, Jupiter, Trojan\nasteroid and a test (dust) particle.

Two central objects are calculated: the\nlattice Fourier transform of the direct local moment - local moment correlation\nfunctions in the paramagnetic state and local internal magnetic fields as\nfunctions of magnetic order. We identify the potentially most stable magnetic\nphases from the first, which can include non-collinear and long-period states\nin complex multi-atom unit cells, and extract higher order correlations among\nthe local moments from the second. We propose that these latter entities\nproduce a picture of effective multi-site magnetic interactions depending on\nthe state and extent of magnetic order and discuss its relation to other\napproaches. We show how magnetic phase diagrams for temperature, magnetic\nfield, and lattice structure and also magnetocaloric and mechanocaloric effects\ncan be obtained from this approach. The theory accurately predicts the order of\ntransitions and quantifies contributions to first-order and order-order\nmagnetic phase transitions from both purely electronic sources and\nmagnetoelastic effects. Our case study is the apparently frustrated magnetism\nof the Mn$_3$A class of materials in all its cubic, hexagonal, and tetragonal\nstructures.

The frequency is only increased again two milliseconds after\nthe last code section containing such instructions has been executed in order\nto prevent excessive numbers of frequency changes. Due to this delay,\nintermittent use of wide vector operations can slow down the rest of the system\nsignificantly. For example, previous work has shown the performance of web\nservers to be reduced by up to 10% if the SSL library uses AVX-512 vector\ninstructions. These performance variations are hard to predict during software\ndevelopment as the performance impact of vectorization depends on the specific\nworkload.\n  We describe a mechanism to reduce the slowdown caused by wide vector\ninstructions without requiring extensive changes to existing software. Our\ndesign allows the developer to mark problematic AVX code regions. The scheduler\nthen restricts execution of this code to a subset of the cores so that only\nthese cores' frequency is affected. Threads are automatically migrated to a\nsuitable core whenever necessary. We identify a suitable load balancing policy\nto ensure good utilization of all available cores.
