However, a\ncomprehensive theoretical understanding of the dynamics of such highly\nnonlinear, spatially extended systems is still missing. Here we show how a\ndescription in phase space, which has proven invaluable in shaping our\nintuition about the dynamics of nonlinear ordinary differential equations, can\nbe generalized to mass-conserving reaction-diffusion (McRD) systems. We present\na comprehensive analysis of two-component McRD systems, which serve as\nparadigmatic minimal systems that encapsulate the core principles and concepts\nof the local equilibria theory introduced in the paper. The key insight\nunderlying this theory is that shifting local (reactive) equilibria --\ncontrolled by the local total density -- give rise to concentration gradients\nthat drive diffusive redistribution of total density. We show how this dynamic\ninterplay can be embedded in the phase plane of the reaction kinetics in terms\nof simple geometric objects: the reactive nullcline and the diffusive\nflux-balance subspace. On this phase-space level, physical insight can be\ngained from geometric criteria and graphical constructions. The effects of\nnonlinearities on the global dynamics are simply encoded in the curved shape of\nthe reactive nullcline. In particular, we show that the pattern-forming `Turing\ninstability' in McRD systems is a mass-redistribution instability, and that the\nfeatures and bifurcations of patterns can be characterized based on regional\ndispersion relations, associated to distinct spatial regions (plateaus and\ninterfaces) of the patterns.

The multilayer context is much challenging as no total order exists\namong multilayer cores; rather, they form a lattice whose size is exponential\nin the number of layers. In this setting we devise three algorithms which\ndiffer in the way they visit the core lattice and in their pruning techniques.\n  We then move a step forward and study the problem of extracting the\ninner-most (also known as maximal) cores, i.e., the cores that are not\ndominated by any other core in terms of their core index in all the layers.\nInner-most cores are typically orders of magnitude less than all the cores.\nMotivated by this, we devise an algorithm that effectively exploits the\nmaximality property and extracts inner-most cores directly, without first\ncomputing a complete decomposition.\n  Finally, we showcase the multilayer core-decomposition tool in a variety of\nscenarios and problems.

In practice, we are often\ninterested in signals with 'simple' Fourier structure, such as bandlimited,\nmultiband, and Fourier sparse signals. More broadly, any prior knowledge about\na signal's Fourier power spectrum can constrain its complexity. Intuitively,\nsignals with more highly constrained Fourier structure require fewer samples to\nreconstruct.\n  We formalize this intuition by showing that, roughly, a continuous signal\nfrom a given class can be approximately reconstructed using a number of samples\nproportional to the *statistical dimension* of the allowed power spectrum of\nthat class. Further, in nearly all settings, this natural measure tightly\ncharacterizes the sample complexity of signal reconstruction.\n  Surprisingly, we also show that, up to logarithmic factors, a universal\nnon-uniform sampling strategy can achieve this optimal complexity for *any\nclass of signals*. We present a simple and efficient algorithm for recovering a\nsignal from the samples taken. For bandlimited and sparse signals, our method\nmatches the state-of-the-art. At the same time, it gives the first\ncomputationally and sample efficient solution to a broad range of problems,\nincluding multiband signal reconstruction and kriging and Gaussian process\nregression tasks in one dimension.\n  Our work is based on a novel connection between randomized linear algebra and\nsignal reconstruction with constrained Fourier structure. We extend tools based\non statistical leverage score sampling and column-based matrix reconstruction\nto the approximation of continuous linear operators that arise in signal\nreconstruction. We believe that these extensions are of independent interest\nand serve as a foundation for tackling a broad range of continuous time\nproblems using randomized methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Dec 2018 17:51:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-24"}

Our proofs use new tools for upper\nbounding the asymptotic slice rank of a wide range of tensors. Our main result\nis that the Universal method applied to any Coppersmith-Winograd tensor $CW_q$\ncannot yield a bound on $\\omega$, the exponent of matrix multiplication, better\nthan $2.16805$.

The quintessence perturbations cause their\ngrowth to depend on scale. We perform the first separate universe simulations\nfor this cosmology. We demonstrate that the power spectrum response and the\nhalo bias depend on scale and initial conditions and that the presence of the\nisocurvature mode changes the mapping from these quantities to the halo auto-\nand cross-power spectra, and the squeezed-limit bispectrum. We compare the bias\nto several models, finding reasonable agreement with both a\npower-spectrum-response model with one free parameter and a model that fits two\nindependent bias parameters for curvature and isocurvature sourced\nfluctuations.

In scenarios where the dark matter\ninteracts with the Standard Model via a new physics mediator, the early\nUniverse dynamics of the dark sector can be particularly complex, as the dark\nmatter and the mediator could be in thermal and chemical equilibrium with each\nother. This equilibration takes place via number-changing processes such as\ndouble Compton scattering and bremsstrahlung, whose amplitudes are cumbersome\nto calculate.

Moreover, the\nentanglement of quantum systems is hard to preserve for a long time period due\nto decoherence and dephasing mainly caused by radiative and nonradiative\nlosses. In this work, we outperform the aforementioned limitations by\npresenting efficient long-range inter-emitter entanglement and large\nenhancement of resonance energy transfer between two optical qubits mediated by\nepsilon-near-zero (ENZ) and other plasmonic waveguide types, such as V-shaped\ngrooves and cylindrical nanorods. More importantly, we explicitly demonstrate\nthat the ENZ waveguide resonant energy transfer and entanglement performance\ndrastically outperforms the other waveguide systems. Only the excited ENZ mode\nhas an infinite phase velocity combined with a strong and homogeneous electric\nfield distribution, which leads to a giant energy transfer and efficient\nentanglement independent to the emitters separation distances and nanoscale\npositions in the ENZ nanowaveguide, an advantageous feature that can\npotentially accommodate multi-qubit entanglement. Moreover, the transient\nentanglement can be further improved and become almost independent of the\ndetrimental decoherence effect when an optically active (gain) medium is\nembedded inside the ENZ waveguide.

One fundamental problem of such systems is\nhow to increase the transmission rate. Two new schemes are proposed to address\nthe limited data rate issue: adaptive transmission scheme and generalized data\nrepresentation (GDR) scheme. In the first scheme, an adaptive transmission is\ndesigned to select the transmission vectors for maximizing the data rate under\ndifferent channel conditions. The block error rate (BLER) of the first scheme\nis 80% lower than that of the conventional one-hot vector scheme. This implies\nthat higher data rate can be achieved by the adaptive transmission scheme. In\nthe second scheme, the GDR replaces the conventional one-hot representation.\nThe GDR scheme can achieve higher data rate than the conventional one-hot\nvector scheme with comparable BLER performance. For example, when the vector\nsize is eight, the proposed GDR scheme can double the date rate of the one-hot\nvector scheme. Besides, the joint scheme of the two proposed schemes can create\nfurther benefits. The effect of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is analyzed for\nthese DL-based communication systems. Numerical results show that training the\nautoencoder using data set with various SNR values can attain robust BLER\nperformance under different channel conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Dec 2018 22:19:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2020 02:59:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-30"}

In\nnew environments such as voice-based search with smart home devices, however,\nfeedback about result quality can potentially be obtained during users'\ninteractions with the system. Since there are severe limitations on the length\nand number of results that can be presented in a single interaction in this\nenvironment, the focus should move from browsing result lists to iterative\nretrieval and from retrieving documents to retrieving answers. In this paper,\nwe study iterative relevance feedback techniques with a focus on retrieving\nanswer passages.

The location of the primary contributing ground sources\nof noise was found by consideration of the propagation paths of radar\nbackscatter from the ground. The elevation angle for the ground echoes was\ndetermined through a new empirical model. It was used to determine the paths of\nthe noise and the location of its source. The method was particularly well\nsuited for daytime situations which had to be limited for the most part to only\ntwo crossings through the D region.

In particular, we focus\non the strong spatial correlation regimes where the covariance matrix of each\nuser channel vector has a rank that scales sublinearly with the number of base\nstation antennas, as the latter grows to infinity. We also consider the case\nwhere the covariance eigenvectors corresponding to the non-zero eigenvalues\nspan randomly selected subspaces. For this channel model, referred to as the\n\"random sparse angular support\" model, we characterize the asymptotic capacity\nscaling law in the limit of large number of antennas. To achieve the asymptotic\ncapacity results, statistical spatial despreading based on the second-order\nchannel statistics plays a pivotal role in terms of pilot decontamination and\ninterference suppression. A remarkable result is that even when the number of\nusers scales linearly with base station antennas, a linear growth of the\ncapacity with respect to the number of antennas is achievable under the sparse\nangular support model. We note that the achievable rate lower bound based on\nmassive MIMO \"channel hardening\", widely used in the massive MIMO literature,\nyields rather loose results in the strong spatial correlation regimes and may\nsignificantly underestimate the achievable rate of massive MIMO. This work\ntherefore considers an alternative bounding technique which is better suited to\nthe strong correlation regimes. In fading channels with sparse angular support,\nit is further shown that spatial despreading (spreading) in uplink (downlink)\nhas a more prominent impact on the performance of massive MIMO than channel\nhardening.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Dec 2018 00:04:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 Dec 2019 04:00:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-10"}

The first reason is that the\ncapture cross section of the latter reaction is larger than the one of the\n$^{34}$S+$^{208}$Pb reaction since the nucleus-nucleus potential is more\nattractive in the $^{36}$S+$^{206}$Pb reaction due to two more neutrons in\nisotope $^{36}$S. The second reason is the difference in the heights of the\nintrinsic fusion barrier $B^*_{\\rm fus}$ appearing on the fusion trajectory by\nnucleon transfer between nuclei of the DNS formed after the capture. The value\nof $B^*_{\\rm fus}$ calculated for the $^{34}$S+$^{208}$Pb reaction is higher\nthan the one obtained for the $^{36}$S+$^{206}$Pb reaction. This fact has been\ncaused by the difference between the $N/Z$-ratios in the light fragments of the\nDNS formed during the capture in these reactions. The $N/Z$-ratio has been\nfound by solution of the transport master equations for the proton and neutron\ndistributions between fragments of the DNS formed at capture with the different\ninitial neutron numbers $N=18$ and $N=20$ for the reactions with the $^{34}$S\nand $^{36}$S, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Dec 2018 01:27:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

It is widely acknowledged to be integral to the process of\nhuman development as it plays a significant role in enhancing educational\noutcomes. At regional and national levels, internal migration underpins the\nefficient functioning of the economy by bringing knowledge and skills to the\nlocations where they are needed. It is the multi-dimensional nature of\nmigration that underlines its significance in the process of human development.\nHuman mobility extends in the spatial domain from local travel to international\nmigration, and in the temporal dimension from short-term stays to permanent\nrelocations. Classification and measurement of such phenomena is inevitably\ncomplex, which has severely hindered progress in comparative research, with\nvery few large-scale cross-national comparisons of migration. The linkages\nbetween migration and education have been explored in a separate line of\ninquiry that has predominantly focused on country-specific analyses as to the\nways in which migration affects educational outcomes and how educational\nattainment affects migration behaviour. A recurrent theme has been the\neducational selectivity of migrants, which in turn leads to an increase of\nhuman capital in some regions, primarily cities, at the expense of others.\nQuestions have long been raised as to the links between education and migration\nin response to educational expansion, but have not yet been fully answered\nbecause of the absence, until recently, of adequate data for comparative\nanalysis of migration. In this paper, we bring these two separate strands of\nresearch together to systematically explore links between internal migration\nand education across a global sample of 57 countries at various stages of\ndevelopment, using data drawn from the IPUMS database.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Dec 2018 02:06:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-24"}

We show that this system exhibits more than logarithmic area law\nviolation in its ground state. Strikingly this feature is found to be true even\nin the short range regime in sharp contrast to the spinless long range\ndisordered fermionic model. This necessitates the study of large systems for\nthe quantum $XY$ spin glass model which is challenging since these numerical\nmethods depend on the validity of the area law. This situation lends itself\nnaturally for the exploration of a quantum simulation approach. We present a\nproof-of-principle implementation of this non-trivially interacting spin model\nusing trapped ions and provide a detailed study of experimentally realistic\nparameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Dec 2018 04:24:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Jan 2019 11:10:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 12 Apr 2019 19:46:44 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 30 May 2019 18:51:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

Existing studies on Person Job Fit have a\nfocus on measuring the matching degree between the talent qualification and the\njob requirements mainly based on the manual inspection of human resource\nexperts despite of the subjective, incomplete, and inefficient nature of the\nhuman judgement. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel end to end\nAbility aware Person Job Fit Neural Network model, which has a goal of reducing\nthe dependence on manual labour and can provide better interpretation about the\nfitting results.

Along this line, four hierarchical ability\naware attention strategies are designed to measure the different importance of\njob requirements for semantic representation, as well as measuring the\ndifferent contribution of each job experience to a specific ability\nrequirement.

Although this is true\nfor many cases, it is unclear whether it is meaningful to ask how many state\nvariables are acceptable. This is indeed a problem when solids are investigated\nwithin the framework of thermodynamics, which is scarcely discussed in\ntextbooks. The present study gives an answer to this question: the mean values\nof all the atom positions of a given solid together with the internal energy\nconstitute a commensurate set of state variables (thermodynamic coordinates,\nTCs). The argument begins with constructing consistent definitions of\nequilibrium and TCs. TCs are created by the constraints which characterize the\nsystem under consideration. The values of TCs are uniquely determined in\nequilibrium and the mutual relationships between them constitute the\nfundamental relation of equilibrium (FRE). Specific heat can be deduced from\nthe FRE. Therefore, the TCs of a solid must be to give a full expression of the\nspecific heat in the entire range of temperature, from which the above\nconclusion is deduced. Contrary to the conventional view, an infinite number of\nthe atom positions and their microscopic characters do not conflict with the\nprinciples of thermodynamics. The most important requirement for TCs to meet is\nthe uniqueness of their values in equilibrium against random motions of the\nconstituent particles. This conclusion is compatible with the principle of\ninformation theory that the information needed to determine the probability\ndistribution of states is the expectation values of statistical variables. A\nfew working examples of TCs in solids are given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Dec 2018 07:09:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Jul 2019 01:53:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 3 Sep 2019 08:36:07 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 7 Jan 2020 09:24:37 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2020 01:39:03 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2020 05:33:43 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 2021 03:26:45 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Tue, 4 Jan 2022 01:42:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-05"}

One way to approach this problem is to first estimate\nevent-labeled gene trees (i.e., rooted trees whose non-leaf vertices are\nlabeled by speciation or gene duplication events), and to then look for a\nspecies tree which can be reconciled with this tree through a\n\\emph{reconciliation map} between the trees. In practice, however, it can\nhappen that there is no such map from a given event-labeled tree to \\emph{any}\nspecies tree. An important situation where this might arise is where the\nspecies evolution is better represented by a \\emph{network} instead of a tree.\nIn this paper, we therefore consider the problem of reconciling event-labeled\ntrees with species networks. In particular, we prove that any event-labeled\ngene tree can be reconciled with some network and that, under certain mild\nassumptions on the gene tree, the network can even be assumed to be multi-arc\nfree. To prove this result, we show that we can always reconcile the gene tree\nwith some multi-labeled (MUL-)tree, which can then be \"folded up\" to produce\nthe desired reconciliation and network. In addition, we study the interplay\nbetween reconciliation maps from event-labeled gene trees to MUL-trees and\nnetworks.

A configuration\nspecifies the amount of radio resource allocated to each group of devices for\nrandom access and for data transmission. Assuming no knowledge of the traffic\nstatistics, there exists an important challenge in \"how to determine the\nconfiguration that maximizes the long-term average number of served IoT devices\nat each Transmission Time Interval (TTI) in an online fashion\". Given the\ncomplexity of searching for optimal configuration, we first develop real-time\nconfiguration selection based on the tabular Q-learning (tabular-Q), the Linear\nApproximation based Q-learning (LA-Q), and the Deep Neural Network based\nQ-learning (DQN) in the single-parameter single-group scenario.

We found signatures of the small-scale spine and intra-spine structure\nof both the magnetic field strength and inclination at all investigated\natmospheric heights. In particular, we report typical peak-to-peak variations\nof the field strength and inclination of $\\approx 300$ G and $\\approx\n20^{\\circ}$, respectively, in the photosphere, and of $\\approx 200$ G and\n$\\approx 10^{\\circ}$ in the chromosphere. Besides, we estimated the vertical\ngradient of the magnetic field strength in the studied penumbra: we find a\nvalue of $\\approx 0.3$ G km$^{-1}$ between the photosphere and the middle\nchromosphere. Interestingly, the photospheric magnetic field gradient changes\nsign from negative in the inner to positive in the outer penumbra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Dec 2018 10:19:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-20"}

Results: In general,\nuser interfaces of Android apps are perceived more ugly than beautiful. Yet,\nraters only moderately agree on the visual aesthetics.

This paper proposes a novel method for autonomously detecting\ncasualties lying on the ground using obtained 3D point-cloud data from an\non-board sensor, such as an RGB-D camera or a 3D LIDAR, on a mobile rescue\nrobot. In this method, the obtained 3D point-cloud data is projected onto the\ndetected ground plane, i.e. floor, within the point cloud. Then, this projected\npoint cloud is converted into a grid-map that is used afterwards as an input\nfor the algorithm to detect human body shapes. The proposed method is evaluated\nby performing detection of a human dummy, placed in different random positions\nand orientations, using an on-board RGB-D camera on a mobile rescue robot\ncalled ResQbot. To evaluate the robustness of the casualty detection method to\ndifferent camera angles, the orientation of the camera is set to different\nangles.

The DGSEM is constructed with a local\ntensor-product Lagrange-polynomial basis computed from Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto\n(LGL) points. Furthermore, the collocation of interpolation and quadrature\nnodes is used in the spatial discretization. This approach leads to discrete\nderivative approximations in space that are summation-by-parts (SBP) operators.\nOn a static mesh, the SBP property and suitable two-point flux functions, which\nsatisfy the entropy condition from Tadmor, allow to mimic results from the\ncontinuous entropy analysis on the discrete level. In this paper, Tadmor's\ncondition is extended to the moving mesh framework. Based on the moving mesh\nentropy condition, entropy conservative two-point flux functions for the\nhomogeneous shallow water equations and the compressible Euler equations are\nconstructed. Furthermore, it will be proven that the semi-discrete moving mesh\nDGSEM is an entropy conservative scheme when a two-point flux function, which\nsatisfies the moving mesh entropy condition, is applied in the split form DG\nframework. This proof does not require any exactness of quadrature in the\nspatial integrals of the variational form. Nevertheless, entropy conservation\nis not sufficient to tame discontinuities in the numerical solution and thus\nthe entropy conservative moving mesh DGSEM is modified by adding numerical\ndissipation matrices to the entropy conservative fluxes. Then, the method\nbecomes entropy stable such that the discrete mathematical entropy is bounded\nat any time by its initial and boundary data when the boundary conditions are\nspecified appropriately. The theoretical properties of the moving mesh DGSEM\nwill be validated by numerical experiments for the compressible Euler\nequations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Dec 2018 12:54:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-24"}

In this context, the\nquestion that arises is which software process self-assessment methods exist\nand which kind of support they provide? To answer this question, a mapping\nstudy on software process self-assessment methods was performed. As result, a\ntotal of 33 methods were identified and analyzed, synthesizing information on\ntheir measurement framework, process reference model and assessment process. We\nobserved that most self-assessment methods are based on consolidated models,\nsuch as CMMI or ISO/IEC 15504 with a trend to develop self-assessment methods\nspecifically for SMEs. In general, they use simplified assessment processes,\nfocusing on data collection and analysis. Most of the methods propose to\ncollect data through questionnaires that are answered by managers or other team\nmembers related to the process being assessed.

The results of our study\nmay help practitioners, interested in conducting software process\nself-assessments, to choose a self-assessment method.

Model-based optimization methods are\nflexible for handling different inverse problems but are usually\ntime-consuming. In contrast, deep learning methods have fast testing speed but\nthe performance of these CNNs is still inferior. To address this issue, here we\npropose a novel deep residual learning model that combines the dilated residual\nconvolution and multi-scale convolution groups. Due to the complex patterns and\nstructures of inside an image, the multiscale convolution group is utilized to\nlearn those patterns and enlarge the receptive field.

It is also shown that\nnon-Hermiticity enables a Hermitian-conjugate counterpart of the\nAltland-Zirnbauer symmetry. Taking into account sublattice symmetry or\npseudo-Hermiticity as an additional symmetry, the total number of symmetry\nclasses is 38 instead of 10, which describe intrinsic non-Hermitian topological\nphases as well as non-Hermitian random matrices. Furthermore, due to the\ncomplex nature of energy spectra, non-Hermitian systems feature two different\ntypes of complex-energy gaps, point-like and line-like vacant regions. On the\nbasis of these concepts and K-theory, we complete classification of\nnon-Hermitian topological phases in arbitrary dimensions and symmetry classes.\nRemarkably, non-Hermitian topology depends on the type of complex-energy gaps\nand multiple topological structures appear for each symmetry class and each\nspatial dimension, which are also illustrated in detail with concrete examples.\nMoreover, the bulk-boundary correspondence in non-Hermitian systems is\nelucidated within our framework, and symmetries preventing the non-Hermitian\nskin effect are identified.

Compared\nto inversion on the original model space, using the latent space of a trained\nGAN can offer the following benefits: (1) the generated model proposals are\ngeostatistically consistent with the prescribed prior training image (TI), and\n(2) the parameter space is reduced by orders of magnitude compared to the\noriginal model space.

As an alternative, parameters in this latent space\ncould possibly be optimized with much less computationally expensive\ngradient-based methods. We show that due to the typically highly nonlinear\nrelationship between the latent space and the associated output space of a GAN,\ngradient-based deterministic inversion may fail even when considering a linear\nforward physical model. We tested two deterministic inversion approaches: a\nquasi-Newton gradient descent using the Adam algorithm and a Gauss-Newton (GN)\nmethod that makes use of the Jacobian matrix calculated by finite-differencing.\nFor a channelized binary TI and a synthetic linear crosshole ground penetrating\nradar (GPR) tomography problem involving 576 measurements with low noise, we\nobserve that when allowing for a total of 10,000 iterations only 13% of the\ngradient descent trials locate a solution that has the required data misfit.\nThe tested GN inversion was unable to recover a solution with the appropriate\ndata misfit. Our results suggest that deterministic inversion performance\nstrongly depends on the inversion approach, starting model, true reference\nmodel, number of iterations and noise realization. In contrast,\ncomputationally-expensive probabilistic global optimization always finds an\nappropriate solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Dec 2018 14:22:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Jan 2019 23:09:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 22 May 2019 14:14:36 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 23 May 2019 09:09:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-29"}

Risk awareness is in our framework\ncaptured by objective functions in which the risk neutral expectation is\nreplaced by a risk function, a nonlinear functional of random variables that\naccount for the controller's risk preferences. We state and prove a risk aware\nminimum principle that is a parsimonious generalization of the well-known risk\nneutral, stochastic Pontryagin's minimum principle. As our main results we give\nnecessary and also sufficient conditions for optimality of control processes\ntaking values on probability measures defined on a given action space. We show\nthat remarkably, going from the risk neutral to the risk aware case, the\nminimum principle is simply modified by the introduction of one additional\nreal-valued stochastic process that acts as a risk adjustment factor for given\ncost rate and terminal cost functions. This adjustment process is explicitly\ngiven as the expectation, conditional on the filtration at the given time, of\nan appropriately defined functional derivative of the risk function evaluated\nat the random total cost.

To take advantage of this silicon-compatible\nferroelectric, fundamental questions such as the origin of ferroelectricity and\nbetter approach to controlled realization of ferroelectricity at the nanoscale\nneed to be addressed. The emergence of robust polarization in HfO$_2$-based\nthin films is considered as the cumulative effect of various extrinsic factors\nsuch as finite-size effects and surface/interface effects of small grains,\ncompressive stress, dopants, oxygen vacancies, and electric fields. The kinetic\neffects of phase transitions and their potential impacts on the emergence of\nferroelectricity in HfO$_2$ at the nanoscale are not well understood. In this\nwork, we construct the transition paths between different polymorphs of hafnia\nwith density functional theory calculations and variable-cell nudged elastic\nband technique. We find that the transition barriers depend strongly on the\nmechanical boundary conditions and the transition from the tetragonal phase to\nthe polar orthorhombic phase is a fast process kinetically under clamping. The\neffects of growth orientations and epitaxial strains on the relative stability\nof different phases of HfO$_2$ are investigated. The two orthorhombic phases,\npolar $Pca2_1$ and non-polar $Pbca$, become thermodynamically stable in\n(111)-oriented thin films over a wide range of epitaxial strain conditions.\nThis work suggests a potential avenue to better stabilize the ferroelectric\nphase in HfO$_2$ thin films through substrate orientation engineering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Dec 2018 15:09:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 11 May 2019 13:33:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-22"}

To leading order in chiral perturbation theory the results depend\non only two experimentally known low-energy constants and the\nnucleon-pion-state contribution to the form factors can be estimated. The\nnucleon-pion-state contribution to the axial form factor $G_{\\rm A}(Q^2)$ is at\nthe 5 percent level for a source-sink separation of 2 fm and shows almost no\ndependence on the momentum transfer $Q^2$.

Moreover, most real-world networks are time-evolving, updating their\nstructures continuously, which makes it harder to update and output newly\nmatched patterns in real time. Many incremental graph pattern matching\nalgorithms which reduce the number of updates have been proposed to handle such\ndynamic graphs.

By cleverly applying the principles of Cattaneo,\nMindlin, and Deresiewicz, Jurgen Jager developed an efficient approach for\ncomputing the full three-dimensional force between identical elastic spheres\nthat have undergone difficult movement sequences (J.

The first mechanism, already widely addressed in the DEM\nliterature, involves a contact moment between the particles. The second\nmechanism involves a reduction of the tangential contact force, but without a\ncontact moment. This type of rotational resistance, termed creep-friction, is\nthe subject of the paper. Within the creep-friction literature, the term\n\"creep\" does not mean a viscous mechanism, but rather connotes a slight slip\nthat accompanies rolling. Two extremes of particle motions bound the range of\ncreep-friction behaviors: a pure tangential translation is modeled as a\nCattaneo-Mindlin interaction, whereas prolonged steady-state rolling\ncorresponds to the traditional wheel-rail problem described by Carter,\nPoritsky, and others. DEM simulations, however, are dominated by the transient\ncreep-friction rolling conditions that lie between these two extremes. A\nsimplified model is proposed for the three-dimensional transient creep-friction\nrolling of two spheres. The model is an extension of the work of Dahlberg and\nAlfredsson, who studied the two-dimensional interactions of disks. The proposed\nmodel is applied to two different systems: a pair of spheres and a large dense\nassembly of spheres. Although creep-friction can reduce the tangential contact\nforce that would otherwise be predicted with Cattaneo-Mindlin theory, a\nsignificant force reduction occurs only when the rate of rolling is much\ngreater than the rate of translational sliding and only after a sustained\nperiod of rolling. When applied to the deviatoric loading of an assembly of\nspheres, the proposed creep-friction model has minimal effect on macroscopic\nstrength or stiffness. At the micro-scale of individual contacts,\ncreep-friction does have a modest influence on the incremental contact\nbehavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Dec 2018 02:46:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-27"}

As an example, a prevalent problem in astronomy is to estimate the\nclass of an object (e.g., Supernova Ia) using a generation of photometric\nlight-curve datasets where data abounds, but class labels are scarce; such\nanalysis can benefit from spectroscopic data where class labels are known with\nhigh confidence, but the data sample is small.

Custom\noptimization algorithms then jointly reconstruct the sample's super-resolution\nfluorescent (incoherent) and QP (coherent) distributions, while digitally\ncorrecting for system imperfections such as unknown speckle illumination\npatterns, system aberrations and pattern translations. Beyond previous linear\nSIM works, we achieve resolution gains of 4x the objective's\ndiffraction-limited native resolution, resulting in 700 nm fluorescence and 1.2\num QP resolution, across a FOV of 2x2.7 mm^2, giving a space-bandwidth product\n(SBP) of 60 megapixels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Dec 2018 06:13:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Mar 2019 16:48:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-28"}

First, the particle's medial surface (or surface skeleton),\nfrom which all candidate (maximal inscribed) spheres can be generated, is\ncomputed by the topological 3D thinning algorithm. Then, the clump generation\nprocedure is converted into a greedy set-covering problem. The advantage of\nthis approach over previous studies is that, with a given particle media\nsurface and a grid resolution for the discretized particle, a minimum number of\ncomponent (or primary) spheres for a MS particle is guaranteed for a maximum\nvolume coverage, thanks to the combined algorithm. To correct the mass\ndistribution of a MS particle due to the highly overlapped component spheres,\nlinear programming (LP) is used to adjust the density of each component sphere,\nsuch that the aggregate properties such as mass, center of mass, and inertia\ntensor are identical or close enough to the prototypical particle.
