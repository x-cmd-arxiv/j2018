In a multipolar expansion, it is known that polar perturbations of\na monopole type ($l=0$) can only increase the black-hole mass, axial\nperturbations of a dipole type ($l=1$) induce a slow rotation in the system,\nand perturbations with $l\\geq 2$ always lead to the production of gravitational\nwaves. However, in relation to the planar Schwarzschild anti--de Sitter black\nholes (or black branes, for short), there is still no conclusive study on some\naspects of the physical meaning of these perturbations. In particular, there is\nsome controversy concerning the polar sector of fluctuations with zero wave\nnumber $(k=0)$. Some authors claim that this kind of perturbations causes only\na variation in the black-brane mass parameter, while others obtained also\nevidence for the existence of gravitational waves associated to such modes. The\npresent study aims to contribute to the resolution of this controversy by\nrevealing the physical meaning of the gravitational perturbations of anti--de\nSitter black branes. In this work we use the Chandrasekhar's gauge formalism to\nevaluate the linear variations in the complex Weyl scalars in terms of the\nRegge-Wheeler-Zerilli gauge-invariant quantities. Then we use the Szekeres'\nproposal for the meaning of the Weyl scalars and the Pirani's criterion for the\nexistence of gravitational radiation in order to give a physical interpretation\nof the black-brane perturbations with arbitrary wave number value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Dec 2018 16:26:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Sep 2019 19:37:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-01"}

In particular, we consider verification of\nperfection, individual rationality, Nash stability, (contractual) individual\nstability, and core stability. While there is always a Nash-stable coalition\nstructure (which also implies individually stable coalitions), we show that the\nexistence of a perfect coalition structure is not tautological but can be\ntested.

Such low-dimensional Hubbard models are\nadvantageously studied with Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, such as Hybrid\nMonte Carlo (HMC).

Laboratory experiments on\nmicrobial range expansions have shown that this stochastic wandering,\ntransverse to the front, is superdiffusive due to the front's growing\nroughness, implying much faster loss of genetic diversity than predicted by\nsimple flat front diffusive models. We study the evolutionary consequences of\nthis superdiffusive wandering using two complementary numerical models of range\nexpansions: the stepping stone model, and a new interpretation of the model of\ndirected paths in random media, in the context of a roughening population\nfront. Through these approaches we compute statistics for the times since\ncommon ancestry for pairs of individuals with a given spatial separation at the\nfront, and we explore how environmental heterogeneities can locally suppress\nthese superdiffusive fluctuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Dec 2018 17:42:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-24"}

The question remains whether better equations\nof motion than LAD can be found to describe the dynamics of charges in the\nelectromagnetic fields. In this paper we present an approach to derive such\nequations of motions, taking as input the Maxwell equations and a particular\ncharge model only, similar to the model suggested by Dirac in his original\nderivation of LAD in 1938. We present a candidate for new equations of motion\nfor the case of a single charge. Our approach is motivated by the observation\nthat Dirac's derivation relies on an unjustified application of Stokes' theorem\nand an equally unjustified Taylor expansion of terms in his evolution\nequations. For this purpose, Dirac's calculation is repeated using an extended\ncharge model that does allow for the application of Stokes' theorem and enables\nus to find an explicit equation of motion by adapting Parrott's derivation,\nthus avoiding a Taylor expansion. The result are second order differential\ndelay equations, which describe the radiation reaction force for the charge\nmodel at hand.

The method takes two steps - estimating click\npropensities and using them to train unbiased models. Most common methods\nproposed in the literature for estimating propensities involve some degree of\nintervention in the live search engine. An alternative approach proposed\nrecently uses an Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate\npropensities by using ranking features for estimating relevances. In this work\nwe propose a novel method to directly estimate propensities which does not use\nany intervention in live search or rely on modeling relevance. Rather, we take\nadvantage of the fact that the same query-document pair may naturally change\nranks over time. This typically occurs for eCommerce search because of change\nof popularity of items over time, existence of time dependent ranking features,\nor addition or removal of items to the index (an item getting sold or a new\nitem being listed). However, our method is general and can be applied to any\nsearch engine for which the rank of the same document may naturally change over\ntime for the same query. We derive a simple likelihood function that depends on\npropensities only, and by maximizing the likelihood we are able to get\nestimates of the propensities. We apply this method to eBay search data to\nestimate click propensities for web and mobile search and compare these with\nestimates using the EM method. We also use simulated data to show that the\nmethod gives reliable estimates of the \"true\" simulated propensities. Finally,\nwe train an unbiased learning-to-rank model for eBay search using the estimated\npropensities and show that it outperforms both baselines - one without position\nbias correction and one with position bias correction using the EM method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Dec 2018 19:05:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 May 2019 22:13:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2019 17:53:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-23"}

Noise changes\nthe dynamics with respect to the deterministic model; in particular bifurcation\ntheory cannot be applied. We formulate stochastic neuronal dynamics in the\nMartin-Siggia-Rose de Dominicis-Janssen (MSRDJ) formalism and present the\nfluctuation expansion of the effective action and the functional\nrenormalization group (fRG) as two systematic ways to incorporate corrections\nto the mean dynamics and time-dependent statistics due to fluctuations in the\npresence of nonlinear neuronal gain. To formulate self-consistency equations,\nwe derive a fundamental link between the effective action in the\nOnsager-Machlup(OM) formalism, which allows the study of phase transitions, and\nthe MSRDJ effective action, which is computationally advantageous. These\nresults in particular allow the derivation of an OM effective action for\nsystems with non-Gaussian noise. This approach naturally leads to effective\ndeterministic equations for the first moment of the stochastic system; they\nexplain how nonlinearities and noise cooperate to produce memory effects.\nMoreover, the MSRDJ formulation yields an effective linear system that has\nidentical power spectra and linear response.

We do so in challenging double asymptotic scenarios\nfor which this direction eventually fails to be identifiable. In order to\nachieve robustness not only with respect to such weak identifiability but also\nwith respect to heavy tails, we focus on sign-based statistical procedures,\nthat is, on procedures that involve the observations only through their\ndirection from the center of the distribution. We actually consider the generic\nproblem of testing the null hypothesis that the first principal direction\ncoincides with a given direction of $\\mathbb{R}^p$. We first focus on weak\nidentifiability setups involving single spikes (that is, involving spectra for\nwhich the smallest eigenvalue has multiplicity $p-1$).

Neither momentum\nor power losses by themselves are found to be sufficient to produce a reduction\nin target ion flux in detachment (flux rollover); radiative power losses are\nrequired to a) limit and reduce the ionization source and b) access low-target\ntemperature, T_target, conditions for volumetric momentum losses. Recombination\nis found to play little role at flux rollover, but as T_target drops to\ntemperatures around 1eV, it becomes a strong ion sink. In the case where\nradiative losses are dominated by hydrogen, the detachment threshold is\nidentified as a minimum gradient of the energy cost per ionisation with respect\nto T_target. This is also linked to thresholds in T_target and in the ratio of\nupstream pressure to power flux.\n  A system of determining the detached condition is developed such that the\ndivertor solution at a given T_target (or lack of one) is determined by the\nsimultaneous solution of two equations for target ion current - one dependent\non power losses and the other on momentum. Depending on the detailed momentum\nand power loss dependence on temperature there are regions of T_target where\nthere is no solution and the plasma 'jumps' from high to low T_target states.\nThe novel analysis methods developed here provide an intuitive way to\nunderstand complex detachment phenomena, and can potentially be used to predict\nhow changes in the seeding impurity used or recycling aspects of the divertor\ncan be utilised to modify the development of detachment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Dec 2018 22:54:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-22"}

HATS-71 is the coolest M\ndwarf star known to host a hot Jupiter. The loss of light during transits is\n4.7%, more than any other confirmed transiting planet system. The planet was\nidentified as a candidate by the ground-based HATSouth transit survey. It was\nconfirmed using ground-based photometry, spectroscopy, and imaging, as well as\nspace-based photometry from the NASA TESS mission (TIC 234523599). Combining\nall of these data, and utilizing Gaia DR2, we find that the planet has a radius\nof $1.080 \\pm 0.016 R_J$ and mass of $0.45 \\pm 0.24 M_J$ (95% confidence upper\nlimit of $0.81 M_J$ ), while the star has a mass of $0.569\n\\pm^{0.042}_{0.069}\\,M_\\odot$ and a radius of\n$0.5161\\pm^{0.0053}_{0.0099}\\,R_\\odot$.

As a result,\ndealers tend to offer a limited OTC derivatives market to highly risky\ncounterparties. Consequently, those highly risky entities rarely have access to\nhedging services precisely when they need them most. In this paper we propose a\nmethod to overcome this limitation. We propose to extend the CVA risk-neutral\nframework to compute an initial margin (IM) specific to each counterparty,\nwhich depends on the credit quality of the entity at stake, transforming the\neffective credit rating of a given netting set to AAA, regardless of the credit\nrating of the counterparty. By transforming CVA requirement into IM ones, as\nproposed in this paper, an institution could rely on the existing mechanisms\nfor posting and calling of IM, hence ensuring the operational viability of this\nnew form of managing warehoused risk. The main difference with the currently\nstandard framework is the creation of a Specific Initial Margin, that depends\nin the credit rating of the counterparty and the characteristics of the netting\nset in question. In this paper we propose a methodology for such transformation\nin a sound manner, and hence this method overcomes some of the limitations of\nthe CVA framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Dec 2018 23:14:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-27"}

These evaluations restrict\ngeneralizability since the results are: non-comparable to other password\nsystems (e.g. PINs), harder to reproduce, and attacker-dependent. Strong\nstatements about the security of a password system use an analysis of the\nstatistical distribution of the password space, which models a best-case\nattacker who guesses passwords in order of most likely to least likely.\n  Estimating the distribution of recognition passwords is challenging because\nmany different trials need to map to one password.

The surrogate is\ntrained using limited evaluations of the forward model. Since the relationship\nbetween the time-varying inputs and outputs of the forward transport model is\ncomplex, we propose an autoregressive strategy, which treats the output at the\nprevious time step as input to the network for predicting the output at the\ncurrent time step.

We estimated the dust temperatures and\nmasses of the 260 ETGs from the ATLAS3D survey, using fits to their spectral\nenergy distributions primarily constructed from AKARI measurements. We also\nused literature measurements of the cold (CO and HI) and X-ray gas phases. Our\nETGs show no correlation between their dust and stellar masses, suggesting\ninefficient dust production by stars and/or dust destruction in X-ray gas. The\nglobal dust-to-gas mass ratios of ETGs are generally lower than those of\nlate-type galaxies, likely due to dust-poor HI envelopes in ETGs. They are also\nhigher in Virgo Cluster ETGs than in group and field ETGs, but the same ratios\nmeasured in the central parts of the galaxies only are independent of galaxy\nenvironment. Slow-rotating ETGs have systematically lower dust masses than\nfast-rotating ETGs. The dust masses and X-ray luminosities are correlated in\nfast-rotating ETGs, whose star formation rates are also correlated with the\nX-ray luminosities. The correlation between dust and X-rays in fast-rotating\nETGs appears to be caused by residual star formation, while slow-rotating ETGs\nare likely well evolved, and thus exhausting their dust. These results appear\nconsistent with the postulated evolution of ETGs, whereby fast-rotating ETGs\nform by mergers of late-type galaxies and associated bulge growth, while\nslow-rotating ETGs form by (dry) mergers of fast-rotating ETGs. Central cold\ndense gas appears to be resilient against ram pressure stripping, suggesting\nthat Virgo Cluster ETGs may not suffer strong related star formation\nsuppression.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Dec 2018 07:20:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-06"}

We discuss how such tool\ncan facilitate the process of identifying vestiges of different robots, while\nmaintaining an extensible structure aimed for future fingerprinting extensions.\nWith this contribution, we aim to raise awareness and interest of the robotics\ncommunity, robot manufacturers and robot end-users on the need of starting\nglobal actions to embrace security. We open source the tool and disclose\npreliminary results that demonstrate the current insecurity landscape in\nindustry. We argue that the robotic ecosystem is in need of generating a robot\nsecurity community, conscious about good practices and empowered by the right\ntools.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Dec 2018 09:59:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 2019 11:14:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 21 Sep 2019 06:42:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-24"}

Since all codes tend to follow the same prior, it often suffers the\nso-called \"posterior collapse\". To avoid this, this paper introduces the class\nspecific distribution for the latent code. But different from CVAE, we present\na method for disentangling the latent space into the label relevant and\nirrelevant dimensions, $\\bm{\\mathrm{z}}_s$ and $\\bm{\\mathrm{z}}_u$, for a\nsingle input.

While\n$\\bm{\\mathrm{z}}_s$ is assumed to follow the Gaussian mixture distribution in\nwhich each component corresponds to a particular class. The parameters for the\nGaussian components in $\\bm{\\mathrm{z}}_s$ encoder are optimized by the label\nsupervision in a global stochastic way.

Our contributions are twofold: Firstly,\nwe propose a class of switching signals under which a continuous-time switched\nlinear system is unstable. Our characterization of instability depends solely\non the asymptotic behaviour of frequency of switching, frequency of transition\nbetween subsystems, and fraction of activation of subsystems. Secondly, we show\nthat our class of destabilizing switching signals is a strict subset of the\nclass of switching signals that does not satisfy asymptotic characterization of\nstability recently proposed in the literature.

In this paper, we proposed an unsupervised\ndimensionality reduction algorithm termed spatial-spectral manifold\nreconstruction preserving embedding (SSMRPE) for HSI classification. At first,\na weighted mean filter (WMF) is employed to preprocess the image, which aims to\nreduce the influence of background noise. According to the spatial consistency\nproperty of HSI, the SSMRPE method utilizes a new spatial-spectral combined\ndistance (SSCD) to fuse the spatial structure and spectral information for\nselecting effective spatial-spectral neighbors of HSI pixels. Then, it explores\nthe spatial relationship between each point and its neighbors to adjusts the\nreconstruction weights for improving the efficiency of manifold reconstruction.\nAs a result, the proposed method can extract the discriminant features and\nsubsequently improve the classification performance of HSI.

Readmission within 30 days after a HF hospitalization is both a recognized\nindicator for disease progression and a source of considerable financial burden\nto the healthcare system. Consequently, the identification of patients at risk\nfor readmission is a key step in improving disease management and patient\noutcome. In this work, we used a large administrative claims dataset to\n(1)explore the systematic application of neural network-based models versus\nlogistic regression for predicting 30 days all-cause readmission after\ndischarge from a HF admission, and (2)to examine the additive value of\npatients' hospitalization timelines on prediction performance. Based on data\nfrom 272,778 (49% female) patients with a mean (SD) age of 73 years (14) and\n343,328 HF admissions (67% of total admissions), we trained and tested our\npredictive readmission models following a stratified 5-fold cross-validation\nscheme.

The long-time behaviour of solutions is largely\nunknown; statistical mechanics predicts a steady vorticity configuration, but\ndetailed numerical results in the literature contradict this theory, yielding\ninstead persistent unsteadiness. Such numerical results were obtained using\nartificial hyperviscosity to account for the cascade of enstrophy into smaller\nscales. Hyperviscosity, however, destroys the underlying geometry of the phase\nflow (such as conservation of Casimir functions), and therefore might affect\nthe qualitative long-time behaviour. Here we develop an efficient numerical\nmethod for long-time simulations that preserve the geometric features of the\nexact flow, in particular conservation of Casimirs. Long-time simulations on a\nnon-rotating sphere then reveal three possible outcomes for generic initial\nconditions: the formation of either 2, 3, or 4 coherent vortex structures.\nThese numerical results contradict the statistical mechanics theory and show\nthat previous numerical results, suggesting 4 coherent vortex structures as the\ngeneric behaviour, display only a special case.

In this circumstance a shear wave is excited and\nsuperimposed on the sound wave. The turbulent shear stress is modulated by the\nshear wave and the wall shear stress is strongly affected by the turbulence.\nFrom the experimental point of view, it results in a measured damping strictly\nconnected to the ratio between the thickness of the acoustic sublayer, which is\nfrequency dependent, and the thickness of the viscous sublayer of the turbulent\nmean flow, the last one being dependent on the Mach number. By reducing the\nturbulence, the viscous sublayer thickness increases and the wave propagation\nis mainly dominated by convective effects. In the present work, the damping and\nwall impedance have been extracted from the measured complex wavenumber, which\nrepresents the most important parameter used to characterize the wave\npropagation. An experimental approach, referred to as iterative plane wave\ndecomposition, has been used in order to obtain the results.

The\nelectron distribution function provided by this modification exhibits some very\ndesirable properties when compared to the full Fokker- Planck operator in the\nlocal diffusive regime, and also performs very well when benchmarked against\nVlasov-Fokker-Planck and collisional PIC codes in the nonlocal transport\nregime, where we find that the effect of the electric field via the nonlocal\nOhms law is an essential ingredient in order to capture the electron kinetics\nproperly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Dec 2018 05:36:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-01"}

LEACH is one of\nthese protocols which is a hierarchical routing protocol and helps in saving\nenergy in wireless sensor networks. Enhanced LEACH depends on a mathematical\nmodel to calculate the estimated average energy in each round. consequently,\nutilizing the node remaining energy to ensure rotating cluster head role over\nall the nodes. It also depends on a mathematical model to calculate base\nstation distance from work field whereas LEACH does not take into its account\nany consideration for remaining energy of node. In this paper, we enhance LEACH\n(work efficiency in homogeneous networks) to adapt with base-station distance,\nthus more energy saving for certain distances from base-station. The obtained\nsimulation results show that enhanced LEACH saves energy better than LEACH and\nincrease network stability and reliability when base-station is inside working\nfield and consume the same energy as LEACH when base-station is outside work\nfield.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Dec 2018 22:40:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-04"}

The transistors, which are\nfabricated from a monolayer of MoS2 with a room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL)\nin place of a conventional oxide gate dielectric, exhibit very low intrinsic\nnoise resulting in a pH limit of detection (LOD) of 92x10^-6 at 10 Hz. This\nhigh device performance, which is a function of the structure of our device, is\nachieved by remotely connecting the gate to a pH sensing element allowing the\nFETs to be reused. Because pH measurements are fundamentally important in\nbiotechnology, the low limit of detection demonstrated here will benefit\nnumerous applications ranging from pharmaceutical manufacturing to clinical\ndiagnostics. As an example, we experimentally quantified the function of the\nkinase Cdk5, an enzyme implicated in Alzheimer's disease, at concentrations\nthat are 5-fold lower than physiological values, and with sufficient\ntime-resolution to allow the estimation of both steady-state and kinetic\nparameters in a single experiment. The high sensitivity, low LOD and fast\nturnaround time of the measurements will allow the development of early\ndiagnostic tools and novel therapeutics to detect and treat neurological\nconditions years before currently possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Dec 2018 16:34:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-08"}

The results of the comparative\nexperiments in solving SAT problem have proved that the new hierarchical\ngenetic algorithm based on simulated annealing and optimal individuals (BEA)\ncan improve the success rate and convergence speed considerably for SAT problem\ndue to its avoidance of both divergence and loss of optimal individuals, and by\ncoronary, conducive to NP problem.
