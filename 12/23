We propose a fully unsupervised learning algorithm that alternates\nbetween solving two sub-problems: (i) learn a phoneme classifier for a given\nset of phoneme segmentation boundaries, and (ii) refining the phoneme\nboundaries based on a given classifier. To solve the first sub-problem, we\nintroduce a novel unsupervised cost function named Segmental Empirical Output\nDistribution Matching, which generalizes the work in (Liu et al., 2017) to\nsegmental structures. For the second sub-problem, we develop an approximate MAP\napproach to refining the boundaries obtained from Wang et al. (2017).\nExperimental results on TIMIT dataset demonstrate the success of this fully\nunsupervised phoneme recognition system, which achieves a phone error rate\n(PER) of 41.6%. Although it is still far away from the state-of-the-art\nsupervised systems, we show that with oracle boundaries and matching language\nmodel, the PER could be improved to 32.5%.This performance approaches the\nsupervised system of the same model architecture, demonstrating the great\npotential of the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Dec 2018 01:58:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-27"}

Existing pattern-based methods\nextract hypernym-hyponym term pairs and then organize these pairs into a\ntaxonomy. However, by considering each term as an independent concept node,\nthey overlook the topical proximity and the semantic correlations among terms.\nIn this paper, we propose a method for constructing topic taxonomies, wherein\nevery node represents a conceptual topic and is defined as a cluster of\nsemantically coherent concept terms. Our method, TaxoGen, uses term embeddings\nand hierarchical clustering to construct a topic taxonomy in a recursive\nfashion. To ensure the quality of the recursive process, it consists of: (1) an\nadaptive spherical clustering module for allocating terms to proper levels when\nsplitting a coarse topic into fine-grained ones; (2) a local embedding module\nfor learning term embeddings that maintain strong discriminative power at\ndifferent levels of the taxonomy.

During 30 days of operation, an\ninitial microalgae mixed consortia dominated by the green microalgae\nScenedesmus sp. was cultivated in two different photo-sequencing batch reactors\noperated at hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 6 days (PSBR6) and 4 days (PSBR4)\nat a theoretical solids retention time (SRT) of 10 d. Both reactors were\ncompared with a semi-continuous reactor (SC10) operated at 10 d of HRT and 10\ndays of SRT (used as a control). The results indicated that PSBR6 and PSBR4\ndecreased Scenedesmus sp. population by 88% and 48%, respectively. However,\nonly PSBR6 provided suitable conditions to select cyanobacteria from an initial\ngreen algae dominated culture. These conditions included volumetric loads of\n11.72 mg TN L-1d-1, 2.04 mg TP L-1d-1 and 53.31 mg TOC L-1d-1. The remaining\nnutrients in the culture led also to a phosphorus limiting N:P ratio (34:1)\nthat improved the increase of cyanobacteria from an initial 2% until 70% of the\ntotal population. In addition, PSBR6 reached a biomass production of 0.12 g\nL-1d-1, while removing TN, TP and TOC by 58%, 83% and 85%, respectively.\nConversely, the application of higher nutrients loads caused by lower HRT\n(PSBR4) led to an increase of only 13% of cyanobacteria while SC10 remained\nwith the same biomass composition during all the experimental time. Thus, this\nstudy showed that the dominance of cyanobacteria in microalgal based wastewater\ntreatment systems can be controlled by the operational and nutritional\nconditions.

However, most of\nthe work in this area has dealt with videos acquired by fixed cameras with\nwider field of view. Recently, widespread use of wearable cameras and recording\ndevices such as cellphones have opened the door to interesting research in\nfirst-person Point-of-view (POV) videos (egocentric videos). Nonetheless,\nanalysis of such videos is challenging due to factors such as poor video\nquality due to ego-motion, blurriness, severe changes in lighting conditions\nand perspective distortions. To facilitate the research towards conquering\nthese challenges, this paper contributes a new dataset called EgoReID. The\ndataset is captured using 3 mobile cellphones with non-overlapping\nfield-of-view. It contains 900 IDs and around 10,200 tracks with a total of\n176,000 detections. The dataset also contains 12-sensor meta data e.g. camera\norientation pitch and rotation for each video.\n  In addition, we propose a new framework which takes advantage of both visual\nand sensor meta data to successfully perform Person ReID. We extend image-based\nre-ID method employing human body parsing trained on ten datasets to\nvideo-based re-ID. In our method, first frame level local features are\nextracted for each semantic region, then 3D convolutions are applied to encode\nthe temporal information in each sequence of semantic regions. Additionally, we\nemploy sensor meta data to predict targets' next camera and their estimated\ntime of arrival, which considerably improves our ReID performance as it\nsignificantly reduces our search space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Dec 2018 17:32:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 May 2019 10:46:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 7 Aug 2019 03:36:28 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2019 21:28:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-10"}

Indeed, some suggest that low-cost, high-density biological\nsystems may help to mitigate the rising demand for computational power and the\n\"end\" of Moore's law of exponential growth in the density of transistors.\n  In this chapter we address widespread misconceptions about thermodynamics and\nthe thermodynamics of computation. In particular, we will argue against the\ngeneral perception that a measurement or copy operation can be performed at no\ncost, against the emphasis placed on the significance of erasure operations,\nand against the careless discussion of heat and work. While not universal,\nthese misconceptions are sufficiently prevalent (particularly within\ninterdisciplinary contexts) to warrant a detailed discussion.

These methods rely on multiple samples from the population,\nalong with the information of which individuals appear in which samples. The\ngoal of record linkage techniques is to identify unique individuals across\nsamples based on the information collected on them. Linkage decisions are\nsubject to uncertainty when such information contains errors and missingness,\nand when different individuals have very similar characteristics. Uncertainty\nin the linkage should be propagated into the stage of population size\nestimation. We propose an approach called linkage-averaging to propagate\nlinkage uncertainty, as quantified by some Bayesian record linkage\nmethodologies, into a subsequent stage of population size estimation.\nLinkage-averaging is a two-stage approach in which the results from the record\nlinkage stage are fed into the population size estimation stage. We show that\nunder some conditions the results of this approach correspond to those of a\nproper Bayesian joint model for both record linkage and population size\nestimation. The two-stage nature of linkage-averaging allows us to combine\ndifferent record linkage models with different capture-recapture models, which\nfacilitates model exploration. We present a case study from the Salvadoran\ncivil war, where we are interested in estimating the total number of civilian\nkillings using lists of witnesses' reports collected by different\norganizations.

Here, we\nperform a systematic investigation of transverse spin excitations of $3d$ and\n$4d$ single impurities embedded in two prototypical topological insulators\n(Bi$_2$Te$_3$ and Bi$_2$Se$_3$). The impurity-induced states within the bulk\ngap of the topological insulators are found to have a drastic impact on the\nspin excitation spectra, resulting in very high lifetimes reaching up to\n${microseconds}$. An intuitive picture of the spin dynamics is obtained by\nmapping onto a generalized Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert phenomenological model. The\nfirst quantity extracted from this mapping procedure is the magnetic anisotropy\nenergy, which is then compared to the one provided by the magnetic force\ntheorem. This uncovers some difficulties encountered with the latter, which can\nprovide erroneous results for impurities with a high density of states at the\nFermi energy. Moreover, the Gilbert damping and nutation tensors are obtained.\nThe nutation effects can lead to a non-negligible shift in the spin excitation\nresonance in the high-frequency regime.

These include neuronal avalanches satisfying\nthe power scaling law and thereby exemplifying self-organized criticality in\nliving systems. A crucial question is how these patterns can be explained and\nmodeled in a way that is biologically meaningful, mathematically tractable and\nyet broad enough to account for neuronal heterogeneity and complexity. Here we\npropose a simple model which may offer an answer to this question. Our\nderivations are based on just few phenomenological observations concerning\ninput-output behavior of an isolated neuron. A distinctive feature of the model\nis that at the simplest level of description it comprises of only two\nvariables, a network activity variable and an exogenous variable corresponding\nto energy needed to sustain the activity and modulate the efficacy of signal\ntransmission. Strikingly, this simple model is already capable of explaining\nemergence of network spikes and bursts in developing neuronal cultures. The\nmodel behavior and predictions are supported by empirical observations and\npublished experimental evidence on cultured neurons behavior exposed to oxygen\nand energy deprivation. At the larger, network scale, introduction of the\nenergy-dependent regulatory mechanism enables the network to balance on the\nedge of the network percolation transition. Network activity in this state\nshows population bursts satisfying the scaling avalanche conditions. This\nnetwork state is self-sustainable and represents a balance between global\nnetwork-wide processes and spontaneous activity of individual elements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Dec 2018 22:04:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-17"}

This study presents a\nfirst step in solving the standing issue of accurately knowing the dosimeter\nposition at all time during in vivo dosimetry. In this work, an energy\nindependent dosimeter, namely plastic scintillation detector, is coupled to an\nelectromagnetic (EM) sensor having sub-mm positional accuracy for real-time\ntracking of the dosimeter position. However, adding an EM sensor adds materials\nin the path to the scintillator and thus could potentially perturb the dose\nmeasurements.To confirm the perturbation presence, 4 different sensors were\nplaced in front of the scintillator so the radiation does not arrive to it\ndirectly. Variation of the distance between the sensor and the scintillator was\nused to quantify the effect on the signal at 0{\\deg} and 90{\\deg}.To test the\ndependence for each sensor, the signal measurement were taken from 0{\\deg} to\n90{\\deg} with 10${\\deg}$ increment. The 5PCBDOF sensor showed an increased\nsignal of almost $20{\\%}$ with increasing beam angle. Sensor 5DOF, 5DOFthin and\n6DOFshowed no significant angle dependance.The 6DOF and 5DOFthin sensor's cable\nrevealed no extra signal attenuation. The latter gives a smaller overall\nattenuation. Therefore, the 5DOFthin is chosen to be part of the novel\ndosimeter construction. It has a jitter error of $\\pm$ 0.06 mm and a\nreproductibility of$ {\\pm}$ 0.008 mm. In the optimal operating range, the\naverage positional uncertainty is less than 0.2 mm. Average angle errors are at\nmost of 1.1${\\deg}$. It is feasible to integrate an EM tracking sensor to an\nenergy independent plastic scintillation dosimeter with minimal impact to the\ncollected signal as well as sufficient positional accuracy to keep dose\nuncertainty below 5${\\%}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Dec 2018 22:04:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-27"}

This approach, more generally, permits us to define a large class\nof so-called anharmonic oscillators by employing positive Rockland operators on\n$\\mathbf{H}_{n, 2}$. By using the methods developed in ter Elst and Robinson\n[tERo], we obtain spectral estimates for the harmonic and anharmonic\noscillators on $\\mathbf{H}_n$. Moreover, we show that our approach extends to\ngraded $SI/Z$-groups of central dimension $1$, i.e., graded groups which\npossess unitary irreducible representations which are square-integrable modulo\nthe $1$-dimensional center $Z(G)$. The latter part of the article is concerned\nwith spectral multipliers. By combining ter Elst and Robinson's techniques with\nrecent results in [AkRu18], we obtain useful\n$L^\\mathbf{p}$-$L^\\mathbf{q}$-estimates for spectral multipliers of the\nsub-Laplacian $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathbf{H}_{n, 2}}$ and, in fact more generally, of\ngeneral Rockland operators on general graded groups. As a by-product, we\nrecover the Sobolev embeddings on graded groups established in [FiRu17], and\nobtain explicit hypoelliptic heat semigroup estimates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Dec 2018 23:04:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-27"}

VAEs maximize\na lower bound on the log marginal likelihood, which implies that they will in\nprinciple overfit the training data when provided with a sufficiently\nexpressive decoder. In the limit of an infinite capacity decoder, the optimal\ngenerative model is a uniform mixture over the training data. More generally,\nan optimal decoder should output a weighted average over the examples in the\ntraining data, where the magnitude of the weights is determined by the\nproximity in the latent space.

It is found by applying\nFine's theorem that the CGLMP approach involves a LHVT for the joint\nprobabilities associated with the measurement of one observable from each of\nthe two sub-systems, even though the underlying probabilities for joint\nmeasurements of all four observables may involve a non-local HVT. The latter\nHVT probabilities involve simultaneous measurements of observables\ncorresponding to non-commuting quantum operators - allowable in classical\ntheory. Although the CGLMP inequalities involve probabilities for measurements\nof one observable per sub-system and are compatible with the Heisenberg\nuncertainty principle, there is no unambiguous quantum measurement process\nlinked to the probabilities in the CGLMP inequalities, and these quantum\nmeasurements each have different probabilities. However, violation of a CGLMP\ninequality based on any one of the possible quantum measurement sequences is\nsufficient to show that the Collins et al LHVT predicts different results to\nquantum theory. This occurs for a state considered in their paper - though for\nobservables whose physical interpretation is unclear.

We begin with an investigation of the\nclassical notion of strong local observability of nonlinear systems and its\nrelationship to optimization-based state estimation. We then present a general\nmoving-horizon estimation framework for strongly locally observable systems, as\nan iterative minimization scheme in the space of probability measures. This\nframework allows for the minimization of the estimation cost with respect to\ndifferent metrics. In particular, we consider two variants, which we name\n$W_2$-MHE and KL-MHE, where the minimization scheme uses the 2-Wasserstein\ndistance and the KL-divergence, respectively. The $W_2$-MHE yields a\ngradient-based estimator whereas the KL-MHE yields a particle filter, for which\nwe investigate asymptotic stability and robustness properties. Stability\nresults for these moving-horizon estimators are derived in the probabilistic\nsetting, against the backdrop of the classical notion of strong local\nobservability which, to the best of our knowledge, differentiates it from other\nprevious works. We then propose a mechanism to encode differential privacy of\nthe measurements used by the estimator via an entropy regularization of the MHE\nobjective functional. In particular, we find sufficient bounds on the\nregularization parameter to achieve the desired level of differential privacy.\nNumerical simulations demonstrate the performance of these estimators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Dec 2018 08:44:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Jan 2019 21:37:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 2019 23:55:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-20"}

Here a key challenge is to\nimplement and combine low power consumption, high operation speed, reliable\nreversibility and compatibility with semiconductor technology. Hybrid\nstructures based on the assembly of ferromagnetic and semiconducting building\nblocks are attractive candidates in that respect as such systems bring together\nthe properties of the isolated constituents: They are expected to show magnetic\norder as a ferromagnet and to be electrically tunable as a semiconductor. Here\nwe demonstrate the electrical control of the exchange coupling in a hybrid\nconsisting of a ferromagnetic Co layer and a semiconductor CdTe quantum well,\nseparated by a thin non-magnetic (Cd,Mg)Te barrier. The effective magnetic\nfield of the exchange interaction reaches up to 2.5 Tesla and can be turned on\nand off by application of 1 V bias across the heterostructure. The mechanism of\nthis electric field control is essentially different from the conventional\nconcept, in which wavefunctions are spatially redistributed to vary the\nexchange interaction, requiring high field strengths. Here we address instead\ncontrol of the novel exchange mechanism that is mediated by elliptically\npolarized phonons emitted from the ferromagnet, i.e. the phononic ac Stark\neffect. An essential parameter of this coupling is the splitting between heavy\nand light hole states in the quantum well which can be varied by the electric\nfield induced band bending. Thereby the splitting can be tuned with respect to\nthe magnon-phonon resonance energy in the ferromagnet, leading to maximum\ncoupling for flat band conditions. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of\nelectrically controlled exchange coupling in hybrid semiconductor\nnanostructures at quite moderate electric field strengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Dec 2018 09:59:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-11"}

The exact spatial sequence and\nconfiguration of amino acids, the biochemical environment and the temporal\nsequence of distinct interactions yield a complex folding process that cannot\nyet be easily tracked for all proteins. To gain qualitative insights into the\nfundamental mechanisms behind the folding dynamics and generic features of the\nfolded structure, we propose a simple model of structure formation that takes\ninto account only fundamental geometric constraints and otherwise assumes\nrandomly paired connections. We find that despite its simplicity, the model\nresults in a network ensemble consistent with key overall features of the\nensemble of Protein Residue Networks we obtained from more than 1000 biological\nprotein geometries as available through the Protein Data Base. Specifically,\nthe distribution of the number of interaction neighbors a unit (amino acid)\nhas, the scaling of the structure's spatial extent with chain length, the\neigenvalue spectrum and the scaling of the smallest relaxation time with chain\nlength are all consistent between model and real proteins. These results\nindicate that geometric constraints alone may already account for a number of\ngeneric features of protein tertiary structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Dec 2018 11:30:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-24"}

The main advantage of the Grid\ncomputing paradigm is the ability to enable, in a transparent way, the sharing\nand the coordination of several heterogeneous and large-scale distributed\nresources belonging to different institutional domains. One of its limitation\nis the lack of facilities for executing services. In fact, Grid computing has\nbeen traditionally used and improved for running computational-intensive or\ndata-intensive applications. A service differs from this kind of applications\nin that it usually waits for requests from clients and replies with useful\ninformation; moreover, a service is typically subjected to some predefined\nconstraints, called Service Level Agreement (SLA), including both temporal and\nperformance restrictions. In this paper we present the TAAROA middleware, a\nsoftware system that tries to extend the traditional target of the Grid\ncomputing paradigm to include the service concept. It attempts to accomplish\nits goal by using the virtualization technology. By abstracting the hardware\nand software resources of a computer, virtualization brings to TAAROA two\nimportant benefits: (1) the encapsulation of the service runtime environment,\nand (2) the possibility, through the migration facility, to move a service from\nthe computer where it is running to another one that hopefully reduces the risk\nof violating some of the SLA constraints. In the current version of TAAROA\nmiddleware there is no explicit mechanism for achieving the level of a service\nas defined by the related SLA; this means that actually TAAROA is only able to\nprovide a best-effort service.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Dec 2018 15:36:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-27"}

The increased demand in\ndata traffic and the limited optoelectronic component bandwidths have led to\nstate-of-the-art systems employing hundreds of separate lasers in each\ntransmitter. Given the limited optical amplifier bandwidths, focus is now\nshifting to maximize the spectral efficiency, SE. However, the frequency jitter\nfrom neighbouring lasers results in uncertainties of the exact channel\nwavelength, requiring large guardbands to avoid catastrophic channel overlap.\nOptical frequency combs with optimal line spacings (typically around 10-50 GHz)\ncan overcome these limitations and maximize the SE. Recent developments in\nmicroresonator-based soliton frequency combs (hereafter microcombs) promise a\ncompact, power efficient multi-wavelength and phase-locked light source for\noptical communications. Here we demonstrate a microcomb-based communication\nlink achieving state-of-the-art spectral efficiency that has previously only\nbeen possible with bulk-optics systems. Compared to previous microcomb works in\noptical communications, our microcomb features a narrow line spacing of 22.1\nGHz. In addition, it provides a four order-of-magnitude more stable line\nspacing compared to free-running lasers. The optical signal-to-noise ratio\n(OSNR) is sufficient for information encoding using state-of-the-art high-order\nmodulation formats. This enables us to demonstrate transmission of a 12 Tb/s\nsuperchannel over distances ranging from a single 82 km span with an SE\nexceeding 10 bits/s/Hz, to 2000 km with an SE higher than 6 bits/s/Hz.

Which of the polarized sides of the\ndebate is more responsive to politician messages and the main issues of the\nBrexit process? What is the share of bot accounts in the Brexit discussion and\nwhich side are they for? By combining the user stance classification, topic\ndiscovery, sentiment analysis, and bot detection, we show that it is possible\nto obtain useful insights about political phenomena from social media data. We\nare able to detect relevant topics in the discussions, such as the demand for a\nnew referendum, and to understand the position of social media users with\nrespect to the different topics in the debate. Our comparative and temporal\nanalysis of political accounts can detect the critical periods of the Brexit\nprocess and the impact they have on the debate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Dec 2018 13:30:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-04"}

There is increased research toward better\nunderstanding of bikesharing systems (BSS) in urban environments. However, our\ncomprehension remains incomplete on the patterns and characteristics of BSS. In\nthis paper, aiming to help improving sustainability in multimodal\ntransportation through BSS, we perform a systematic data analysis to examine\nunderlying patterns and characteristics of the system dynamics in a bikeshare\nnetwork and to acquire implications of the patterns and characteristics for\ndecision making. As a case study, we use trip history data from the Capital\nBikeshare system in the Washington DC area and some additional data sources.\nThe study covers seven important aspects of bikeshare transportation systems,\nwhich are respectively trip demand and flow, operating activities, use and idle\ntimes, trip purpose, origin-destination flows, mobility, and safety. For these\naspects, by using appropriate statistical methods and geographic techniques, we\ninvestigate travel patterns and characteristics of BSS from data to evaluate\nthe qualitative and quantitative impacts of the inputs from key stakeholders on\nmain measures of effectiveness such as trip costs, mobility, safety, quality of\nservice, and operational efficiency, where key stakeholders include road users,\nsystem operators, and city. We also disclose some new patterns and\ncharacteristics of BSS to advance the knowledge on travel behaviors. Finally,\nwe briefly summarize our findings and discuss the implications of the patterns\nand characteristics for data-driven decision supports from the relations\nbetween BSS and key stakeholders for promoting bikeshare utilization and\ntransforming urban transportation to be more sustainable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Dec 2018 18:29:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-09"}

Stringent delay and reliability requirements\nneed to be satisfied for both scheduled and non-scheduled URLLC traffic to\nenable a diverse set of 5G applications. Although physical and media access\ncontrol layer solutions have been investigated to satisfy only scheduled URLLC\ntraffic, there is a lack of study on enabling transmission of non-scheduled\nURLLC traffic, especially in coexistence with the scheduled URLLC traffic.\nMachine learning (ML) is an important enabler for such a co-existence scenario\ndue to its ability to exploit spatial/temporal correlation in user behaviors\nand use of radio resources. Hence, in this paper, we first study the\ncoexistence design challenges, especially the radio resource management (RRM)\nproblem and propose a distributed risk-aware ML solution for RRM. The proposed\nsolution benefits from hybrid orthogonal/non-orthogonal radio resource slicing,\nand proactively regulates the spectrum needed for satisfying delay/reliability\nrequirement of each URLLC traffic type. A case study is introduced to\ninvestigate the potential of the proposed RRM in serving coexisting URLLC\ntraffic types. The results further provide insights on the benefits of\nleveraging intelligent RRM, e.g. a 75% increase in data rate with respect to\nthe conservative design approach for the scheduled traffic is achieved, while\nthe 99.99% reliability of both scheduled and nonscheduled traffic types is\nsatisfied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Dec 2018 18:33:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-15"}
