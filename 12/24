Our guessing\nstrategy is based on a probabilistic construction and other combinatorial\nideas, and can be extended to show that\n${\\rm{HG}}(\\vec{C}_{n,\\ldots,n})=\\Omega(n^{\\frac{1}{r}-o(1)})$, where\n$\\vec{C}_{n,\\ldots,n}$ is the blow-up of a directed $r$-cycle, and where for\ndirected graphs each player sees only the hat colors of his outneighbors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Dec 2018 18:27:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Jan 2020 13:22:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 Jan 2020 13:22:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-16"}

Our analysis\nof publicly available data from the World Bank spanning several decades for\n~195 countries show that across and within nations over time, per capita Gross\nDomestic Product (GDP), energy use, and CO2 emissions are lowest in\npredominantly rural countries (rural > urban pop.), increase rapidly across\nurbanizing countries (rural urban pop.) and are highest in the most urban\ncountries (rural < urban pop.). These trends coincide with changes in\nemployment by sector and gender. Rural economies are based largely on\nemployment in the resource-extraction sector, which includes agriculture,\nfisheries, forestry, and mining. In urbanizing nations, male employment is\npredominantly in the industrial sector, including public utilities, while\nfemale employment is higher in service-based than resource-based economies. In\nthe most urban nations, service economies predominate with some countries\nemploying 90% of women and 65% of men in the service sector. Our analysis shows\nthat per capita GDP, energy use, and CO2 emissions increase by over two orders\nof magnitude from low-income, resource-based rural countries to high-income,\nurbanized countries with predominantly service economies.

One such dark matter model that has recently attracted much\nattention is fuzzy dark matter (FDM). In FDM models, the dark matter is\nenvisaged to be an ultra-light scalar field with a particle mass $m_{\\rm FDM}\n\\sim 10^{-22} $ eV. This yields astronomically large de Broglie wavelengths\nwhich can suppress small-scale structure formation and give rise to the\nobserved kpc-sized density cores in dwarf galaxies. We investigate the\nevolution of the 21-cm signal during Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization\n(EoR) in $\\Lambda$FDM cosmologies using analytical models. The delay in source\nformation and the absence of small halos in $\\Lambda$FDM significantly postpone\nthe Ly$\\alpha$ coupling, heating, as well as the reionization of the neutral\nhydrogen of the intergalactic medium. As a result, the absorption feature in\nthe evolution of the global 21-cm signal has a significantly smaller full width\nat half maximum ($\\Delta z \\lesssim 3$), than $\\Lambda$CDM ($\\Delta z \\simeq\n6$).

As a\nresult, $\\Lambda$FDM is not a viable solution to the potential small-scale\nproblems facing $\\Lambda$CDM.

Feature\nselection can be abstracted as a numerical linear algebra problem called the\ncolumn subset selection problem (CSSP). CSSP corresponds to selecting the best\nsubset of columns of a matrix $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d}$, where\n\\emph{best} is often meant in the sense of minimizing the approximation error,\ni.e., the norm of the residual after projection of $X$ onto the space spanned\nby the selected columns. Such an optimization over subsets of $\\{1,\\dots,d\\}$\nis usually impractical. One workaround that has been vastly explored is to\nresort to polynomial-cost, random subset selection algorithms that favor small\nvalues of this approximation error. We propose such a randomized algorithm,\nbased on sampling from a projection determinantal point process (DPP), a\nrepulsive distribution over a fixed number $k$ of indices $\\{1,\\dots,d\\}$ that\nfavors diversity among the selected columns. We give bounds on the ratio of the\nexpected approximation error for this DPP over the optimal error of PCA. These\nbounds improve over the state-of-the-art bounds of \\emph{volume sampling} when\nsome realistic structural assumptions are satisfied for $X$. Numerical\nexperiments suggest that our bounds are tight, and that our algorithms have\ncomparable performance with the \\emph{double phase} algorithm, often considered\nto be the practical state-of-the-art. Column subset selection with DPPs thus\ninherits the best of both worlds: good empirical performance and tight error\nbounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Dec 2018 20:23:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-27"}

In\ncase of thicker lubrication layers, friction may still be controlled by tuning\nthe relative concentrations of 6CB and hexane in the mixture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Dec 2018 22:38:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-27"}

Some\napplications require phase stabilization, including optical-frequency synthesis\nand measurements, optical-frequency division, and optical clocks. Partially\nstabilized microcombs can also benefit applications, such as oscillators,\nranging, dual-comb spectroscopy, wavelength calibration, and optical\ncommunications. Broad optical bandwidth, brightness, coherence, and frequency\nstability have made frequency-comb sources important for studying comb-matter\ninteractions with atoms and molecules. Here, we explore direct microcomb atomic\nspectroscopy, utilizing a cascaded, two-photon 1529-nm atomic transition of\nrubidium. Both the microcomb and the atomic vapor are implemented with planar\nfabrication techniques to support integration. By fine and simultaneous control\nof the repetition rate and carrier-envelope-offset frequency of the soliton\nmicrocomb, we obtain direct sub-Doppler and hyperfine spectroscopy of the\n$4^2D_{5/2}$ manifold. Moreover, the entire set of microcomb modes are\nstabilized to this atomic transition, yielding absolute optical-frequency\nfluctuations of the microcomb at the kilohertz-level over a few seconds and < 1\nMHz day-to-day accuracy. Our work demonstrates atomic spectroscopy with\nmicrocombs and provides a rubidium-stabilized microcomb laser source, operating\nacross the 1550 nm band for sensing, dimensional metrology, and communication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Dec 2018 22:40:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-27"}

Thus, all low-frequency ion\nheating in such plasmas is due to compressive fluctuations (\"slow modes\").\nBecause these fluctuations energetically decouple from the Alfv\\'enic ones\nalready in the inertial range, the above conclusion means that the energy\npartition between ions and electrons in low-beta plasmas is decided at the\nouter scale, where turbulence is launched, and can be determined from\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models of the relevant astrophysical systems. Any\nadditional ion heating must come from non-gyrokinetic mechanisms such as\ncyclotron heating or the stochastic heating owing to distortions of ions'\nLarmor orbits. An exception to these conclusions occurs in the Hall limit,\ni.e., when the ratio of the ion to electron temperatures is as low as the ion\nbeta (equivalently, the electron beta is order unity). In this regime, slow\nmodes couple to Alfv\\'enic ones well above the Larmor scale (viz., at the ion\ninertial or ion sound scale), so the Alfv\\'enic and compressive cascades join\nand then separate again into two cascades of fluctuations that linearly\nresemble kinetic Alfv\\'en and ion cyclotron waves, with the former heating\nelectrons and the latter ions. The two cascades are shown to decouple, scalings\nfor them are derived, and it is argued physically that the two species will be\nheated by them at approximately equal rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Dec 2018 23:06:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Apr 2019 22:46:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-04"}

To address this\nproblem, we study the morphology and genetic spatial structure of microbial\ncolonies growing on the surface of a nutrient-laden fluid $10^4$ to $10^5$\ntimes more viscous than water in Petri dishes, the extreme but finite viscosity\ninhibits undesired thermal convection and allows populations to effectively\nlive at the air-liquid interface due to capillary forces. We discover that S.\ncerevisiae (baker's yeast) growing on a viscous liquid behave like \"active\nmatter\": they metabolically generate fluid flows many times larger than their\nunperturbed colony expansion speed, and that flow, in return, can dramatically\nimpact their colony morphology and spatial population genetics. We show that\nyeast cells generate fluid flows by consuming surrounding nutrients and\ndecreasing the local substrate density, leading to misaligned fluid pressure\nand density contours, which ultimately generates vorticity via a thresholdless\nbaroclinic instability. Numerical simulations demonstrate that an intense\nvortex ring is produced below the colony's edge and quantitatively predict the\nobserved flow. As the viscosity of the substrate is lowered and the\nself-induced flow intensifies, we observe three distinct morphologies: at the\nhighest viscosity,compact circular colonies similar to those grown on hard agar\nplates except with a stretched regime of exponential expansion, intermediate\nviscosities give rise to compact colonies with \"fingers\" that are ripped away\nto break into smaller cell clusters, and at the lowest viscosity, the expanding\ncolony breaks up into many genetically-diverse, mutually repelling, island-like\nfragments of yeast colonies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Dec 2018 23:51:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-03"}

However, modeling each of\nthe large vocabulary of Chinese characters with a uniform and fixed number of\nhidden states requires high memory and computational costs and makes the tens\nof thousands of HMM state classes confusing. Another key issue of CNN-HMM for\nHCTR is the diversified writing style, which leads to model strain and a\nsignificant performance decline for specific writers. To address these issues,\nwe propose a writer-aware CNN based on parsimonious HMM (WCNN-PHMM). First,\nPHMM is designed using a data-driven state-tying algorithm to greatly reduce\nthe total number of HMM states, which not only yields a compact CNN by state\nsharing of the same or similar radicals among different Chinese characters but\nalso improves the recognition accuracy due to the more accurate modeling of\ntied states and the lower confusion among them. Second, WCNN integrates each\nconvolutional layer with one adaptive layer fed by a writer-dependent vector,\nnamely, the writer code, to extract the irrelevant variability in writer\ninformation to improve recognition performance. The parameters of\nwriter-adaptive layers are jointly optimized with other network parameters in\nthe training stage, while a multiple-pass decoding strategy is adopted to learn\nthe writer code and generate recognition results. Validated on the ICDAR 2013\ncompetition of CASIA-HWDB database, the more compact WCNN-PHMM of a 7360-class\nvocabulary can achieve a relative character error rate (CER) reduction of 16.6%\nover the conventional CNN-HMM without considering language modeling.

Although it has\nbeen known for decades that capillary flows offer an ideal method of fuel\nmanagement, there has been little research devoted to the general stability\nproperties of such flows. In this work, we demonstrate theoretically why\ncapillary flows which channel wetting liquids in slender open triangular\nchannels tend to be very stable against disturbances. By utilizing the gradient\nflow form of the governing fluid interface equation, we first prove that\nstationary interfaces in the presence of steady flow are asymptotically\nnonlinearly and exponentially stable in the Lyapunov sense. We then demonstrate\nthat fluid interfaces exhibiting self-similar Washburn dynamics are transiently\nand asymptotically linearly stable to small perturbations. This second finding\nrelies on a generalized non-modal stability analysis due to the non-normality\nof the governing disturbance operator. Taken together, these findings reveal\nthe robust nature of transient and steady capillary flows in open grooved\nchannels and likely explains the prevalent use of capillary flow management\nsystems in many emerging technologies ranging from cubesats to point-of-care\nmicrofluidic diagnostic systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Dec 2018 03:14:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-27"}

The Planar Circular Flow\nConjecture states that every $2k$-edge-connected planar graph admits a circular\n$(2+\\frac{2}{k})$-flow. The cases $k=1$ and $k=2$ are equivalent to the Four\nColor Theorem and Gr\\\"otzsch's 3-Color Theorem. For $k\\ge 3$, the conjecture\nremains open. Here we make progress when $k=4$ and $k=6$. We prove that (i)\n{\\em every 10-edge-connected planar graph admits a circular 5/2-flow} and (ii)\n{\\em every 16-edge-connected planar graph admits a circular 7/3-flow.} The dual\nversion of statement (i) on circular coloring was previously proved by\nDvo\\v{r}\\'ak and Postle (Combinatorica 2017), but our proof has the advantages\nof being much shorter and avoiding the use of computers for case-checking.\nFurther, it has new implications for antisymmetric flows. Statement (ii) is\nespecially interesting because the counterexamples to Jaeger's original\nCircular Flow Conjecture are 12-edge-connected nonplanar graphs that admit no\ncircular 7/3-flow. Thus, the planarity hypothesis of (ii) is essential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Dec 2018 05:17:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-14"}

In clinical\npractice, however, a large part of the medical imaging data available is in 3D.\nThis has motivated the development of 3D CNNs for volumetric image segmentation\nin order to benefit from more spatial context. Due to GPU memory restrictions\ncaused by moving to fully 3D, state-of-the-art methods depend on\nsubvolume/patch processing and the size of the input patch is usually small,\nlimiting the incorporation of larger context information for a better\nperformance. In this paper, we propose a novel Holistic Decomposition\nConvolution (HDC), for an effective and efficient semantic segmentation of\nvolumetric images. HDC consists of a periodic down-shuffling operation followed\nby a conventional 3D convolution. HDC has the advantage of significantly\nreducing the size of the data for sub-sequential processing while using all the\ninformation available in the input irrespective of the down-shuffling factors.\nResults obtained from comprehensive experiments conducted on hip T1 MR images\nand intervertebral disc T2 MR images demonstrate the efficacy of the present\napproach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Dec 2018 05:18:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-27"}

The parameters\nsuch as the mass and charge of the black hole, the cosmological constant, the\ncoefficient of the linear term from massive gravity $\\gamma$, and the mass of\nthe scalar are varied to study the behavior of the QNMs. We found the tower\npattern of the near-horizon quasinormal frequencies from the numerical results\nby AIM where the real parts depend only on product of the charge of the black\nhole and the scalar field and the imaginary parts depend only on the surface\ngravity.

The SRM is built\nincrementally along with the exploration process. It is a graph structure with\ncollision-free nodes and edges that are generated within the sensor coverage.\nMoreover, each node has a semantic label and the expected information gain at\nthat location. Based on the concise SRM, we present a novel and effective\ndecision-making model to determine the next-best-target (NBT) during the\nexploration. The model concerns the semantic information, the information gain,\nand the path cost to the target location. We use the nodes of SRM to represent\nthe candidate targets, which enables the target evaluation to be performed\ndirectly on the SRM. With the SRM, both the information gain of a node and the\npath cost to the node can be obtained efficiently. Besides, we adopt the\ncross-entropy method to optimize the path to make it more informative. We\nconduct experimental studies in both simulated and real-world environments,\nwhich demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Dec 2018 07:34:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-27"}

A\nmicrowave-assisted CVD set-up is presented which we constructed for the\npreparation of single-crystalline homoepitaxial diamond films. The films were\nprepared with minimized nitrogen concentration, which is confirmed through\nphotoluminescence measurements. We demonstrate an in situ ultra high vacuum\n(UHV) implantation and heating process for creation of NV centers using a novel\nexperimental set-up. For the first time hot implantation has been shown which\nprevents surface charging effects. We do not observe graphitization due to UHV\nheating. By optimizing the implantation parameters it has been possible to\nimplant NV centers in a precise way. We present large area mapping of the\nsamples to determine the distribution of the centers and describe the\ncharacterization of the centers by spectroscopic techniques. Reducing the\ndecoherence caused by environmental noise is of primary importance for many\napplications in quantum technology. We demonstrate improvement on coherence\ntime T_{2} of the NV spins by suppression of their interaction with the\nsurrounding spin-bath using robust dynamical decoupling sequences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Dec 2018 10:46:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 May 2019 15:45:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-03"}

As an example,\nwe treat in detail the important case of the SABR PDE for $\\beta = 1$, namely\n$\\partial_{\\tau}u = \\sigma^2 \\big [ \\frac{1}{2} (\\partial^2_xu - \\partial_xu) +\n\\nu \\rho \\partial_x\\partial_\\sigma u + \\frac{1}{2} \\nu^2 \\partial^2_\\sigma u \\,\n\\big ] + \\kappa (\\theta - \\sigma) \\partial_\\sigma$, by choosing $\\nu$ as small\nparameter. This yields $u = u_0 + \\nu u_1 + \\nu^2 u_2 + \\ldots$, with $u_j$\nindependent of $\\nu$. The terms $u_j$ are explicitly computable, which is also\na challenge for many other, related methods. Truncating this expansion leads to\ncomputable approximations of $u$ that are in \"closed form,\" and hence can be\nevaluated very quickly. Most of the other related methods use the \"time\" $\\tau$\nas a small parameter. The advantage of our method is that it leads to shorter\nand hence easier to determine and to generalize formulas. We obtain also an\nexplicit expansion for the implied volatility in the SABR model in terms of\n$\\nu$, similar to Hagan's formula, but including also the {\\em mean reverting\nterm.} We provide several numerical tests that show the performance of our\nmethod. In particular, we compare our formula to the one due to Hagan. Our\nresults also behave well when used for actual market data and show the mean\nreverting property of the volatility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Dec 2018 12:05:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-27"}

The\nradiation is affected by special/general relativistic effects, and can serve as\na probe of the properties of the black hole and surrounding environment, if the\naccretion geometry is properly identified. Two competing models describe the\ndisk-corona geometry for the hard spectral state of BHBs, based on spectral and\ntiming measurements. Measuring the polarization of hard X-rays reflected from\nthe disk allows the geometry to be determined. The extent of the corona differs\nbetween the two models, affecting the strength of relativistic effects (e.g.,\nenhancement of polarization fraction and rotation of polarization angle). Here,\nwe report observational results on linear polarization of hard X-ray (19-181\nkeV) emission from a BHB, Cygnus X-1, in the hard state. The low polarization\nfraction, <8.6% (upper limit at 90% confidence level), and the alignment of the\npolarization angle with the jet axis show that the dominant emission is not\ninfluenced by strong gravity. When considered together with existing spectral\nand timing data, our result reveals that the accretion corona is either an\nextended structure, or is located far from the black hole in the hard state of\nCygnus X-1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Dec 2018 12:49:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-27"}

This is in contrast to the traditional classification\nproblem where every data instance has a single label. Due to the exponential\nsize of output space, exploiting intrinsic information in feature and label\nspaces has been the major thrust of research in recent years and use of\nparametrization and embedding have been the prime focus. Researchers have\nstudied several aspects of embedding which include label embedding, input\nembedding, dimensionality reduction and feature selection. These approaches\ndiffer from one another in their capability to capture other intrinsic\nproperties such as label correlation, local invariance etc. We assume here that\nthe input data form groups and as a result, the label matrix exhibits a\nsparsity pattern and hence the labels corresponding to objects in the same\ngroup have similar sparsity. In this paper, we study the embedding of labels\ntogether with the group information with an objective to build an efficient\nmulti-label classification. We assume the existence of a low-dimensional space\nonto which the feature vectors and label vectors can be embedded. In order to\nachieve this, we address three sub-problems namely; (1) Identification of\ngroups of labels; (2) Embedding of label vectors to a low rank-space so that\nthe sparsity characteristic of individual groups remains invariant; and (3)\nDetermining a linear mapping that embeds the feature vectors onto the same set\nof points, as in stage 2, in the low-dimensional space.

In order to transfer the information from an exemplar to an input\nimage, existing methods often use a normalization technique, e.g., adaptive\ninstance normalization, that controls the channel-wise statistics of an input\nactivation map at a particular layer, such as the mean and the variance.\nMeanwhile, style transfer approaches similar task to image translation by\nnature, demonstrated superior performance by using the higher-order statistics\nsuch as covariance among channels in representing a style. In detail, it works\nvia whitening (given a zero-mean input feature, transforming its covariance\nmatrix into the identity). followed by coloring (changing the covariance matrix\nof the whitened feature to those of the style feature). However, applying this\napproach in image translation is computationally intensive and error-prone due\nto the expensive time complexity and its non-trivial backpropagation.

With simplicity, no maintenance, no power\nconsumption, and low cost, permanent magnets or arrays are attractive to use as\na source of magnetic field to realize portability and low cost for a scanners.\nHowever, when taking the Fourier imaging approach and using linear gradient\nfields, homogeneous fields are required, thus either a bulky magnet is needed,\nor the imaging volume is too small to image an organ if the magnet is scaled\ndown. Recently, with the progress on image reconstruction based on non-linear\ngradient field, field patterns without spatial-linearity can be used as spatial\nencoding magnetic fields to encode MRI signals for imaging. As a result, the\nrequirements for the homogeneity of the field can be relaxed, which allows\npermanent magnets(arrays) with reduced sizes, reduced weight to image bigger\nvolumes covering organs such as a head. It offers chances to construct a truly\nportable low-cost MRI scanner. For this exciting potential application,\npermanent magnets(arrays) have attracted increased attention.

To minimize signaling overhead, an adhoc\napproach is being considered for users communicating in the unlicensed and\nshared spectrums. For such users, decisions need to be completely decentralized\nas: 1) No communication between users and signaling from the base station is\npossible which necessitates independent channel selection at each user. A\ncollision occurs when multiple users transmit simultaneously on the same\nchannel, 2) Channel qualities may be heterogeneous, i.e., they are not same\nacross all users, and moreover, are unknown, and 3) The network could be\ndynamic where users can enter or leave anytime. We develop a multi-armed bandit\nbased distributed algorithm for static networks and extend it for the dynamic\nnetworks. The algorithms aim to achieve stable orthogonal allocation (SOC) in\nfinite time and meet the above three constraints with two novel\ncharacteristics: 1) Low complexity narrowband radio compared to wideband radio\nin existing works, and 2) Epoch-less approach for dynamic networks. We\nestablish a convergence of our algorithms to SOC and validate via extensive\nsimulation experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Dec 2018 12:29:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Jul 2019 18:20:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-12"}

We find that the\nsum-of-the-digits of prime numbers does not have an equal probability of being\nodd or even. The authors know of no reason why prime numbers should bias\nthemselves towards a particular parity in their sums of digits, but our\nempirical tests show a very strong bias; strong enough that we are able to\ndevise a test to reliably differentiate between collections of prime numbers\nversus random numbers by looking only at their sums of digits. We are also able\nto create similar tests for products of primes. We are even able to test\n\"tainted\" sets with mixtures of primes and random numbers: as the percentage of\n(randomly chosen) prime numbers in a set of random numbers is varied, we get a\nreliable, linear change in our parity measure. For example, when we add up the\ndigits of prime numbers in base 10, their sum is significantly more likely to\nbe odd than even. This effect persists across base changes, although which\nparity is more common might change. Note that the last digit being odd in base\n10 simply reverses the parity. We have tested this for the first fifty million\nprimes -- not primes up to 50,000,000, but the first 50,000,000 prime numbers\n-- and have found that this effect persists, and does so in a predictable\nmanner. The effect is quite significant; for 50,000,000 primes in base 10, the\nnumber of primes which have an odd sum-of-digits is about an order of magnitude\nfarther away from the mean than expected. We have run multiple tests to try and\nunderstand the source of this bias, including investigating primes modulo\nrandom numbers and adjusting for Chebyshev's bias. None of these tests yielded\nany satisfactory explanation for this phenomenon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Dec 2018 17:01:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-01"}

The presence of white matter lesions biases morphometric analyses such\nas registration, individual longitudinal measurements and tissue segmentation\nfor brain volume measurements. Lesion-inpainting with intensities derived from\nsurrounding healthy tissue represents one approach to alleviate such problems.\nHowever, existing methods inpaint lesions based on texture information derived\nfrom local surrounding tissue, often leading to inconsistent inpainting and the\ngeneration of artifacts such as intensity discrepancy and blurriness. Based on\nthese observations, we propose non-local partial convolutions (NLPC) that\nintegrates a Unet-like network with the non-local module. The non-local module\nis exploited to capture long range dependencies between the lesion area and\nremaining normal-appearing brain regions. Then, the lesion area is filled by\nreferring to normal-appearing regions with more similar features. This method\ngenerates inpainted regions that appear more realistic and natural.

Its physical nature has however remained enigmatic. Here we use\nthe Einstein equations without cosmological constant to show that the origin of\nthe accelerated expansion is not in the equations but has to do with the\nboundary conditions related to the causal horizon, which exists because the age\nof the universe is finite. Via transformations to conformal coordinates and\nEuclidian spacetime we find a resonance condition that uniquely determines the\ndimensionless parameter $\\Omega_\\Lambda$ that governs the observed cosmic\nacceleration: $\\Omega_\\Lambda =\\textstyle{2\\over 3}\\,(\\pi\\, t_H/t_c)^2$, where\n$t_H$ is the Hubble time and $t_c$ is the conformal age of the universe. This\nexplanation leads to a somewhat modified cosmology, in which the expansion rate\nof the early universe is 2.1 times faster than in the standard model. We show\nthat Big Bang nucleosynthesis calculations with the faster expansion rate\nrequires the mean baryon density to be raised to the level of the total matter\ndensity to agree with the observed deuterium abundance. This appears to\neliminate the need to invoke the existence of some yet to be discovered exotic\nparticles to explain dark matter, since all of it may be baryonic while still\nremaining consistent with the observed abundances of the light elements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Dec 2018 15:17:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-08"}

The performance\nof these intra-chip networks is a key determinant of the processor speed and,\nat high core counts, becomes an important bottleneck due to scalability issues.\nTo address this, several works propose the use of mm-wave wireless\ninterconnects for intra-chip communication and demonstrate that, thanks to\ntheir low-latency broadcast and system-level flexibility, this new paradigm\ncould break the scalability barriers of current multicore architectures.\nHowever, these same works assume 10+ Gb/s speeds and efficiencies close to 1\npJ/bit without a proper understanding on the wireless intra-chip channel. This\npaper first demonstrates that such assumptions do not hold in the context of\ncommercial chips by evaluating losses and dispersion in them. Then, we leverage\nthe system's monolithic nature to engineer the channel, this is, to optimize\nits frequency response by carefully choosing the chip package dimensions.\nFinally, we exploit the static nature of the channel to adapt to it, pushing\nefficiency-speed limits with simple tweaks at the physical layer.
