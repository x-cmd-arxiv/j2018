However, to\ntrain CNNs requires a considerable amount of data, which is difficult to\ncollect and laborious to annotate. Recent advances in computer graphics make it\npossible to train CNNs on photo-realistic synthetic imagery with\ncomputer-generated annotations. Despite this, the domain mismatch between the\nreal images and the synthetic data hinders the models' performance. Hence, we\npropose a curriculum-style learning approach to minimizing the domain gap in\nurban scene semantic segmentation. The curriculum domain adaptation solves easy\ntasks first to infer necessary properties about the target domain; in\nparticular, the first task is to learn global label distributions over images\nand local distributions over landmark superpixels. These are easy to estimate\nbecause images of urban scenes have strong idiosyncrasies (e.g., the size and\nspatial relations of buildings, streets, cars, etc.). We then train a\nsegmentation network, while regularizing its predictions in the target domain\nto follow those inferred properties.

This historic detection has been instrumental\nin providing constraints on the tidal polarizability of neutron stars. In turn,\nthe tidal polarizability has been used to impose limits on stellar radii and\nultimately on the equation of state (EOS). The tidal polarizability is also\nsensitive to the second tidal Love number k2. It is the main purpose of this\nwork to perform a detailed study of k2 which, for a given compactness\nparameter, encodes the entire sensitivity of the tidal polarizability to the\nEOS. In particular, we examine the role that the crustal component of the EOS\nplays in the determination of k2. A set of realistic models of the equation of\nstate that yield an accurate description of the properties of finite nuclei and\nsupport neutron stars of two solar masses is used. Given that the tidal\npolarizability scales as the fifth power of the compactness parameter, a\nuniversal relation exists among the tidal polarizability and the compactness\nparameter that is highly insensitive to the underlying EOS. Thus, besides an\nextraction of the tidal polarizabilities, a measurement of the individual\nstellar masses is also required to impact the mass-radius relation. However, we\nobserve a strong sensitivity of k2 to the EOS, particularly to the contribution\nfrom the inner crust. Although by itself the tidal polarizability can not\ncontribute to the determination of the mass-radius relation, future detections\nof binary neutron star mergers are poised to provide significant constraints on\nboth the tidal polarizabilities and masses of the individual stars, and thus\nultimately on the mass-radius relation. Yet, subleading corrections to the\ntidal polarizability are encoded in the second Love number k2 which displays a\nlarge sensitivity to the entire (crust-plus-core) EOS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Dec 2018 19:48:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-01"}

Likewise,\nprobabilistic conditional independences (CI) are crucial for reasoning about\nmultivariate probability distributions. The implication problem studies whether\na set of constraints (antecedents) implies another constraint (consequent), and\nhas been investigated in both the database and the AI literature, under the\nassumption that all constraints hold exactly. However, many applications today\nconsider constraints that hold only approximately. In this paper we define an\napproximate implication as a linear inequality between the degree of\nsatisfaction of the antecedents and consequent, and we study the relaxation\nproblem: when does an exact implication relax to an approximate implication? We\nuse information theory to define the degree of satisfaction, and prove several\nresults. First, we show that any implication from a set of data dependencies\n(MVDs+FDs) can be relaxed to a simple linear inequality with a factor at most\nquadratic in the number of variables; when the consequent is an FD, the factor\ncan be reduced to 1. Second, we prove that there exists an implication between\nCIs that does not admit any relaxation; however, we prove that every\nimplication between CIs relaxes \"in the limit\". Then, we show that the\nimplication problem for differential constraints in market basket analysis also\nadmits a relaxation with a factor equal to 1. Finally, we show how some of the\nresults in the paper can be derived using the I-measure theory, which relates\nbetween information theoretic measures and set theory. Our results recover, and\nsometimes extend, previously known results about the implication problem: the\nimplication of MVDs and FDs can be checked by considering only 2-tuple\nrelations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Dec 2018 21:43:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Jan 2019 20:21:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 3 Apr 2019 22:59:43 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 22 Nov 2020 16:42:52 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 2020 07:49:43 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sun, 1 Aug 2021 12:38:54 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2021 09:14:24 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2022 13:51:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

In this paper we demonstrate that when the loss has certain\nproperties over a minimally small neighborhood of the initial point, first\norder methods such as (stochastic) gradient descent have a few intriguing\nproperties: (1) the iterates converge at a geometric rate to a global optima\neven when the loss is nonconvex, (2) among all global optima of the loss the\niterates converge to one with a near minimal distance to the initial point, (3)\nthe iterates take a near direct route from the initial point to this global\noptima.

It will significantly enhance\nuser experience and satisfaction. However, due to the challenges of inferring\nthe rich yet complicated set of compatibility patterns in a large e-commerce\ncorpus of fashion items, this task is still underexplored. Inspired by the\nrecent advances in multi-relational knowledge representation learning and deep\nneural networks, this paper proposes a novel Translation-based Neural Fashion\nCompatibility Modeling (TransNFCM) framework, which jointly optimizes fashion\nitem embeddings and category-specific complementary relations in a unified\nspace via an end-to-end learning manner. TransNFCM places items in a unified\nembedding space where a category-specific relation (category-comp-category) is\nmodeled as a vector translation operating on the embeddings of compatible items\nfrom the corresponding categories. By this way, we not only capture the\nspecific notion of compatibility conditioned on a specific pair of\ncomplementary categories, but also preserve the global notion of compatibility.\nWe also design a deep fashion item encoder which exploits the complementary\ncharacteristic of visual and textual features to represent the fashion\nproducts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that uses\ncategory-specific complementary relations to model the category-aware\ncompatibility between items in a translation-based embedding space. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the effectiveness of TransNFCM over the\nstate-of-the-arts on two real-world datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Dec 2018 03:55:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-27"}

A practical and critical problem thus has emerged: how to\neffectively deploy the deep neural network models such that they can be\nexecuted efficiently. Conventional cloud-based approaches usually run the deep\nmodels in data center servers, causing large latency because a significant\namount of data has to be transferred from the edge of network to the data\ncenter. In this paper, we propose JALAD, a joint accuracy- and latency-aware\nexecution framework, which decouples a deep neural network so that a part of it\nwill run at edge devices and the other part inside the conventional cloud,\nwhile only a minimum amount of data has to be transferred between them. Though\nthe idea seems straightforward, we are facing challenges including i) how to\nfind the best partition of a deep structure; ii) how to deploy the component at\nan edge device that only has limited computation power; and iii) how to\nminimize the overall execution latency. Our answers to these questions are a\nset of strategies in JALAD, including 1) A normalization based in-layer data\ncompression strategy by jointly considering compression rate and model\naccuracy; 2) A latency-aware deep decoupling strategy to minimize the overall\nexecution latency; and 3) An edge-cloud structure adaptation strategy that\ndynamically changes the decoupling for different network conditions.\nExperiments demonstrate that our solution can significantly reduce the\nexecution latency: it speeds up the overall inference execution with a\nguaranteed model accuracy loss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Dec 2018 04:46:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-05"}

The backbone of MMFNet is designed as\na multi-encoder-based network, consisting of several encoders to capture\nmodality-specific features and one single decoder to fuse them and obtain\nhigh-level features for NPC segmentation. A fusion block is presented to\neffectively fuse features from multi-modality MRI. It firstly recalibrates\nlow-level features captured from modality-specific encoders to highlight both\ninformative features and regions of interest, then fuses weighted features by a\nresidual fusion block to keep balance between fused ones and high-level\nfeatures from decoder. Moreover, a training strategy named self-transfer, which\nutilizes pre-trained modality-specific encoders to initialize\nmulti-encoder-based network, is proposed to make full mining of information\nfrom different modalities of MRI. The proposed method based on multi-modality\nMRI can effectively segment NPC and its advantages are validated by extensive\nexperiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Dec 2018 05:19:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2019 10:23:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 5 May 2019 12:39:40 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 9 May 2019 03:06:22 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 27 May 2019 05:48:07 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2019 08:53:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-23"}

Scaling semantic parsing to\narbitrary domains faces two interrelated challenges: obtaining broad coverage\ntraining data effectively and cheaply; and developing a model that generalizes\nto compositional utterances and complex intentions. We address these challenges\nwith a framework which allows to elicit training data from a domain ontology\nand bootstrap a neural parser which recursively builds derivations of logical\nforms. In our framework meaning representations are described by sequences of\nnatural language templates, where each template corresponds to a decomposed\nfragment of the underlying meaning representation. Although artificial,\ntemplates can be understood and paraphrased by humans to create natural\nutterances, resulting in parallel triples of utterances, meaning\nrepresentations, and their decompositions. These allow us to train a neural\nsemantic parser which learns to compose rules in deriving meaning\nrepresentations. We crowdsource training data on six domains, covering both\nsingle-turn utterances which exhibit rich compositionality, and sequential\nutterances where a complex task is procedurally performed in steps. We then\ndevelop neural semantic parsers which perform such compositional tasks. In\ngeneral, our approach allows to deploy neural semantic parsers quickly and\ncheaply from a given domain ontology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Dec 2018 05:30:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-27"}

Despite their\neffectiveness and extensive popularity, they are not without their exploitable\nflaws. Initially applied to computer vision systems, the generation of\nadversarial examples is a process in which seemingly imperceptible\nperturbations are made to an image, with the purpose of inducing a deep\nlearning based classifier to misclassify the image. Due to recent trends in\nspeech processing, this has become a noticeable issue in speech recognition\nmodels. In late 2017, an attack was shown to be quite effective against the\nSpeech Commands classification model. Limited-vocabulary speech classifiers,\nsuch as the Speech Commands model, are used quite frequently in a variety of\napplications, particularly in managing automated attendants in telephony\ncontexts. As such, adversarial examples produced by this attack could have\nreal-world consequences. While previous work in defending against these\nadversarial examples has investigated using audio preprocessing to reduce or\ndistort adversarial noise, this work explores the idea of flooding particular\nfrequency bands of an audio signal with random noise in order to detect\nadversarial examples. This technique of flooding, which does not require\nretraining or modifying the model, is inspired by work done in computer vision\nand builds on the idea that speech classifiers are relatively robust to natural\nnoise. A combined defense incorporating 5 different frequency bands for\nflooding the signal with noise outperformed other existing defenses in the\naudio space, detecting adversarial examples with 91.8% precision and 93.5%\nrecall.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Dec 2018 08:02:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-26"}

To learn from these heterogenous input sources,\nexisting methods reply on two-stream architectural designs that contain\nindependent, parallel streams of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). However,\ntwo-stream RNNs do not fully exploit the reciprocal information contained in\nthe multiple signals, let alone exploit it in a recurrent manner. To this end,\nwe propose in this paper a novel recurrent architecture, termed Coupled\nRecurrent Network (CRN), to deal with multiple input sources.

Most defense algorithms prevent these threats by finding\ndifferences between the original images and adversarial examples. However, the\nfound differences do not contain features about the classes, so these defense\nalgorithms can only detect adversarial examples without recovering the correct\nlabels. In this regard, we propose the Adversarial Feature Genome (AFG), a\nnovel type of data that contains both the differences and features about\nclasses. This method is inspired by an observed phenomenon, namely the\nAdversarial Feature Separability (AFS), where the difference between the\nfeature maps of the original images and adversarial examples becomes larger\nwith deeper layers. On top of that, we further develop an adversarial example\nrecognition framework that detects adversarial examples and can recover the\ncorrect labels.

In\nthis paper, we present an analysis framework for description of these\nevolutions during propagation of a short intense laser pulse in a sub-critical\nhigh-density plasma (the pulse length exceeds the plasma wavelength). In this\ncontext, the pulse evolutions are attributed to the wakefield induced\nself-modulation and destabilization via parametric exponentiation of the\ninitial noise content. The self-consistent plasma evolutions are formulated in\nterms of quantities which used to be motion constants in the absence of pulse\nevolutions. This proves very useful both in understanding plasma evolutions\nduring self-modulation and also in facilitating the instability studies in the\nstrongly nonlinear regime, via refinement of unstable plasma perturbations.\nGeneral analytical solutions, at arbitrary pulse conditions, are derived for\nself-modulation, indicating that the envelop evolutions are driven by the\ninduced spatial frequency-chirp. Also, these results state that the envelope\nattains fine modulations which produce long wavelength low-frequency modes via\nbeating the carrier mode. The plasma wave variations are found to convect and\namplify away from the pulse front.

Understanding differences\nbetween shapes and modeling the variability within and across shape classes,\nhereinafter referred to as \\emph{shape analysis}, are fundamental problems to\nmany applications, ranging from computer vision and computer graphics to\nbiology and medicine. This chapter provides an overview of some of the recent\ntechniques that studied the shape of 3D objects that undergo non-rigid\ndeformations including bending and stretching. Recent surveys that covered some\naspects such classification, retrieval, recognition, and rigid or nonrigid\nregistration, focused on methods that use shape descriptors. Descriptors,\nhowever, provide abstract representations that do not enable the exploration of\nshape variability. In this chapter, we focus on recent techniques that treated\nthe shape of 3D objects as points in some high dimensional space where paths\ndescribe deformations. Equipping the space with a suitable metric enables the\nquantification of the range of deformations of a given shape, which in turn\nenables (1) comparing and classifying 3D objects based on their shape, (2)\ncomputing smooth deformations, i.e. geodesics, between pairs of objects, and\n(3) modeling and exploring continuous shape variability in a collection of 3D\nmodels.

This critical issue\ncan be addressed in levitodynamics, where the nanoresonator typically consists\nof a single silica nanoparticle of well-defined mass.

Under the rubric of MCDP, the tumor foci to be detected are\nregarded as solutions of the objective function, the tissue region around the\ncancer areas represents the parameter space, and the nanorobots loaded with\ncontrast medium molecules for cancer detection correspond to the optimization\nagents. The process that the nanorobots detect tumors by swimming in the\nhigh-risk tissue region can be regarded as the process that the agents search\nfor the solutions of an objective function in the parameter space with some\nconstraints. For multimodal optimization (MMO) aiming to locate multiple\noptimal solutions in a single simulation run, niche technology has been widely\nused. Specifically, the Niche Genetic Algorithm (NGA) has been shown to be\nparticularly effective in solving MMO. It can be used to identify the global\noptima of multiple hump functions in a running, keep effectively the diversity\nof the population, and avoid premature of the genetic algorithm. Learning from\nthe optimization procedure of NGA, we propose the NGA-inspired MCDP in order to\nlocate the tumor targets efficiently while taking into account realistic in\nvivo propagation and controlling of nanorobots, which is different from the use\nscenario of the standard NGA. To improve the performance of the MCDP, we also\nmodify the crossover operator of the original NGA from crossing within a\npopulation to crossing between two populations. Finally, we present\ncomprehensive numerical examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nNGA-inspired MCDP when the biological objective function is associated with the\nblood flow velocity profile caused by tumor-induced angiogenesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Dec 2018 09:17:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-01"}

We aim to demonstrate through\ncomputational experiments that the proposed DTS can significantly enhance the\naccumulation of MNPs in the tumor site, which serve as a contrast agent in\nvarious medical imaging modalities, by using the shortest possible\nphysiological routes and with minimal systemic exposure. Methods: The epicenter\nof a tumor corresponds to the global maximum of an externally measurable\nobjective function associated with an in vivo tumor-triggered biophysical\ngradient; the domain of the objective function is the tissue region at a high\nrisk of malignancy; swarms of externally controllable magnetic nanoswimmers for\ntumor sensitization are modeled as the guess inputs. The objective function may\nbe resulted from a passive phenomenon such as reduced blood flow or increased\nkurtosis of microvasculature due to tumor angiogenesis; otherwise, the\nobjective function may involve an active phenomenon such as the fibrin formed\nduring the coagulation cascade activated by tumortargeted \"activator\"\nnanoparticles. Subsequently, the DTS can be interpreted from the iterative\noptimization perspective: guess inputs (i.e., swarms of nanoswimmers) are\ncontinuously updated according to the gradient of the objective function in\norder to find the optimum (i.e., tumor) by moving through the domain (i.e.,\ntissue under screening). Along this line of thought, we propose the\ncomputational model based on the gradient descent (GD) iterative method to\ndescribe the GD-inspired DTS, which takes into account the realistic in vivo\npropagation scenario of nanoswimmers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Dec 2018 08:25:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-03"}

Does the\noscillating charge lose its mechanical energy similar to a radiating dipole,\neven though it seems to lose no mechanical energy within each region of\nconstant acceleration? In this paper, I will show how mechanical energy is\ntransferred to radiation energy via the Schott energy when the particle crosses\nthe boundary between the two regions.
