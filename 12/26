In each step, a ribosome elongates a protein by a single\nunit using the track also as a template for protein synthesis. But,\npre-fabricated, functionally competent, ribosomes are not available to begin\nsynthesis of protein; a subunit directionally scans the mRNA in search of the\npre-designated site where it is supposed to bind with the other subunit and\nbegin the synthesis of the corresponding protein. However, because of `leaky'\nscanning, a fraction of the scanning subunits miss the target site and continue\ntheir search beyond the first target. Sometimes such scanners successfully\nidentify the site that marks the site for initiation of the synthesis of a\ndifferent protein. In this paper, we develop an exclusion model, with three\ninterconvertible species of hard rods, to capture some of the key features of\nthese biological phenomena and study the effects of the interference of the\nflow of the different species of rods on the same lattice.

Related to non-stabilizer state manipulation is\nthe resource theory of non-stabilizer states, for which one of the goals is to\ncharacterize and quantify non-stabilizerness of a quantum state. In this paper,\nwe introduce the family of thauma measures to quantify the amount of\nnon-stabilizerness in a quantum state, and we exploit this family of measures\nto address several open questions in the resource theory of non-stabilizer\nstates. As a first application, we establish the hypothesis testing thauma as\nan efficiently computable benchmark for the one-shot distillable\nnon-stabilizerness, which in turn leads to a variety of bounds on the rate at\nwhich non-stabilizerness can be distilled, as well as on the overhead of\nmagic-state distillation. We then prove that the max-thauma can be used as an\nefficiently computable tool in benchmarking the efficiency of magic-state\ndistillation and that it can outperform pervious approaches based on mana.\nFinally, we use the min-thauma to bound a quantity known in the literature as\nthe \"regularized relative entropy of magic.\" As a consequence of this bound, we\nfind that two classes of states with maximal mana, a previously established\nnon-stabilizerness measure, cannot be interconverted in the asymptotic regime\nat a rate equal to one. This result resolves a basic question in the resource\ntheory of non-stabilizer states and reveals a difference between the resource\ntheory of non-stabilizer states and other resource theories such as\nentanglement and coherence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Dec 2018 17:57:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 15 Feb 2020 07:03:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-11"}

We highlight that\naccounting for the next-nearest-neighbor hopping terms in doped Graphene can\nlead to a unique redistribution of magnetic fluxes within the unit cell of the\nlattice. While this affects all the fQH states, it has a striking effect at a\nhalf-filled Landau-level state: it leads to a composite fermion state that is\nequivalent to the doped topological Chern insulator on a honeycomb lattice.

Each\nrobot can move anywhere in $T$ independently of other robots with maximum speed\none. The goal of the robots is to \\emph{evacuate} $T$ through an exit at an\nunknown location on the boundary of $T$. The objective is to minimize the\n\\emph{evacuation time}, which is defined as the time the \\emph{last} robot\nreaches the exit. We consider the \\emph{face-to-face} communication model for\nthe robots: a robot can communicate with another robot only when they meet in\n$T$.\n  In this paper, we give upper and lower bounds for the face-to-face evacuation\ntime by $k$ robots that are initially located at the centroid of a unit-sided\nequilateral triangle or square. For the case of a triangle with $k=2$ robots,\nwe give a lower bound of $1+2/\\sqrt{3} \\approx 2.154$, and an algorithm with\nupper bound of 2.3367 on the worst-case evacuation time. We show that for any\n$k$, any algorithm for evacuating $k\\geq 2$ robots requires at least $\\sqrt{3}$\ntime. This bound is asymptotically optimal, as we show that even a\nstraightforward strategy of evacuation by $k$ robots gives an upper bound of\n$\\sqrt{3} + 3/k$. For $k=3$ and $4$, we give better algorithms with evacuation\ntimes of 2.0887 and 1.9816, respectively. For the case of the square and $k=2$,\nwe give an algorithm with evacuation time of $3.4645$ and show that any\nalgorithm requires time at least $3.118$ to evacuate in the worst-case.\nMoreover, for $k=3$, and $4$, we give algorithms with evacuation times 3.1786\nand 2.6646, respectively. The algorithms given for $k=3$ and $4$ for evacuation\nin the triangle or the square can be easily generalized for larger values of\n$k$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Dec 2018 19:40:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-27"}

The problem originates in the emission of\nradiation by an accelerated charge, which must result with a loss of energy and\nrecoil of the charge, adding a correction to the well-known Lorentz force. When\nradiation reaction is neglected, it is well known that the dynamics of a charge\nin a plane-wave laser field are inevitably periodic. Here we investigate the\nlong-time dynamics of a charge in a plane wave and show that all current models\nof radiation reaction strictly forbid periodic dynamics. Consequently, we find\nthat the loss of energy due to radiation reaction actually causes particles to\nasymptotically accelerate to infinite kinetic energy. Such a phenomenon\npersists even in weak laser fields and puts forward the possibility of testing\nthe open problem of radiation reaction through long-duration weak-field\nprecision measurements, rather than through strong-field experiments.

It\nstates that symmetric processes associated with resistance metric measure\nspaces converge when the underlying spaces converge with respect to the\nGromov-Hausdorff-vague topology, and a certain uniform recurrence condition is\nsatisfied. Such a theorem finds particularly nice applications if the\nresistance metric measure space is a metric measure tree. To illustrate this,\nwe state functional limit theorems in old and new examples of suitably rescaled\nrandom walks in random environment on trees. First, we take a critical\nGalton-Watson tree conditioned on its total progeny and a non-lattice branching\nrandom walk on $\\mathbb{R}^d$ indexed by it. Then, conditional on that, we\nconsider a biased random walk on the range of the preceding.

Appropriate\nboundary conditions are established by requiring that the bulk and edge spins\nprecess with the same frequency for any given spin wave eigenmode in these\nsystems. A set of characteristic boundary equations, common for bulk and edge\nspin wave modes, are hence derived. The equations of motion for the spin\ndynamics are then solved to determine the propagating and evanescent exchange\nspin wave modes. We prove in general that the bulk spin wave dynamics is\ndiscretized due to the finite width of the nanoribbon. For an isotropic\nmagnetic nanoribbon, the Dirac cone is reduced to a single linear dispersion\ncurve due to this discretization. The number and wavelengths of allowed bulk\nmodes for isotropic and anisotropic nanoribbons are determined from the derived\ncharacteristic boundary equations. As witnessed by our numerical results for\ndifferent examples it is shown that the characteristics of these modes depend\non the width of the nanoribbon and its antiferromagnetic anisotropy.

The spatial variation of\nthe amplitudes of the evanescent exchange spin waves across the finite widths\nof the nanoribbons, is found to be strongly dependent on the system magnetic\nanisotropy and its width.

Furthermore,\nthe effects of the rotating harmonic potential and spin-orbit coupling are\nnumerically studied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Dec 2018 04:18:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

Most of the existing methods rely on 2D convolutional\nnetworks (ConvNets) to extract frame-wise deep features which are pooled\ntemporally to generate the video-level representations. However, 2D ConvNets\nlose temporal input information immediately after the convolution, and a\nseparate temporal pooling is limited in capturing human motion in shorter\nsequences. To this end, we present a \\textit{global} video representation (3D\nPersonVLAD), complementary to 3D ConvNets as a novel layer to capture the\nappearance and motion dynamics in full-length videos. However, encoding each\nvideo frame in its entirety and computing an aggregate global representation\nacross all frames is tremendously challenging due to occlusions and\nmisalignments. To resolve this, our proposed network is further augmented with\n3D part alignment module to learn local features through soft-attention module.\nThese attended features are statistically aggregated to yield\nidentity-discriminative representations.

In this paper, we investigate the evolution of active region NOAA\n12268 within 36 hours from 2015 January 29 to 30, during which a flux rope was\nformed and three M-class and three C-class flares were triggered without\ncoronal mass ejections. During the evolution of the active region, the flare\nemission seen in the H$\\alpha$ and ultraviolet wavebands changed from a\ncircular shape (plus an adjacent conjugated ribbon and a remote ribbon) to\nthree relatively straight and parallel ribbons. Based on a series of\nreconstructed nonlinear force-free fields, we find sheared or twisted magnetic\nfield lines and a large-scale quasi-separatrix layer (QSL) associated with 3D\nnull points in a quadrupolar magnetic field. These features always existed and\nconstantly evolved during the two days. The twist of the flux rope was\ngradually accumulated that eventually led to its instability. Around the flux\nrope, there were some topological structures, including a bald patch, a\nhyperbolic flux tube and a torus QSL. We discuss how the particular magnetic\nstructure and its evolution produce the flare emission. In particular, the\nbifurcation of the flux rope can explain the transition of the flares from\ncircular to parallel ribbons. We propose a two-stage evolution of the magnetic\nstructure and its associated flares. In the first stage, sheared arcades under\nthe dome-like large-scale QSL were gradually transformed into a flux rope\nthrough magnetic reconnection, which produced the circular ribbon flare. In the\nsecond stage, the flux rope bifurcated to form the three relatively straight\nand parallel flare ribbons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Dec 2018 04:57:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-12"}

For the massless theory we find that the SJ\nvacuum can neither be obtained from the $O(4)$ Fock vacuum of Allen and Folacci\nnor from the non-Fock de Sitter invariant vacuum of Kirsten and Garriga. Using\na causal set discretisation of a slab of 2d and 4d de Sitter spacetime, we find\nthe causal set SJ vacuum for a range of masses $m \\geq 0$ of the free scalar\nfield. While our simulations are limited to a finite volume slab of global de\nSitter spacetime, they show good convergence as the volume is increased. We\nfind that the 4d causal set SJ vacuum shows a significant departure from the\ncontinuum Motolla-Allen $\\alpha$-vacua. Moreover, the causal set SJ vacuum is\nwell-defined for both the minimally coupled massless $m=0$ and the conformally\ncoupled massless $m=m_c$ cases. This is at odds with earlier work on the\ncontinuum de Sitter SJ vacuum where it was argued that the continuum SJ vacuum\nis ill-defined for these masses. Our results hint at an important tension\nbetween the discrete and continuum behaviour of the SJ vacuum in de Sitter and\nsuggest that the former cannot in general be identified with the Mottola-Allen\n$\\alpha$-vacua even for $m>0$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Dec 2018 05:06:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 28 Jul 2019 08:13:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-30"}

A popular primal-dual first-order method for this problem is to\nperform a gradient projection iteration for the augmented Lagrangian function\nand then update the dual multiplier vector using the constraint residual.\nHowever, numerical examples show that this approach can exhibit \"oscillation\"\nand may not converge. In this paper, we propose a proximal alternating\ndirection method of multipliers for the multi-block version of this problem. A\ndistinctive feature of this method is the introduction of a \"smoothed\" (i.e.,\nexponentially weighted) sequence of primal iterates, and the inclusion, at each\niteration, to the augmented Lagrangian function a quadratic proximal term\ncentered at the current smoothed primal iterate. The resulting proximal\naugmented Lagrangian function is inexactly minimized (via a gradient projection\nstep) at each iteration while the dual multiplier vector is updated using the\nresidual of the linear constraints. When the primal and dual stepsizes are\nchosen sufficiently small, we show that suitable \"smoothing\" can stabilize the\n\"oscillation\", and the iterates of the new proximal ADMM algorithm converge to\na stationary point under some mild regularity conditions.

Starting from\nthis intuition, we propose a novel encoder-refiner-decoder framework, which\ndynamically refines the source representations based on the generated\ntarget-side information at each decoding step.

Probabilistic inversion\nmethods, despite their great potential in uncertainty quantification, still\nremain a formidable computational task. In this paper, I explore the potential\nof deep learning methods for electromagnetic inversion. This approach does not\nrequire calculation of the gradient and provides results instantaneously. Deep\nneural networks based on fully convolutional architecture are trained on large\nsynthetic datasets obtained by full 3-D simulations. The performance of the\nmethod is demonstrated on models of strong practical relevance representing an\nonshore controlled source electromagnetic CO2 monitoring scenario. The\npre-trained networks can reliably estimate the position and lateral dimensions\nof the anomalies, as well as their resistivity properties. Several fully\nconvolutional network architectures are compared in terms of their accuracy,\ngeneralization, and cost of training.

Although several properties of FBS are similar to the cuprates\n(large upper critical fields, resulting from a short coherence lengths, and\nsmall carrier density), others are distinctly different. For instance, in FBS\nthe symmetry of the superconducting order parameter is most likely not a d-wave\nbut an s+-wave, depending on the stoichiometry, crystallographic system, and\ndoping level. Additionally, the critical current densities of FBS are less\nsensitive to the presence of grain boundaries (GBs) than those of the high-Tc\ncuprates.

First, we summarize a general\npipeline that deep facial attribute analysis follows, which comprises two\nstages: data preprocessing and model construction. Additionally, we introduce\nthe underlying theories of this two-stage pipeline for both FAE and FAM.\nSecond, the datasets and performance metrics commonly used in facial attribute\nanalysis are presented. Third, we create a taxonomy of state-of-the-art methods\nand review deep FAE and FAM algorithms in detail. Furthermore, several\nadditional facial attribute related issues are introduced, as well as relevant\nreal-world applications. Finally, we discuss possible challenges and promising\nfuture research directions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Dec 2018 09:24:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Mar 2019 06:58:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 27 Oct 2019 03:13:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-29"}

Furthermore, the phenomena can be understood in terms of the\nholography of the boundary system. In this paper, we generalize this four\ndimensional effect to six dimensions. We use the AdS/BCFT holography to show\nthat in the presence of a 3-form magnetic field strength $H$,a string current\nis induced in a six dimensional boundary conformal field theory.

Interparticle potentials, $U(r)$, are extracted from radial\ndistribution functions [$g(r)$, measured by fluorescence microscopy] via\nOrnstein-Zernike inversion and via a reverse Monte Carlo scheme. The results\nare then validated by particle tracking in a blinking optical trap. Using a\nBayesian model comparison, we find that our PMMA-PLMA data is better described\nby a screened monopole only rather than a functional form having a screened\nmonopole plus an unscreened dipole term. We postulate that the long range\nrepulsion we observe arises mainly through interactions between neutral holes\non a charged interface, i.e., the charge of the liquid interface cannot, in\ngeneral, be ignored. In agreement with this interpretation, we find that the\ninteraction can be tuned by varying salt concentration in the aqueous phase.\nInspired by recent theoretical work on point charges at dielectric interfaces,\nwhich we explain is relevant here, we show that a screened $\\frac{1}{r^2}$ term\ncan also be used to fit our data.

Generally, features\ndirectly extracted from a single frame suffer from occlusion, blur,\nillumination and posture changes. This leads to false activation or missing\nactivation in some regions, which corrupts the appearance and motion\nrepresentation. How to explore the abundant spatial-temporal information in\nvideo sequences is the key to solve this problem. To this end, we propose a\nRefining Recurrent Unit (RRU) that recovers the missing parts and suppresses\nnoisy parts of the current frame's features by referring historical frames.\nWith RRU, the quality of each frame's appearance representation is improved.\nThen we use the Spatial-Temporal clues Integration Module (STIM) to mine the\nspatial-temporal information from those upgraded features. Meanwhile, the\nmulti-level training objective is used to enhance the capability of RRU and\nSTIM. Through the cooperation of those modules, the spatial and temporal\nfeatures mutually promote each other and the final spatial-temporal feature\nrepresentation is more discriminative and robust.

In the covert communication, the level of\ntransmit power is low and hence a source with multiple antennas can be adopted\nto send the information toward the single antenna destination while\nconcurrently, the jammer transmits an artificial noise signal. For this system\nmodel, we consider a scenario where the source is forced to select one or\nseveral of its antennas to transmit its confidential information due to its\nlimited RF chains. Furthermore, we consider two different jamming scenarios to\nsupport our covert communication: 1) The destination is unable to cancel the\njamming signal, 2) The destination can subtract the jamming signal. For such a\ncommunication network, our aim is to maximize the covert rate subject to power\nconstraint and covert communication requirement. In the first scenario, the\noptimization problem is non-convex, and hence, it can be solved through using\nDifference of Convex function (DC) method while the optimization problem of the\nsecond scenario is intrinsically convex.

However, these\nnon-visual words can be easily predicted using natural language model without\nconsidering visual signals or attention. Imposing attention mechanism on\nnon-visual words could mislead and decrease the overall performance of visual\ncaptioning. Furthermore, the hierarchy of LSTMs enables more complex\nrepresentation of visual data, capturing information at different scales.

The\nprojected loss-function enables training on labels with just a few annotated\npixels and has no issue with the other unknown label pixels. Training uses all\ndata without reserving some for validation. Only the labels are split into\ntraining/testing. Contrary to other work on horizon tracking, we train the\nnetwork to perform non-linear regression, and not classification. As such, we\npropose labels as the convolution of a Gaussian kernel and the known horizon\nlocations that indicate uncertainty in the labels. The network output is the\nprobability of the horizon location. We demonstrate the proposed computational\ningredients on two different datasets, for horizon extrapolation and\ninterpolation. We show that the predictions of our methodology are accurate\neven in areas far from known horizon locations because our learning strategy\nexploits all data in large seismic images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Dec 2018 07:35:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-31"}

In the domain of robotic locomotion, deep RL could enable\nlearning locomotion skills with minimal engineering and without an explicit\nmodel of the robot dynamics. Unfortunately, applying deep RL to real-world\nrobotic tasks is exceptionally difficult, primarily due to poor sample\ncomplexity and sensitivity to hyperparameters. While hyperparameters can be\neasily tuned in simulated domains, tuning may be prohibitively expensive on\nphysical systems, such as legged robots, that can be damaged through extensive\ntrial-and-error learning. In this paper, we propose a sample-efficient deep RL\nalgorithm based on maximum entropy RL that requires minimal per-task tuning and\nonly a modest number of trials to learn neural network policies. We apply this\nmethod to learning walking gaits on a real-world Minitaur robot. Our method can\nacquire a stable gait from scratch directly in the real world in about two\nhours, without relying on any model or simulation, and the resulting policy is\nrobust to moderate variations in the environment. We further show that our\nalgorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on simulated benchmarks with a\nsingle set of hyperparameters.

One of the proposed methods to\nachieve both goals for subway service is to implement real time train arriving\ncountdown clocks in subway stations. Metropolitan Transportation Authority\n(MTA) of New York City (NYC) chose to install such countdown clocks in their\nstations starting from 2007 on a selection of subway lines. Due to the recent\ndevelopment of Bluetooth Beacon technology, the MTA could now install countdown\nclocks and train trackers in a non intrusive manner with much faster speed. As\na result, the MTA is aiming to install countdown clocks in every subway station\non every line. However, with such an aggressive plan, the impact of countdown\nclocks on subway ridership has not been fully studied. This paper proposes\nusing Panel Regression methods, specifically, Random Effect (RE) model and\nFixed Effect (FE) model to quantify the impact of countdown clocks on subway\nridership. Machine Learning methods, namely Random Forest (RF) with AdaBoost\nand Decision Tree (DT) Regression, are also used as alternative data driven\napproaches for the FE and RE model. The results show that for the G line\nservice, which runs between Brooklyn and Queens, the introduction of countdown\nclocks could increase weekly ridership by about 1783 per station. The study\nalso found that the machine learning methods provide better accuracy in\npredicting the ridership than RE and FE models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Dec 2018 15:59:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-04"}

The Aristotle's mistake, Galileo-Newton progress, Einstein\nphysical geometry established the fundamental role of the spacetime geometry in\nthe motion of fields and bodies. Quantum theory poses a new question about the\nmotion of the quantum states and its reason in the quantum state space. The\nstandard approach of quantum theory uses so-called method of the classical\nanalogy where the action functional contains in the additive manner three\nterms: matter (free particles) + free fields + interaction term. Such approach\nleads to the quantum state space as some space of functions defined on the\nspacetime. I think if one try to understand the peculiarity of the\nself-interacting quantum particles together with its \"field shell\" then the\nclassical scheme should be replaced. Then the role of the spacetime should be\nrevised: the space of the unlocated pure quantum degrees of freedom and its\ngeometry will play the fundamental role and the local dynamical spacetime\narises as representation of the internal quantum motions (inverse\nrepresentation).\n  I will discuss in this work a small but important change in the formulation\nof the field equations for the energy-momentum, orbital momentum and kinetic\nmomentum of the self-interacting electron.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Dec 2018 10:27:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-10"}
