Since a neural network\nefficiently learns data distribution, a network is likely to learn the bias\ninformation to categorize input data. It leads to poor performance at test\ntime, if the bias is, in fact, irrelevant to the categorization. In this paper,\nwe formulate a regularization loss based on mutual information between feature\nembedding and bias. Based on the idea of minimizing this mutual information, we\npropose an iterative algorithm to unlearn the bias information. We employ an\nadditional network to predict the bias distribution and train the network\nadversarially against the feature embedding network. At the end of learning,\nthe bias prediction network is not able to predict the bias not because it is\npoorly trained, but because the feature embedding network successfully unlearns\nthe bias information. We also demonstrate quantitative and qualitative\nexperimental results which show that our algorithm effectively removes the bias\ninformation from feature embedding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Dec 2018 16:01:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Apr 2019 08:42:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-16"}

Both models consist of\nsystems of economical agents located on a finite connected graph representing a\nsocial network. Each agent is characterized by the number of coins she has,\nwhich can be negative in case she is in debt, and each monetary transaction\nconsists in one coin moving from one agent to one of her neighbors. In the\nfirst model, that we name the model with individual debt limit, the agents are\nallowed to individually borrow up to a fixed number of coins. In the second\nmodel, that we name the model with collective debt limit, agents can borrow\ncoins from a central bank as long as the bank is not empty, with reimbursements\noccurring each time an agent in debt receives a coin. Based on numerical\nsimulations of the models on complete graphs, it was conjectured that, in the\nlarge population/temperature limits, the distribution of money converges to a\nshifted exponential distribution for the model with individual debt limit, and\nto an asymmetric Laplace distribution for the model with collective debt limit.\nIn this paper, we prove exact formulas for the distribution of money that are\nvalid for all possible social networks. Taking the large population/temperature\nlimits in the formula found for the model with individual debt limit, we prove\nconvergence to the shifted exponential distribution, thus establishing the\nfirst conjecture. Simplifying the formula found for the model with collective\ndebt limit is more complicated, but using a computer to plot this formula shows\nan almost perfect fit with the Laplace distribution, which strongly supports\nthe second conjecture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Dec 2018 16:15:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-02"}

The Liouvillian gap and the transition\npoint are obtained in closed form in the case where the spin chain is critical.\nWe also obtain the explicit expression for the autocorrelator of the edge spin.\nThe result implies the suppression of decoherence when the spin chain is in the\ntopological regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Dec 2018 16:59:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Jan 2019 14:28:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 13 May 2019 06:24:57 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 15 Apr 2023 08:31:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-18"}

Analytical studies to date have been limited to the weak\nspin injection assumption whereby the equation of motion for the magnetization\nis mapped to hydrodynamic equations describing spin flow and then linearized.\nHere, we analytically and numerically study easy-plane ferromagnetic channels\nsubject to spin injection of arbitrary strength at one extremum under a unified\nhydrodynamic framework. We find that DEFs generally exhibit a nonlinear profile\nalong the channel accompanied by a nonlinear frequency tuneability.

How many faces of dimension $\\frac{d}{2}$ or higher can it\nhave? How dense can they be?\n  This basic question goes back to Descartes' \"Lost Theorem\" and Euler's work\non polyhedra. Using it and other fundamental combinatorial problems, we\nintroduce a version of the K\\\"ahler package beyond positivity, allowing us to\nprove the hard Lefschetz theorem for toric varieties (and beyond) even when the\nample cone is empty. A particular focus lies on replacing the Hodge-Riemann\nrelations by a non-degeneracy relation at torus-invariant subspaces, allowing\nus to state and prove a generalization of theorems of Hall and Laman in the\nsetting of toric varieties and, more generally, the face rings of Hochster,\nReisner and Stanley. This has several applications:\n  - We fully characterize the possible face numbers of simplicial rational\nhomology spheres, resolving the $g$-conjecture of McMullen in full generality\nand generalizing Stanley's earlier proof for simplicial polytopes.

This generalizes a\nresult going back to Descartes and Euler, and resolves the\nGr\\\"unbaum-Kalai-Sarkaria conjecture. We obtain from this a generalization of\nthe celebrated crossing lemma: For a map of a simplicial complex $\\Delta$ into\n$\\mathbb{R}^{2d}$, the number of pairwise intersections of $d$-simplices is at\nleast \\[\\frac{f_d^{d+2}(\\Delta)}{(d+3)^{d+2}f_{d-1}^{d+1}(\\Delta)}\\] provided\n$f_d(\\Delta)> (d+3)f_{d-1}(\\Delta)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Dec 2018 18:39:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2019 20:53:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 10 Jun 2019 17:44:35 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2019 16:20:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-03"}

If the optimal survey strategy is\nadopted, 202 of the GW170817-like kNe and 56 of the BNS population model kNe\nare detected with LSST but are below the threshold for detection by the ALV\nnetwork.

Since the impact was energetic, the disk\nwould have been hot and partially vaporized. This formation process is thought\nto be responsible for the geochemical observation that the Moon is depleted in\nvolatiles. This model predicts that the Moon should be significantly depleted\nin water as well, but this appears to contradict some of the recently measured\nlunar water abundances and D/H ratios that suggest that the Moon is more\nwater-rich than previously thought. Alternatively, the Moon could have retained\nits water if the upper of the disk were dominated by heavier species because\nhydrogen would have had to diffuse out from the heavy-element rich disk, and\ntherefore the escape rate would have been limited by this slow diffusion\nprocess (diffusion-limited escape). To identify which escape the disk would\nhave experienced and to quantify volatiles loss from the disk, we compute the\nthermal structure of the Moon-forming disk considering various bulk water\nabundances and mid-plane disk temperatures. Our calculations show that the\nupper parts of the Moon-forming disk are dominated by heavy atoms or molecules\nand hydrogen is a minor species. This indicates that hydrogen escape would have\nbeen diffusion-limited, and therefore the amount of lost water and hydrogen\nwould have been small compared to the initial abundance assumed. This result\nindicates that the giant impact hypothesis can be consistent with the\nwater-rich Moon. Furthermore, since the hydrogen wind would have been weak, the\nother volatiles would not have escaped either. Thus, the observed volatile\ndepletion of the Moon requires another mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Dec 2018 19:04:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-31"}

Therefore, a robust and new system\nis required to check the information authenticity within the network, to stop\nthe propagation of misinformation. In this paper, we propose a blockchain based\nframework for sharing the information securely at the peer level. In the\nblockchain model, a chain is created by combining blocks of information. Each\nnode of network propagates the information based on its credibility to its peer\nnodes. The credibility of a node will vary according to the respective\ninformation. Trust is calculated between sender and receiver in two ways:(i)\nLocal trust used for sharing information at the peer level and (ii) global\ntrust is used for a credibility check of each user in the network. We evaluate\nour framework using real dataset derived from Facebook. Our approach achieves\nan accuracy of 83% which shows the effectiveness of our proposed framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Dec 2018 19:31:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-31"}

Second, as in real-world settings, our setup has a\nlong-tail distribution, an aspect which has mostly been ignored in the LLL\ncontext.

To avoid model\nsize growing over time and to optimally exploit the semantic relations and\nstructure, we combine it with a visual semantic embedding instead of discrete\nclass labels.

In\naddition, each work proposes its own mathematical formulation, which makes the\ncomparison among different methods difficult. Therefore, this review is\nintended to provide an overall landscape of more than 100 papers on adversarial\nattack and defense strategies for graph data, and establish a unified\nformulation encompassing most graph adversarial learning models. Moreover, we\nalso compare different graph attacks and defenses along with their\ncontributions and limitations, as well as summarize the evaluation metrics,\ndatasets and future trends. We hope this survey can help fill the gap in the\nliterature and facilitate further development of this promising new field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Dec 2018 20:27:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2020 03:49:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2020 22:11:52 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2022 07:19:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-07"}

However, the popular way of\ncapturing light field (LF) via a plenoptic camera presents spatio-angular\nresolution trade-off. Computational imaging techniques such as compressive\nlight field and programmable coded aperture reconstruct full sensor resolution\nLF from coded projections obtained by multiplexing the incoming spatio-angular\nlight field. Here, we present a unified learning framework that can reconstruct\nLF from a variety of multiplexing schemes with minimal number of coded images\nas input. We consider three light field capture schemes: heterodyne capture\nscheme with code placed near the sensor, coded aperture scheme with code at the\ncamera aperture and finally the dual exposure scheme of capturing a\nfocus-defocus pair where there is no explicit coding. Our algorithm consists of\nthree stages 1) we recover the all-in-focus image from the coded image 2) we\nestimate the disparity maps for all the LF views from the coded image and the\nall-in-focus image, 3) we then render the LF by warping the all-in-focus image\nusing disparity maps and refine it. For these three stages we propose three\ndeep neural networks - ViewNet, DispairtyNet and RefineNet. Our reconstructions\nshow that our learning algorithm achieves state-of-the-art results for all the\nthree multiplexing schemes. Especially, our LF reconstructions from\nfocus-defocus pair is comparable to other learning-based view synthesis\napproaches from multiple images.

This creates a non-trivial\nmaterial-selection problem, spanning a continuum of three sets of compositions\n(one for each sub lattice), and requiring control of phase-separation or\nordering in each alloyed subfield.

A number of trends are observed for A-site as well as for B-site\nalloys. To understand the physical reasons that control these trends we\ndecompose the alloy properties into distinct physical terms: (i) the energies\nassociated with removing the octahedral deformations (tilting, rotations, B\nsite displacements), (ii) the energies of compressing the larger component and\nexpanding the smaller one to the alloy volume, (iii) the charge transfer\nenergies associated with placing the alloyed units onto a common lattice, and\nfinally, (iv) structural relaxation of all bonds within the cells., This\nanalysis clarifies the origin of the observed trends in bang gaps,\ndecomposition energies and mixing enthalpies.

For this purpose convolutional sparse coding has\nbeen introduced, where a shift-invariant dictionary is used and the sparsity of\nthe recovered image is maintained. Most such strategies target the $\\ell_0$\n\"norm\" or the $\\ell_1$ norm of the whole image, which may create an imbalanced\nsparsity across various regions in the image.

An effective 3D motion representation and a powerful learning model are\ntwo key factors influencing recognition performance. In this paper we introduce\na new skeleton-based representation for 3D action recognition in videos. The\nkey idea of the proposed representation is to transform 3D joint coordinates of\nthe human body carried in skeleton sequences into RGB images via a color\nencoding process. By normalizing the 3D joint coordinates and dividing each\nskeleton frame into five parts, where the joints are concatenated according to\nthe order of their physical connections, the color-coded representation is able\nto represent spatio-temporal evolutions of complex 3D motions, independently of\nthe length of each sequence.

Most practitioners cannot precisely\ncapture the effect of sampling on the quality of their model, and eventually on\ntheir decision-making process during the tuning phase. Moreover, without\nsystematic support for sampling operators, many optimizations and reuse\nopportunities are lost.\n  In this paper, we introduce BlinkML, a system for fast, quality-guaranteed ML\ntraining.

Most of today's databases rely on histograms or samples that\nare periodically refreshed by re-scanning the data as the underlying data\nchanges. Since frequent scans are costly, these statistics are often stale and\nlead to poor selectivity estimates. As an alternative to scans, query-driven\nhistograms have been proposed, which refine the histograms based on the actual\nselectivities of the observed queries. Unfortunately, these approaches are\neither too costly to use in practice---i.e., require an exponential number of\nbuckets---or quickly lose their advantage as they observe more queries.\n  In this paper, we propose a selectivity learning framework, called QuickSel,\nwhich falls into the query-driven paradigm but does not use histograms.\nInstead, it builds an internal model of the underlying data, which can be\nrefined significantly faster (e.g., only 1.9 milliseconds for 300 queries).\nThis fast refinement allows QuickSel to continuously learn from each query and\nyield increasingly more accurate selectivity estimates over time.

Causative attacks, in\nprinciple, target decision-making algorithms to alter their decisions by making\nthem oblivious to specific attacks. Such attacks influence inference algorithms\nby tampering with the mechanism through which the algorithm is provided with\nthe statistical model of the population about which an inferential decision is\nmade. Causative attacks are viable, for instance, by contaminating the\nhistorical or training data, or by compromising an expert who provides the\nmodel. In the presence of causative attacks, the inference algorithms operate\nunder a distorted statistical model for the population from which they collect\ndata samples. This paper introduces specific notions of secure estimation and\nprovides a framework under which secure estimation under causative attacks can\nbe formulated. A central premise underlying the secure estimation framework is\nthat forming secure estimates introduces a new dimension to the estimation\nobjective, which pertains to detecting attacks and isolating the true model.\nSince detection and isolation decisions are imperfect, their inclusion induces\nan inherent coupling between the desired secure estimation objective and the\nauxiliary detection and isolation decisions that need to be formed in\nconjunction with the estimates.

The special case\nof $\\beta=2$ is known as the Bernoulli map, and is exactly solvable. The\nBernoulli map provides a model for pure, unrestrained chaotic (ergodic)\nbehavior: it is the full invariant shift on the Cantor space\n$\\{0,1\\}^{\\omega}$. The beta transformation defines a subshift: iterated on the\nunit interval, it singles out a subspace of the Cantor space, in such a way\nthat it is invariant under the action of the left-shift operator. That is,\nlopping off one bit at a time gives back the same subspace. The beta transform\nseems to capture something basic about the multiplication of two real numbers:\n$\\beta$ and $x$. It offers a window into understanding the nature of\nmultiplication. Iterating on multiplication, one would get $\\beta^{n}x$ - that\nis, exponentiation; although the mod 1 of the beta transform contorts this in\ninteresting ways. The work presented here is a research diary: a pastiche of\nobservations and some shallow insights. One is that chaos seems to be rooted in\nhow the carry bit behaves during multiplication. Another is that one can\nsurgically insert \"islands of stability\" into chaotic (ergodic) systems, and\nhave some fair amount of control over how those islands of stability behave. In\nparticular, one can have islands with, or without a period-doubling \"route to\nchaos\". The eigenvalues of the transfer operator seem to lie on a circle of\nradius $1/\\beta$ in the complex plane. Given that the transfer operator is\npurely real, the appearance of such a quasi-unitary spectrum seems surprising.\nThe spectrum appears to be the limit of a dense set of quasi-cyclotomic\npolynomials, the positive real roots of which include the Golden and silver\nratios, the Pisot numbers, the n-bonnaci (tribonacci, tetranacci, etc.)\nnumbers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Dec 2018 02:13:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Jan 2019 18:43:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-07"}

This particular value of the\nhole content, often termed as the critical hole concentration, has several\nfeatures putative to a quantum critical point (QCP).

Detailed dynamics focused on charge transfer showed\na surface diffusion and enhancement of polarization due to charge transfer from\nthe metal surface caused the selective adsorption. In a real phenomenon, the\nreason why a few anti-corrosion additives are able to protect a metal surface\nis postulated to be due to this selective nature of adsorption onto a newly\nformed metal surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Dec 2018 07:16:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-31"}

The active control of NFRHT is of great interest since it\nprovides a degree of tunability by external means. In this work, a magnetically\ntunable multi-band NFRHT is revealed in a system of two suspended graphene\nsheets at room temperature. It is found that the single-band spectra for B=0\nsplit into multi-band spectra under an external magnetic field. Dual-band\nspectra can be realized for a modest magnetic field (e.g., B=4 T). One band is\ndetermined by intra-band transitions in the classical regime, which undergoes a\nblue shift as the chemical potential increases. Meanwhile, the other band is\ncontributed by inter-Landau-level transitions in the quantum regime, which is\nrobust against the change of chemical potentials. For a strong magnetic field\n(e.g., B=15 T), there is an additional band with the resonant peak appearing at\nnear-zero frequency (microwave regime), stemming from the magneto-plasmon zero\nmodes. The great enhancement of NFRHT at such low frequency has not been found\nin any previous systems yet.

We found candidates from all previously known RXTE\nTBO sources, with pulsations that had been detected at similar frequencies in\nmultiple independent time windows, and discovered TBOs from SAX J1810.8-2658.\nWe could not confirm most previously-reported tentative TBO detections or\nidentify any obvious candidates just below the detection threshold at similar\nfrequencies in multiple bursts. We computed fractional amplitudes of all TBO\ncandidates and placed upper limits on non-detections. Finally, for a few\nsources we noted small excess of candidates with powers comparable to fainter\nTBOs, but appearing in single independent time bins at random frequencies. At\nleast some of these candidates may be noise spikes that appear interesting due\nto selection effects. The potential presence of such candidates calls for extra\ncaution if claiming single-bin TBO detections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Dec 2018 10:26:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Jun 2019 17:38:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-19"}

However, real-world robotic systems\nmust react intelligently to their observations even in unexpected\ncircumstances. This requires a system to reason about its own uncertainty given\nunfamiliar, out-of-distribution observations. Approximate Bayesian approaches\nare commonly used to estimate uncertainty for neural network predictions, but\ncan struggle with out-of-distribution observations. Generative models can in\nprinciple detect out-of-distribution observations as those with a low estimated\ndensity. However, the mere presence of an out-of-distribution input does not by\nitself indicate an unsafe situation. In this paper, we present a method for\nuncertainty-aware robotic perception that combines generative modeling and\nmodel uncertainty to cope with uncertainty stemming from out-of-distribution\nstates. Our method estimates an uncertainty measure about the model's\nprediction, taking into account an explicit (generative) model of the\nobservation distribution to handle out-of-distribution inputs. This is\naccomplished by probabilistically projecting observations onto the training\ndistribution, such that out-of-distribution inputs map to uncertain\nin-distribution observations, which in turn produce uncertain task-related\npredictions, but only if task-relevant parts of the image change. We evaluate\nour method on an action-conditioned collision prediction task with both\nsimulated and real data, and demonstrate that our method of projecting\nout-of-distribution observations improves the performance of four standard\nBayesian and non-Bayesian neural network approaches, offering more favorable\ntrade-offs between the proportion of time a robot can remain autonomous and the\nproportion of impending crashes successfully avoided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Dec 2018 10:36:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-31"}

However, it is for the first time that we\nintroduce an analytical theory of the interaction of gated and ungated plasmons\nin partly gated 2DES. Generally, a finitewidth gate is formed by a metallic\nstrip placed over an infinite plane hosting 2D electrons.

Unexpectedly, this fundamental plasmon mode has\nbeen found to differ substantially from the rest. In fact, it is characterised\nby gapless square root dispersion and represents a hybrid of gated and ungated\nplasmons.

Hence, non-extremal Kerr-de Sitter black holes could\nalso act as accelerators with arbitrarily high center-of-mass energy for\nspinning particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Dec 2018 11:45:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-20"}

We explain this finding\nby taking into consideration the large s-p mixing for RaX and RaY, similar to\nwhat we had done in our previous work using hydrides and fluorides (A. Sunaga\net al., Phys. Rev. A 95, 012502 (2017)). We also discuss the suitability of RaX\nand RaY molecules for eEDM experiments from the viewpoint of their large PDM\nand small polarizing electric field (Epol).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Dec 2018 13:40:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-19"}

The target molecule is represented by a surface mesh, based on its\ncrystal structure. PyGBe is research software for continuum electrostatics,\nwritten in Python with computationally expensive parts accelerated on GPU\nhardware, via PyCUDA. It is also accelerated algorithmically via a treecode\nthat offers O(N log N) computational complexity. These features allow PyGBe to\nhandle problems with half a million boundary elements or more. Using a model\nproblem consisting of an isolated silver nanosphere in an electric field, our\nresults show grid convergence as 1/N, and accurate computation of the\nextinction cross-section as a function of wavelength (compared with an\nanalytical solution). For a model of a sensor-analyte system, consisting of a\nspherical silver nanoparticle and a set of bovine serum albumin (BSA) proteins,\nour results again obtain grid convergence as 1/N (with respect to the\nRichardson extrapolated value). Computing the LSPR response as a function of\nwavelength in the presence of BSA proteins captures a red-shift of 0.5 nm in\nthe resonance frequency due to the presence of the analytes at 1-nm distance.\nThe final result is a sensitivity study of the biosensor model, obtaining the\nshift in resonance frequency for various distances between the proteins and the\nnanoparticle.

We thus analyse the possible\nself-homeomorphisms of reducible 3-manifolds, and use this analysis to produce\nan explicit representative of the fundamental class of the corresponding\nmapping tori.

Although the computation capability of the vehicle is\nlimited, multi-type of edge computing nodes provide heterogeneous resources for\nvehicular services.When offloading the complicated service to the vehicular\nedge computing node, the decision should consider numerous factors.The\noffloading decision work mostly formulate the decision to a resource scheduling\nproblem with single or multiple objective function and some constraints, and\nexplore customized heuristics algorithms. However, offloading multiple data\ndependency tasks in a service is a difficult decision, as an optimal solution\nmust understand the resource requirement, the access network, the user\nmobility, and importantly the data dependency. Inspired by recent advances in\nmachine learning, we propose a knowledge driven (KD) service offloading\ndecision framework for Vehicle of Internet, which provides the optimal policy\ndirectly from the environment. We formulate the offloading decision of\nmulti-task in a service as a long-term planning problem, and explores the\nrecent deep reinforcement learning to obtain the optimal solution. It considers\nthe future data dependency of the following tasks when making decision for a\ncurrent task from the learned offloading knowledge. Moreover, the framework\nsupports the pre-training at the powerful edge computing node and continually\nonline learning when the vehicular service is executed, so that it can adapt\nthe environment changes and learns policy that are sensible in hindsight. The\nsimulation results show that KD service offloading decision converges quickly,\nadapts to different conditions, and outperforms the greedy offloading decision\nalgorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Dec 2018 09:54:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Jan 2020 08:23:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 11 Feb 2020 03:45:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-12"}

A virtual organism has a structure, resembling the\nhardware capabilities, and it runs low-level functions, implementing the\nsoftware requirements. The model is compositional in space (allowing the\nvirtual organisms to aggregate into larger organisms) and in time (allowing the\nvirtual organisms to get composed functionalities). Technically, the virtual\norganisms studied here are in 2D and their structures are described by regular\n2D pattens; adding the time dimension, we conclude the VO model is in 3D. By\nreconfiguration, an organism may change its structure to another structure\nbelonging to the same 2D pattern. We illustrate the VO concept with three\nincreasingly more complex VOs: (1) a tree collector; (2) a feeding cell; and\n(3) a collection of connected feeding cells. We implemented a simulator for\ntree collector organisms and the quantitative results show reconfigurable\nstructures are better suited than fixed structures in dynamically changing\nenvironments. We briefly show how Agapia - a structured parallel, interactive\nprogramming language where dataflow and control flow structures can be freely\nmixed - may be used for getting quick implementations for VO's simulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Dec 2018 06:23:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-16"}

The simplest and environmentally friendly coolant is wet steam\ncontaining small drops of water. In addition, with the help of heated water\nvapour, the filtering elements of collectors are cleaned from sediments of the\nsolid phase (for example, paraffins, gas hydrates and ice floes) on the walls\nof the porous medium. For realistic modeling of the processes of filtration and\nheat and mass transfer during the injection of wet steam into a porous medium,\nit is necessary to investigate the characteristics of the interaction of\nsaturated water vapour with individual through-type pores. In this paper, a\nstudy was carried out through mathematical modelling of the dependence of the\ndiffusion rate of wet water vapour on the pressure difference outside the pore\nthat occurs when water vapour is injected into a porous medium. The\ndependencies of the diffusion rate on the pore cross section, the magnitude of\nvapour adsorption on the pore walls, as well as the effect of water vapour\ntemperature on all these processes were also investigated. Practical interest\nis the study of the influence of the rate of cooling of water vapour on the\ndiffusion rate and the adsorption of water vapour on the wall of the pores.

In order to\ndefine the sensitivity of parameters with respect to the measurement errors, a\nmechanics-based distance between two sets of parameters is introduced. Using\nthis distance function, we assess the reliability of certain parameter\nidentification procedures. The assessment involves introduction of artificial\nnoise to the experimental data; the noise can be both correlated and\nuncorrelated.
