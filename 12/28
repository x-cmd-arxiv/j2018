Using numerical\ngravito-radiation-hydrodynamics and stellar evolution calculations, we\ndemonstrate that, in addition to the known bloating of massive protostars,\nvariable episodic accretion further influences their evolutionary tracks of\nmassive young stellar objects (MYSOs).

However, regardless of the advantages of\nhaving both body pose and shape, SMPL-based solutions have shown difficulties\nto predict 3D bodies accurately. This is mainly due to the unconstrained nature\nof SMPL, which may generate unrealistic body meshes. Because of this,\nregression of SMPL parameters is a difficult task, often addressed with complex\nregularization terms. In this paper we propose to embed SMPL within a deep\nmodel to accurately estimate 3D pose and shape from a still RGB image. We use\nCNN-based 3D joint predictions as an intermediate representation to regress\nSMPL pose and shape parameters. Later, 3D joints are reconstructed again in the\nSMPL output. This module can be seen as an autoencoder where the encoder is a\ndeep neural network and the decoder is SMPL model. We refer to this as SMPL\nreverse (SMPLR). By implementing SMPLR as an encoder-decoder we avoid the need\nof complex constraints on pose and shape. Furthermore, given that in-the-wild\ndatasets usually lack accurate 3D annotations, it is desirable to lift 2D\njoints to 3D without pairing 3D annotations with RGB images. Therefore, we also\npropose a denoising autoencoder (DAE) module between CNN and SMPLR, able to\nlift 2D joints to 3D and partially recover from structured error. We evaluate\nour method on SURREAL and Human3.6M datasets, showing improvement over\nSMPL-based state-of-the-art alternatives by about 4 and 25 millimeters,\nrespectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Dec 2018 16:47:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2019 10:56:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-09"}

This paper presents a future frame\nsemantic segmentation technique for predicting semantic masks of the current\nand future frames in a time-lapsed video. We specifically focus on time-lapsed\nvideos with large temporal displacement to highlight the model's ability to\ncapture large motions in time. We first introduce a unique semantic\nsegmentation prediction dataset with over 120,000 time-lapsed sky-video frames\nand all corresponding semantic masks captured over a span of five years in\nNorth America region. The dataset has immense practical value for cloud cover\nanalysis, which are treated as non-rigid objects of interest. %Here the model\nprovides both semantic segmentation of cloud region and solar irradiance\nemitted from a region from the sky-videos. Next, our proposed recurrent network\narchitecture departs from existing trend of using temporal convolutional\nnetworks (TCN) (or feed-forward networks), by explicitly learning an internal\nrepresentations for the evolution of video content with time. Experimental\nevaluation shows an improvement of mean IoU over TCNs in the segmentation task\nby 10.8% for 10 mins (21% over 60 mins) ahead of time predictions. Further, our\nmodel simultaneously measures both the current and future solar irradiance from\nthe same video frames with a normalized-MAE of 10.5% over two years. These\nresults indicate that recurrent memory networks with attention mechanism are\nable to capture complex advective and diffused flow characteristic of dense\nfluids even with sparse temporal sampling and are more suitable for future\nframe prediction tasks for longer duration videos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Dec 2018 18:17:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-31"}

Recently, DNN testing has been intensively\nstudied to automatically generate adversarial examples, which inject\nsmall-magnitude perturbations into inputs to test DNNs under extreme\nsituations. While existing testing techniques prove to be effective, they\nmostly focus on generating digital adversarial perturbations (particularly for\nautonomous driving), e.g., changing image pixels, which may never happen in\nphysical world. There is a critical missing piece in the literature on\nautonomous driving testing: understanding and exploiting both digital and\nphysical adversarial perturbation generation for impacting steering decisions.\nIn this paper, we present DeepBillboard, a systematic physical-world testing\napproach targeting at a common and practical driving scenario: drive-by\nbillboards. DeepBillboard is capable of generating a robust and resilient\nprintable adversarial billboard, which works under dynamic changing driving\nconditions including viewing angle, distance, and lighting. The objective is to\nmaximize the possibility, degree, and duration of the steering-angle errors of\nan autonomous vehicle driving by the generated adversarial billboard. We have\nextensively evaluated the efficacy and robustness of DeepBillboard through\nconducting both digital and physical-world experiments. Results show that\nDeepBillboard is effective for various steering models and scenes. Furthermore,\nDeepBillboard is sufficiently robust and resilient for generating\nphysical-world adversarial billboard tests for real-world driving under various\nweather conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study\ndemonstrating the possibility of generating realistic and continuous\nphysical-world tests for practical autonomous driving systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Dec 2018 19:55:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-31"}

The second feature is the presence of a non-trivial symplectic form\non the metaparticle phase space, also motivated by string theory [1, 2].\nBecause of its interpretation as a particle model on Born geometry, the\nspace-time on which the metaparticle propagates is ambiguous, with different\nchoices related by what in string theory we would call T-duality.

Here we allow asymmetric charge patterns on the pore\nwall (positive/negative/neutral along the pore), thus, gaining an additional\ndevice function, rectification, resulting in a dual responsive device. We find\nthat a bipolar nanopore is an efficient geometry with Cl$^{-}$ ions being the\nmain charge carriers.

Also\nthey make the pore less asymmetric and, thus, decrease rectification.

As clearly stated in the original paper by\nNakamoto, the crux of this problem lies in prohibiting any participant from\nengaging in double-spending. There seems to be a common belief that consensus\nis necessary for solving the double-spending problem. Indeed, whether it is for\na permissionless or a permissioned environment, the typical solution uses\nconsensus to build a totally ordered ledger of submitted transfers. In this\npaper we show that this common belief is false: consensus is not needed to\nimplement of a decentralized asset transfer system. We do so by introducing AT2\n(Asynchronous Trustworthy Transfers), a class of consensusless algorithms. To\nshow formally that consensus is unnecessary for asset transfers, we consider\nthis problem first in the shared-memory context. We introduce AT2$_{SM}$, a\nwait-free algorithm that asynchronously implements asset transfer in the\nread-write shared-memory model. In other words, we show that the consensus\nnumber of an asset-transfer object is one. In the message passing model with\nByzantine faults, we introduce a generic asynchronous algorithm called\nAT2$_{MP}$ and discuss two instantiations of this solution. First, AT2$_{D}$\nensures deterministic guarantees and consequently targets a small scale\ndeployment (tens to hundreds of nodes), typically for a permissioned\nenvironment. Second, AT2$_{P}$ provides probabilistic guarantees and scales\nwell to a very large system size (tens of thousands of nodes), ensuring\nlogarithmic latency and communication complexity.

This is\ntypically achieved by the seller having friends bid in her auctions, or the\nseller controls multiple fake bidder accounts that are used for the sole\npurpose of shill bidding. We previously proposed a reputation system referred\nto as the Shill Score that indicates how likely a bidder is to be engaging in\nprice inflating behaviour with regard to a specific seller's auctions. A\npotential bidder can observe the other bidders' Shill Scores, and if they are\nhigh, the bidder can elect not to participate as there is some evidence that\nshill bidding occurs in the seller's auctions. However, if a seller is in\ncollusion with other sellers, or controls multiple seller accounts, she can\nspread the risk between the various sellers and can reduce suspicion on the\nshill bidder. Collusive seller behaviour impacts one of the characteristics of\nshill bidding the Shill Score is examining, therefore collusive behaviour can\nreduce a bidder's Shill Score. This paper extends the Shill Score to detect\nshill bidding where multiple sellers are working in collusion with each other.\nWe propose an algorithm that provides evidence of whether groups of sellers are\ncolluding. Based on how tight the association is between the sellers and the\nlevel of apparent shill bidding is occurring in the auctions, each\nparticipating bidder's Shill Score is adjusted appropriately to remove any\nadvantages from seller collusion.

The outburst occurs on the surface of the white dwarf\nwhich accompanies with a late type main-sequence or giant secondary star\ntransferring material onto the white dwarf primary star. They resemble\nclassical novae (CNe) outbursts but only RNe has more than one recorded\noutbursts. RNe play an important role as one of the suspected progenitor\nsystems of Type Ia supernovae (SNe) which are used as primary distance\nindicators in cosmology. Thus, it is important to investigate the outburst type\nof CNe and RNe and finally ascertain the population of objects that might\nultimately be candidates for Type Ia SNe explosions. The proposal that RNe\noccupy a region separated from CNe in an outburst amplitude versus speed class\ndiagram was adopted. Since the low amplitude results from the existence of an\nevolved secondary and/or high mass transfer rate in the quiescent system, RNe\ncandidates should accordingly have low amplitude. We selected 3 preliminary\ntargets including T Pyx, BT Mon and V574 Pup. Their amplitudes are not that low\nbut the lowest amplitude that can be observed with Thai National Telescope\n(TNT). We obtained their magnitudes at quiescence using ULTRASPEC camera on the\n2.4-m TNT.

This is true for T Pyx, whose secondary star has been\nconfirmed its spectroscopy to be a main-sequence star, but not yet confirmed\nfor BT Mon and V574 Pup.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Dec 2018 02:51:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-31"}

The primate\nvisual system solves the problem of image invariance using cascades of neurons\nthat convert images of faces into categorical representations of facial\nidentity. Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) also create generalizable\nface representations, but with cascades of simulated neurons. DCNN\nrepresentations can be examined in a multidimensional \"face space\", with\nidentities and image parameters quantified via their projections onto the axes\nthat define the space.

Natural\nimage variation is accommodated in this hierarchy, with face identity nested\nunder gender, illumination nested under identity, and viewpoint nested under\nillumination.

Most studies have\nconsidered the frequency as sole interestingness measure for identifying high\nquality patterns. However, each object is different in nature. The relative\nimportance of objects is not equal, in terms of criteria such as the utility,\nrisk, or interest. Besides, another limitation of frequent patterns is that\nthey generally have a low occupancy, i.e., they often represent small sets of\nitems in transactions containing many items, and thus may not be truly\nrepresentative of these transactions. To extract high quality patterns in real\nlife applications, this paper extends the occupancy measure to also assess the\nutility of patterns in transaction databases. We propose an efficient algorithm\nnamed High Utility Occupancy Pattern Mining (HUOPM). It considers user\npreferences in terms of frequency, utility, and occupancy. A novel\nFrequency-Utility tree (FU-tree) and two compact data structures, called the\nutility-occupancy list and FU-table, are designed to provide global and partial\ndownward closure properties for pruning the search space. The proposed method\ncan efficiently discover the complete set of high quality patterns without\ncandidate generation. Extensive experiments have been conducted on several\ndatasets to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed\nalgorithm.

The resulting partial differential equations that govern the change in\nthe shape of a nucleus subject to mass loss and consequent collapse of depleted\nsubsurface structures are solved analytically for simple insolation\nconfigurations and numerically for more realistic scenarios.\n  Results. The here proposed mechanism is capable of explaining why a large\nfraction of periodic comets appear to have peanut-shaped cores and why\nlight-curve amplitudes of comet nuclei are on average larger than those of\ntypical main belt asteroids of the same size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Dec 2018 08:58:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-30"}

Such instabilities have been extensively studied\nin the context of gravitational wave detectors, and their presence has recently\nbeen reported in Advanced LIGO. Here, we observe experimentally and describe\ntheoretically a new type of optomechanical instability that arises in two-tone\nbackaction-evading (BAE) measurements, designed to overcome the standard\nquantum limit, and demonstrate the effect in the optical domain with a photonic\ncrystal nanobeam, and in the microwave domain with a micromechanical oscillator\ncoupled to a microwave resonator. In contrast to the well-known oscillatory\nparametric instability that occurs in single-tone, blue-detuned pumping, which\nis characterized by a vanishing effective mechanical damping, the parametric\ninstability in balanced two-tone optomechanics is exponential, and is a result\nof small detuning errors in the two pump frequencies. Its origin can be\nunderstood in a rotating frame as the vanishing of the effective mechanical\nfrequency due to an optical spring effect. Counterintuitively, the instability\noccurs even in the presence of perfectly balanced intracavity fields, and can\noccur for both signs of detuning. We find excellent quantitative agreement with\nour theoretical predictions. Since the constraints on tuning accuracy become\nstricter with increasing probe power, it imposes a fundamental limitation on\nBAE measurements, as well as other two-tone schemes. In addition to introducing\na new limitation in two-tone BAE measurements, the results also introduce a new\ntype of nonlinear dynamics in cavity optomechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Dec 2018 15:09:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Dec 2018 12:44:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2019 15:59:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-14"}

In this article,\nwe present a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach to address this\nchallenge. By learning the blockage pattern, the system dynamics can be\ncaptured and predicted, resulting in efficient utilization of backhaul\nresource. We begin with a discussion on DRL and its application in wireless\nsystems. We then investigate the problem backhaul resource allocation and\npresent the DRL based solution. Finally, we discuss open problems for future\nresearch and conclude this article.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Dec 2018 18:48:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-19"}

Both thermostatistical formalisms are very successful when\nused in several complex astrophysical statistical systems and we have\ndemonstrated here that they work also in Saha's ionization distribution.

In the following, it is pointed out that their\nconclusion of one of three common-sense conditions, demanded for Quantum\nMechanics, being inevitably and permanently violated is not inevitable; there\nis a way out. Here, it is argued for fully accepting encompassing\ncomplementarity and for a basic conceptualization of quantum mechanics, in\nwhich different aspects are exhibited under different circumstances. The\nreported result is taken as an indication of a fundamental arrow of time\npointing in the direction from the quantum --> classical domain. With the\norigin of thermodynamic time at that interface, its unrestricted applicability\nin isolated quantum systems is questioned. The bold proposal is that TIME as we\nknow it just does not exist at the quantum level. Time instead commences\ntogether with causality at all interfaces to the classic domain whenever a\nminimum amount of energy is transferred in an uncontrolled manner, i.e.,\nwithout well-balanced compensation. Insisting on fully comprehensive\nself-consistency opens new perspectives on (retro-)causality and also on an\ninflation phase at the beginnings of our universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Dec 2018 08:25:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Jan 2019 06:53:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 22 Mar 2019 12:20:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2019 07:12:40 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2020 14:09:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-23"}

Assuming traveler behavior is in\naccordance with the principle of utility maximization, we first formulate a\nbaseline dynamical model for traveler's expected future trip sequence under the\nframework of Markov decision processes and from which we derive approximations\nof the optimal coupon redemption policy. However, we find that this baseline\nmodel cannot explain perfectly observed coupon redemption behavior of traveler\nfor a car-sharing service. To resolve this deviation from utility-maximizing\nbehavior, we suggest a hypothesis that travelers may not be aware of all\ncoupons available to them. Based on this hypothesis, we formulate an\ninattention model on unawareness, which is complementary to the existing models\nof inattention, and incorporate it into the baseline model. Estimation results\nshow that the proposed model better explains the coupon redemption dataset than\nthe baseline model. We also conduct a simulation experiment to quantify the\nnegative impact of unawareness on coupons' promotional effects. These results\ncan be used by mobility service operators to design effective coupon\ndistribution schemes in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Dec 2018 13:10:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-17"}
