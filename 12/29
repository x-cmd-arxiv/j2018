The prior health\ninsurance authorization process postpones the PAC discharge disposition,\nincreases the inpatient length of stay, and effects patient health. Our study\nimplements predictive analytics for the early prediction of the PAC discharge\ndisposition to reduce the deferments caused by prior health insurance\nauthorization, the inpatient length of stay and inpatient stay expenses.\nMethodology: We conducted a group discussion involving 25 patient care\nfacilitators (PCFs) and two registered nurses (RNs) and retrieved 1600 patient\ndata records from the initial nursing assessment and discharge notes to conduct\na retrospective analysis of PAC discharge dispositions using predictive\nanalytics. Results: The chi-squared automatic interaction detector (CHAID)\nalgorithm enabled the early prediction of the PAC discharge disposition,\naccelerated the prior health insurance process, decreased the inpatient length\nof stay by an average of 22.22%, and reduced inpatient stay expenses by \\$1,974\nfor state government hospitals, \\$2,346 for non-profit hospitals and \\$1,798\nfor for-profit hospitals per day. The CHAID algorithm produced an overall\naccuracy of 84.16% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic\n(ROC) curve value of 0.81.

However, in practice, we often have limited data on the true\npredictive task of interest, and must instead rely on more abundant data on a\nclosely-related proxy predictive task. For example, e-commerce platforms use\nabundant customer click data (proxy) to make product recommendations rather\nthan the relatively sparse customer purchase data (true outcome of interest);\nalternatively, hospitals often rely on medical risk scores trained on a\ndifferent patient population (proxy) rather than their own patient population\n(true cohort of interest) to assign interventions. Yet, not accounting for the\nbias in the proxy can lead to sub-optimal decisions. Using real datasets, we\nfind that this bias can often be captured by a sparse function of the features.\nThus, we propose a novel two-step estimator that uses techniques from\nhigh-dimensional statistics to efficiently combine a large amount of proxy data\nand a small amount of true data.

First, we\nutilize a texture-based gradient to accomplish salt dome detection. We show\nthat by employing a dissimilarity measure based on two-dimensional (2D)\ndiscrete Fourier transform (DFT), the algorithm is capable of efficiently\ndetecting salt dome boundaries with accuracy.

Contrasting with the usual approach to modeling human-nature\ninteractions, which are based on the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model with\nhumans as the predators and nature as the prey, here we address this issue\nusing a discrete-time population dynamics model of ecosystem engineers. The\ngrowth of the population of engineers is modeled by the Beverton-Holt equation\nwith a density-dependent carrying capacity that is proportional to the number\nof usable habitats. These habitats (e.g., farms) are the products of the work\nof the individuals on the virgin habitats (e.g., native forests), hence the\ndenomination engineers of ecosystems to those agents. The human-made habitats\ndecay into degraded habitats, which eventually regenerate into virgin habitats.\nFor slow regeneration resources, we find that the dynamics is dominated by\ncycles of prosperity and collapse, in which the population reaches vanishing\nsmall densities. However, increase of the efficiency of the engineers to\nexplore the resources eliminates the dangerous cyclical patterns of feast and\nfamine and leads to a stable equilibrium that balances population growth and\nresource availability. This finding supports the viewpoint of growth optimists\nthat technological progress may avoid collapse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Dec 2018 17:14:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-26"}

The bias-variance trade-off implies that a model\nshould balance under-fitting and over-fitting: rich enough to express\nunderlying structure in data, simple enough to avoid fitting spurious patterns.\nHowever, in the modern practice, very rich models such as neural networks are\ntrained to exactly fit (i.e., interpolate) the data. Classically, such models\nwould be considered over-fit, and yet they often obtain high accuracy on test\ndata. This apparent contradiction has raised questions about the mathematical\nfoundations of machine learning and their relevance to practitioners.\n  In this paper, we reconcile the classical understanding and the modern\npractice within a unified performance curve. This \"double descent\" curve\nsubsumes the textbook U-shaped bias-variance trade-off curve by showing how\nincreasing model capacity beyond the point of interpolation results in improved\nperformance.

These models have only been studied separately in\nthe past. Together, they form a simple extension of the Standard Model that can\naccount for dark matter and explain the existence of neutrino masses, which are\ngenerated radiatively. This holds even if singlet-doublet fermions and triplet\nscalars never contribute simultaneously to the dark matter abundance. However,\nthis also implies the existence of lepton flavour violating processes. In\naddition, this particular model allows for gauge coupling unification. The new\nfields are odd under a new $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry to stabilise the dark matter\ncandidate. We analyse the dark matter, neutrino mass and lepton flavour\nviolation aspects both separately and in conjunction, exploring the viable\nparameter space of the model. This is done using a numerical random scan\nimposing successively the neutrino mass and mixing, relic density, Higgs mass,\ndirect detection, collider and lepton flavour violation constraints. We find\nthat dark matter in this model is fermionic for masses below about 1 TeV and\nscalar above. The narrow mass regions found previously for the two separate\nmodels are enlarged by their coupling. While coannihilations of the weak\nisospin partners are sizeable, this is not the case for fermions and scalars\ndespite their often similar masses due to the relatively small coupling of the\ntwo sectors, imposed by the small neutrino masses. We observe a high degree of\ncomplementarity between direct detection and lepton flavour violation\nexperiments, which should soon allow to fully probe the fermionic dark matter\nsector and at least partially the scalar dark matter sector.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Dec 2018 17:53:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 May 2019 22:47:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-09"}

However, formation of defects is usually observed in\nSM ceramics during manufacturing and/or by mechanical deformation. To fully\ntake advantage of the SM properties of these ceramics, it is necessary to fully\nunderstand the nano-structural evolution of defects under external stimuli. In\nthis study, defect closure behaviors in YSTZ nanopillars are investigated by\natomistic simulations. Two characteristic orientations of [011-] and [001] are\nselected to represent the dominant deformation mechanisms of phase\ntransformation and dislocation migration, respectively. With the presence of\ncrack and void, the strength and yield strain of nanopillars are noted to\ndecrease significantly, especially for [011-]-oriented YSTZ nanopillars. Volume\nexpansion associated with the tetragonal to monoclinic phase transformation is\nobserved to promote healing of crack and void. Atom stress analyses reveal\nstress concentrations along the newly formed monoclinic phase bands. A critical\ncrack width is identified, less than which the crack can be fully closed in\ncompression. Size effect study reveals that an increase in nanopillar size has\na positive effect on crack self-healing behavior. For [001]-oriented YSTZ\nnanopillars, dislocation migration leads to formations of an amorphous phase,\nwhich also assist the crack and void closure process. The revealed crack/void\nhealing mechanisms may provide a path for mitigating internal defects that\ninfluences the mechanical properties and deformation mechanisms of SM ceramics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Dec 2018 18:03:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-31"}

In such a\nscenario the spectrum of light states includes the Majoron, the pseudo-Nambu\nGoldstone boson associated with the breaking of the global symmetry. For a\nbroad range of parameters, the Majoron decays to neutrinos at late times, after\nthe cosmic neutrinos have decoupled from the thermal bath, resulting in a\nsecondary contribution to the cosmic neutrino background. We determine the\ncurrent bounds on this scenario, and explore the possibility of directly\ndetecting this secondary cosmic neutrino background in experiments based on\nneutrino capture on nuclei. For Majoron masses in the eV range or below, the\nneutrino flux from these decays can be comparable to that from the primary\ncosmic neutrino background, making it a promising target for direct detection\nexperiments. The neutrinos from Majoron decay are redshifted by the cosmic\nexpansion, and exhibit a characteristic energy spectrum that depends on both\nthe Majoron mass and its lifetime. For Majoron lifetimes of order the age of\nthe universe or larger, there is also a monochromatic contribution to the\nneutrino flux from Majoron decays in the Milky Way that can be comparable to\nthe diffuse extragalactic flux. We find that for Majoron masses in the eV\nrange, direct detection experiments based on neutrino capture on tritium, such\nas PTOLEMY, will be sensitive to this scenario with 100 gram-years of data.

In the literature two such equations\nhave been suggested: the one by Rutz and the one by one of the authors.

Moreover, to improve\nthe mathematical rigor in the derivation of the Finsler gravity field equation,\nwe formulate the Finsler gravity action on the positive projective tangent\nbundle. This has the advantage of allowing us to apply the classical\nvariational principle, by choosing the domains of integration to be compact and\nindependent of the dynamical variable.

In the present paper, we first extend a previously\nproposed framework to diffusion MRI data for AD classification. Specifically,\nwe add: conversion of diffusion MRI ADNI data into the BIDS standard and\npipelines for diffusion MRI preprocessing and feature extraction. We then apply\nthe framework to compare different components. First, FS has a positive impact\non classification results: highest balanced accuracy (BA) improved from 0.76 to\n0.82 for task CN vs AD. Secondly, voxel-wise features generally gives better\nperformance than regional features. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean\ndiffusivity (MD) provided comparable results for voxel-wise features. Moreover,\nwe observe that the poor performance obtained in tasks involving MCI were\npotentially caused by the small data samples, rather than by the data\nimbalance. Furthermore, no extensive classification difference exists for\ndifferent degree of smoothing and registration methods. Besides, we demonstrate\nthat using non-nested validation of FS leads to unreliable and over-optimistic\nresults: 0.05 up to 0.40 relative increase in BA.

Our primary paradigms for handling decisions under\nuncertainty -- the precautionary principle and optimal control -- have so far\ngiven contradictory results. This paradox is best illustrated in the example of\nfisheries management, where many ideas that guide thinking about ecological\ndecision making were first developed. We find that simplistic optimal control\napproaches have repeatedly concluded that a manager should increase catch\nquotas when faced with greater uncertainty about the fish biomass. Current best\npractices take a more precautionary approach, decreasing catch quotas by a\nfixed amount to account for uncertainty. Using comparisons to both simulated\nand historical catch data, we find that neither approach is sufficient to avoid\nstock collapses under moderate observational uncertainty. Using partially\nobserved Markov decision process (POMDP) methods, we demonstrate how this\nparadox arises from flaws in the standard theory, which contributes to\nover-exploitation of fisheries and increased probability of economic and\necological collapse. In contrast, we find POMDP-based management avoids such\nover-exploitation while also generating higher economic value. These results\nhave significant implications for how we handle uncertainty in both fisheries\nand ecological management more generally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Dec 2018 18:07:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-01"}

Most ice-templating\nstudies utilize upward solidification techniques, where solid ice is located at\nthe bottom of the solidification mold, the liquid suspension is on top of the\nice, and the solidification front advances upward, against gravity. Liquid\nwater reaches its maximum density at 4{\\deg}C; thus, liquid nearest the cold\nsource is less dense than warmer liquid above. The lower density liquid nearest\nthe cold source is expected to rise due to buoyancy, promoting convective fluid\nmotion during solidification. Here, we investigate the effect of solidification\ndirection with respect to the direction of gravity on ice-templated\nmicrostructures to study the role of buoyancy-driven fluid motion during\nsolidification. We hypothesize that, for upward solidification, the convective\nfluid motion that results from a liquid density gradient occurs near the\nsolidification front. For downward solidification, we expect that this fluid\nmotion occurs farther away from the solidification front. Aqueous suspensions\nof TiO2 nanoparticles are solidified upward (against gravity, with ice on\nbottom and water on top), downward (water on bottom, ice on top), and\nhorizontally (perpendicular to gravity). Microstructural investigation of\nsintered samples shows evidence of buoyancy-driven, convective fluid flow\nduring solidification for samples solidified upwards (against gravity),\nincluding tilting of the wall (and pore) orientation with respect to the\ninduced temperature gradient, ice lens defects, and radial macrosegregation.\nThese features are not observed for downward nor horizontal solidification\nconfigurations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Dec 2018 19:12:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-01"}

Furthermore, recent observations and historic data from Galileo\nhint at the occurrence of water vapour eruptions originating from the interior\nthat create 200 km high plumes. Due to the lack of adequate measurements large\nuncertainties exist in the properties of Europa's atmosphere (e.g. loss rate\nand structure) and plumes (e.g. structure, source location, duration), of the\nlatter one the existence is not even confirmed. Unexploited opportunities to\nconstrain properties of the atmosphere or plumes remain in the in-situ data\ncollected by the Galileo mission, the only mission that has surveyed Europa\nfrom close by. In this thesis, I investigate how to constrain the properties\n(density, scale height) of Europa's tenuous atmosphere and plumes, using data\nfrom the Galileo in-situ particle detector instruments (PLS, EPD). I simulate\nthe depletion of energetic protons and oxygen ions measured during the E12\nflyby. A Monte Carlo particle tracing method is used to simulate the particle\ntrajectories and determine where they are depleted: at the surface or in the\natmosphere. The simulations show that the depletions of energetic ions observed\nin the range 80 to 540 keV can be explained by charge exchange with neutral\natmospheric particles, but not by impact on the surface alone. This suggests\nthat an atmosphere must have been present during the E12 flyby.

We\nobserve various emergent planning patterns used to solve environments,\nincluding classical search methods such as breadth-first and depth-first\nsearch. DPN shows improved data efficiency, performance, and generalization to\nnew and unseen domains in comparison to several baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Dec 2018 22:37:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Feb 2019 15:15:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-05"}

In practice, information processing takes place in finite\ntime, resulting in dissipation and potentially unreliable logical outcomes. For\noverdamped Langevin dynamics, we show that counterdiabatic potentials can be\ncrafted to guide systems rapidly and accurately along desired computational\npaths, providing shortcuts that allows for the precise design of finite-time\ncomputations.

The DM surrounds a benchmark model that he or she fears is\nmisspecified by a set of models. Decisions are evaluated under a worst-case\nmodel delivering the lowest utility among all models in this set. The DM's\nbenchmark model and preference parameters are jointly underidentified. With the\nbenchmark model held fixed, primitive conditions are established for\nidentification of the DM's worst-case model and preference parameters. The key\nstep in the identification analysis is to establish existence and uniqueness of\nthe DM's continuation value function allowing for unbounded statespace and\nunbounded utilities. To do so, fixed-point results are derived for monotone,\nconvex operators that act on a Banach space of thin-tailed functions arising\nnaturally from the structure of the continuation value recursion. The\nfixed-point results are quite general; applications to models with learning and\nRust-type dynamic discrete choice models are also discussed. For estimation, a\nperturbation result is derived which provides a necessary and sufficient\ncondition for consistent estimation of continuation values and the worst-case\nmodel. The result also allows convergence rates of estimators to be\ncharacterized. An empirical application studies an endowment economy where the\nDM's benchmark model may be interpreted as an aggregate of experts' forecasting\nmodels.

Another, more\nefficient, mechanism for inflating the ultra-relativistic envelope is an\ninternal shock in the massive ejecta from the merger. A strong shock is\nexpected if the merger product is a magnetar, which emits a centrifugally\naccelerated wind. The shock propagates outward through the ejecta and\naccelerates in its outer layers at radii $r\\sim 10^9-10^{10}$cm, launching an\nultra-relativistic opaque envelope filled with $\\sim 10^4$ photons per nucleon.\nThe Lorentz factor profile of the envelope rises outward and determines its\nhomologous expansion, which adiabatically cools the trapped photons.

To meet the increasing demands for bandwidth-hungry\napplications, access points (APs) are densely deployed and new wireless network\nstandards have been published for higher data rates. Hence, fiber backhaul in\nFiWi access networks is still facing the incoming bandwidth capacity crunch. In\nthis paper, we involve caches in FiWi access networks to cope with fiber\nbackhaul bottleneck and enhance the network throughput. On the other hand,\npower consumption is an important issue in wireless access networks. As both\npower budget in wireless access networks and bandwidth of fiber backhaul are\nconstrained, it is challenging to properly leverage power for caching and that\nfor wireless transmission to achieve optimal system performance. To address\nthis challenge, we formulate the downlink wireless access throughput\nmaximization problem by joint consideration of power allocation and caching\nstrategy in FiWi access networks. To solve the problem, firstly, we propose a\nvolume adjustable backhaul-constrained water-filling method (VABWF) to derive\nthe expression of optimal wireless transmission power allocation.

First, we introduce the idea of translation\ninvariant vectors, which allows us to decompose the search of a 6D rigid\ntransformation into a search of 3D rotation followed by a search of 3D\ntranslation, each of which is solved by a separate BnB algorithm. This\ntransformation decomposition reduces the problem dimensionality of BnB\nalgorithms and substantially improves its efficiency.

To address it, one group tries to exploit mining-based\nstrategies (\\textit{e.g.}, hard example mining and focal loss) to focus on the\ninformative examples. The other group devotes to designing margin-based loss\nfunctions (\\textit{e.g.}, angular, additive and additive angular margins) to\nincrease the feature margin from the perspective of ground truth class. Both of\nthem have been well-verified to learn discriminative features. However, they\nsuffer from either the ambiguity of hard examples or the lack of discriminative\npower of other classes. In this paper, we design a novel loss function, namely\nsupport vector guided softmax loss (SV-Softmax), which adaptively emphasizes\nthe mis-classified points (support vectors) to guide the discriminative\nfeatures learning. So the developed SV-Softmax loss is able to eliminate the\nambiguity of hard examples as well as absorb the discriminative power of other\nclasses, and thus results in more discrimiantive features. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first attempt to inherit the advantages of mining-based\nand margin-based losses into one framework.

Its tunneling current can also be used for the excitation of\nlight, converting electron energy to photon energy. STM based single-molecule\nelectroluminescence can be realized by adopting a combined strategy of both\nefficient electronic decoupling and nanocavity plasmonic enhancement. The\nemission intensity, upon optimized material combination for the molecule,\nspacer, tip, and substrate, can be strong and stable enough for performing\nsecond-order photon correlation measurements. The observation of an evident\nphoton antibunching effect demonstrates clearly the nature of single-photon\nemission for single-molecule electroluminescence. Strikingly, the spectral peak\nof a monomer is found to split when a molecular dimer is artificially\nconstructed through STM manipulation, which suggests that the excitation energy\nfrom tunneling electrons is likely to rapidly delocalize over the whole\nmolecular dimer. The spatial distribution of the excitonic coupling for\ndifferent energy states in a dimer can be visualized in real space through\nsub-nanometer resolved electroluminescence imaging technique, which correlates\nvery well with the local optical responses predicted in terms of coherent\nintermolecular dipole-dipole coupling. Furthermore, a single molecule can also\ncouple coherently with a plasmonic nanocavity, resulting in the occurrence of\ninterference-induced Fano resonance. These findings open up new avenues to\nfabricate electrically driven quantum light sources as well as to study\nintermolecular energy transfer, field-matter interaction, and molecular\noptoelectronics, all at the single-molecule level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Dec 2018 09:18:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-01"}

The relay\nselection algorithm selects non-repeating relays with high link rates for the\nblocked flows, which helps to achieve the QoS requirements of flows as soon as\npossible.

A multi-cation\namorphous oxide (a-IGZO) has been researched extensively and is now being used\nin commercial applications. It is proposed in the literature that overlapping\nIn-5s orbitals form the conduction path and the carrier mobility is limited due\nto the presence of multiple cations which create a potential barrier for the\nelectronic transport in a-IGZO semiconductors. A multi-anion approach towards\namorphous semiconductors has been suggested to overcome this limitation and has\nbeen shown to achieve hall mobilities up to an order of magnitude higher\ncompared to multi-cation amorphous semiconductors. In the present work, we\ncompare the electronic structure and electronic transport in a multi-cation\namorphous semiconductor, a-IGZO and a multi-anion amorphous semiconductor,\na-ZnON using computational methods. Our results show that in a-IGZO, the\ncarrier transport path is through the overlap of outer s-orbitals of mixed\ncations and in a-ZnON, the transport path is formed by the overlap of Zn-4s\norbitals, which is the only type of metal cation present.

Accurate uncertainty propagation\n(estimation of high probabilities or quantiles) and quantitative sensitivity\nanalysis may call for several thousand of code simulations. Complex computer\ncodes, as the ones used in thermal-hydraulic accident scenario simulations, are\noften too cpu-time expensive to be directly used to perform these studies. A\nsolution consists in replacing the computer model by a cpu inexpensive\nmathematical function, called a metamodel, built from a reduced number of code\nsimulations. However, in case of high dimensional experiments (with typically\nseveral tens of inputs), the metamodel building process remains difficult. To\nface this limitation, we propose a methodology which combines several advanced\nstatistical tools: initial space-filling design, screening to identify the\nnon-influential inputs, Gaussian process (Gp) metamodel building with the group\nof influential inputs as explanatory variables. The residual effect of the\ngroup of non-influential inputs is captured by another Gp metamodel.

First, we propose Part Aligned Pooling (PAP)\nthat brings significant improvement for cross-domain testing. Second, we design\na Part Segmentation (PS) constraint over ReID feature to enhance alignment and\nimprove model generalization. Finally, we show that applying our PS constraint\nto unlabeled target domain images serves as effective domain adaptation. We\nconduct extensive experiments between three large datasets, Market1501, CUHK03\nand DukeMTMC-reID. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance under both\nsource-domain and cross-domain settings. For completeness, we also demonstrate\nthe complementarity of our model to existing domain adaptation methods.

This study enriches the literature by giving a first need-driven\ntaxonomy of C-indicators, which is experienced on several use cases. It\nprovides a synthesis and clarification to the emerging and must-needed research\ntheme of C-indicators, and sheds some light on remaining key challenges like\ntheir effective uptake by industry. Eventually, limitations, improvement areas,\nas well as implications of the proposed taxonomy are intently addressed to\nguide future research on C-indicators and CE implementation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Dec 2018 15:11:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-10"}

We present\nthe Localization and Mapping Platform (LAMP) as a modular, contextual and\nradiation detector sensor suite, which performs gamma-ray mapping in three\ndimensions (3-D) and in real time, onboard an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) or\nin a man-portable configuration. The deployment of an unmanned aerial system\n(UAS) for gamma-ray mapping can be advantageous, as the UAS provides a means of\nmeasuring large areas efficiently and improving accessibility to some\nenvironments, such as multi-story structures. In addition, it is possible to\nincrease measurement robustness through autonomous navigation, and to reduce\nradiation exposure to users as a result of the remote measurement. LAMP enables\nmeter-resolution gamma-ray mapping through Scene Data Fusion (SDF) [1], a\ncapability that fuses radiation and scene data via voxelized 3-D Maximum\nLikelihood Expectation Maximization (MLEM) to produce 3-D maps of radioactive\nsource distributions in real-time. Results are computed onboard LAMP while it\nis flying on the UAV and streamed from the system to the user, who can view the\n3-D map on a tablet in real-time. We present results that demonstrate the SDF\nconcept, including a set of UAS flights where a 133Ba source is localized at a\ntest site in Berkeley, CA and a handheld measurement in Fukushima Prefecture,\nJapan where the distribution of radiocesium(137,134Cs) released from the\naccident of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant is mapped. The\nreconstruction parameters used for each measurement were identical, indicating\nthat the same algorithm can be used for both point or distributed sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Dec 2018 22:15:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-17"}

The model extensively covers\ncardiovascular neural pathways including a wide range of afferent sensory\nneurons, central processing by autonomic premotor neurons, efferent outputs via\npreganglionic and postganglionic autonomic neurons and dynamics of\nneurotransmitters at cardiovascular effectors organs. We performed over 500\ncardiovascular experiments using clinical autonomic tests on 72 subjects\nranging from 11 to 82 years old and collected typical cardiovascular signals\nsuch as electrocardiogram, arterial pulse, arterial blood pressure, respiration\npattern, galvanic skin response and skin temperature. After statistical\nevaluation in the time and frequency domains, the data were especially used to\nresolving a constrained optimization task. Results bring evidences supporting\nthe hypothesis that Mayer waves result from a rhythmic sympathetic discharge of\npacemaker-like sympathetic premotor neurons. Simulation also shows that\nvagally-mediated tachycardia, observed during vagal maneuvers on some subjects\ncould be related to the secretion of vasoactive neurotransmitters by the vagal\nnerve. We additionally identified model parameters for estimating the resting\nsympathetic and parasympathetic tone which are believed to be linked to some\npathological states. Results show higher vagal tone on young subjects with a\ndecreasing trend with aging, what agrees with the data from heart rate\nvariability studies. Tonic sympathetic activity was found to possibly emerge\nfrom pacemaker premotor neurons, but also from activation of chemoreceptors to\na lesser extent. The thesis opens perspectives for future work including\nvalidating the markers of autonomic tone provided by our model against data\nfrom experiments with pharmacological blockers and invasive neural activity\nrecordings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Dec 2018 07:19:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Jan 2019 12:59:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-18"}
