The\ntime-dependent evolution of concentrations of the species is commonly described\nby a system of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs). However, the\nanalysis of such high-dimensional, non-linear system of equations is often\ncomputationally expensive and even prohibitive in practice. The major challenge\ntowards reducing such models is providing the guarantees as to how the solution\nof the reduced model relates to that of the original model, while avoiding to\nsolve the original model. In this paper, we have designed and tested an\napproximation method for ODE models of biochemical reaction systems, in which\nthe guarantees are our major requirement. Borrowing from tropical analysis\ntechniques, dominance relations among terms of each species' ODE are exploited\nto simplify the original model, by neglecting the dominated terms. As the\ndominant subsystems can change during the system's dynamics, depending on which\nspecies dominate the others, several possible modes exist. Thus, simpler models\nconsisting of only the dominant subsystems can be assembled into hybrid,\npiecewise smooth models, which approximate the behavior of the initial system.\nBy combining the detection of dominated terms with symbolic bounds propagation,\nwe show how to approximate the original model by an assembly of simpler models,\nconsisting in ordinary differential equations that provide time-dependent lower\nand upper bounds for the concentrations of the initial models species. Our\nmethod provides sound interval bounds for the concentrations of the chemical\nspecies, and hence can serve to evaluate the faithfulness of\ntropicalization-based reduction heuristics for ODE models of biochemical\nreduction systems.

We propose to boost the fronthaul\ncapacity of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) aided C-RAN by\nglobally optimizing the power sharing between channel estimation and data\ntransmission both for the user devices (UDs) and the remote radio units (RRUs).\nIntuitively, allocating more power to the channel estimation will result in\nmore accurate channel estimates, which increases the achievable throughput.\nHowever, increasing the power allocated to the pilot training will reduce the\npower assigned to data transmission, which reduces the achievable throughput.\nIn order to optimize the powers allocated to the pilot training and to the data\ntransmission of both the UDs and the RRUs, we assign an individual power\nsharing factor to each of them and derive an asymptotic closed-form expression\nof the signal-to-interference-plus-noise for the massive MIMO aided C-RAN\nconsisting of both the UD-to-RRU links and the RRU-to-baseband unit (BBU)\nlinks.

By analyzing the stress-strain curves of samples with an\ninitial, axial dislocation density gradient, we arrive at the following\nconclusions: (i) in the regime of quasi-elastic deformation before the onset of\nplastic flow, the effective elastic modulus of the simulated samples falls\nsignificantly below the value for a dislocation-free crystal. This modulus\nreduction increases with decreasing dislocation density gradient: crystals with\nhomogeneous dislocation distribution are thus weakest in the quasi-elastic\nregime; (ii) the transition towards plastic flow occurs first in regions of\nreduced dislocation density. Therefore, the overall yield stress decreases with\nincreasing dislocation density gradient; (iii) crystals with dislocation\ndensity gradient exhibit a more pronounced hardening stage during which stress\nis re-distributed onto stronger regions with higher dislocation density until\nthe sample flows at a constant flow stress that is approximately independent on\ndislocation density gradient. We interpret these findings in terms of a\ncontinuum dislocation dynamics inspired model of dislocation density evolution\nthat accounts for inversive dislocation motions. The transition between\nquasi-elastic and plastic deformation is interpreted as a transition from\ninversive to non-inversive dislocation motion, and the initial differences in\nelastic modulus are related to a density dependent polarizability of the\ndislocation system. The subsequent plastic flow behavior is analyzed in terms\nof a modified version of Mughrabi's composite model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Dec 2018 19:32:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-24"}

However, in the upper thermosphere and\nexosphere, the neutrals are also subject to ion precipitation. This can\nincrease the temperature in the region of precipitation, resulting in density\nchanges that might be seen in in situ data (Fang et al. 2013). Therefore, we\nexamine neutral density data from the MAVEN Neutral Gas and Ion Mass\nSpectrometer (NGIMS) in Mars-Solar-Electric (MSE) coordinates, where location\nis determined by the direction of the solar wind convective electric field,\nresulting in a hemispherical asymmetry in the ion precipitation.

Indeed, the model predicts $U_e\\gg U_B$ and $t_{\\rm cool}\\gg t_{\\rm\ndyn}$ for most of the objects.

In particular, accurate demand forecasts for popular products with\nfrequent repeat purchases are essential since these products are one of the\nmain drivers of profits. However, buyer purchase patterns are extremely diverse\nand sparse on a per-product level due to population heterogeneity as well as\ndependence in purchase patterns across product categories. Traditional methods\nin survival analysis have proven effective in dealing with censored data by\nassuming parametric distributions on inter-arrival times. Distributional\nparameters are then fitted, typically in a regression framework. On the other\nhand, neural-network based models take a non-parametric approach to learn\nrelations from a larger functional class. However, the lack of distributional\nassumptions make it difficult to model partially observed data. In this paper,\nwe model directly the inter-arrival times as well as the partially observed\ninformation at each time step in a survival-based approach using Recurrent\nNeural Networks (RNN) to model purchase times jointly over several products.\nInstead of predicting a point estimate for inter-arrival times, the RNN outputs\nparameters that define a distributional estimate. The loss function is the\nnegative log-likelihood of these parameters given partially observed data. This\napproach allows one to leverage both fully observed data as well as partial\ninformation. By externalizing the censoring problem through a log-likelihood\nloss function, we show that substantial improvements over state-of-the-art\nmachine learning methods can be achieved.

However, in network settings this\nconventional tradeoff must now account for node connectivity. In particular,\nmalicious nodes may exert malicious influence, so that mistakenly leaving some\nof these in the network may cause damage to spread. On the other hand, removing\nbenign nodes causes direct harm to these, and indirect harm to their benign\nneighbors who would wish to communicate with them.\n  We formalize the problem of removing potentially malicious nodes from a\nnetwork under uncertainty through an objective that takes connectivity into\naccount. We show that optimally solving the resulting problem is NP-Hard. We\nthen propose a tractable solution approach based on a convex relaxation of the\nobjective.

Motivated by the\napparent break of spherical symmetry, we propose a very general gedanken\nexperiment that does not rely on any specific theory of classical or quantum\ngravity, and analyze this gedanken experiment in the context of quantum\ninformation. We show that any spin-related deviation from spherical symmetry\nwould violate relativistic causality.

Photonic integration has enabled not only\nminiaturizing photonic components, but also provided performance improvements\ndue to co-design addressing both electrical and optical device rules. However\nthe millimeter-to-centimeter large footprint of many foundry-ready photonic\nelectro-optic modulators significantly limits scaling density. Furthermore,\nmodulators bear a fundamental a frequency-response to energy-sensitive\ntrade-off, a limitation that can be overcome with coupling-based modulators\nwhere the temporal response speed is decoupled from the optical cavity photo\nlifetime. Thus, the coupling effect to the resonator is modulated rather then\ntuning the index of the resonator itself. However, the weak electro-optic\nresponse of silicon limits such coupling modulator performance, since the\nmicrometer-short overlap region of the waveguide-bus and a microring resonator\nis insufficient to induce signal modulation. To address these limitations, here\nwe demonstrate a coupling-controlled electro-optic modulator by heterogeneously\nintegrating a dual-gated indium-tin-oxide (ITO) phase shifter placed at the\nsilicon microring-bus coupler region. Our experimental modulator shows about 4\ndB extinction ratio on resonance, and a about 1.5 dB off resonance with a low\ninsertion loss of 0.15 dB for a just 4 {\\mu}m short device demonstrating a\ncompact high 10:1 modulation-to-loss ratio. In conclusion we demonstrate a\ncoupling modulator using strongly index-changeable materials enabling compact\nand high-performing modulators using semiconductor foundry-near materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Dec 2018 02:55:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-01"}

In-memory acceleration has potential to address this\nproblem; however, it needs to address two challenges. First, in-memory\naccelerator should be general enough to support a large set of different ML\nalgorithms. Second, it should be efficient enough to utilize bandwidth while\nmeeting limited power and area budgets of logic layer of a 3D-stacked memory.\nWe observe that previous work fails to simultaneously address both challenges.\nWe propose ORIGAMI, a heterogeneous set of in-memory accelerators, to support\ncompute demands of different ML algorithms, and also uses an off-the-shelf\ncompute platform (e.g.,FPGA,GPU,TPU,etc.) to utilize bandwidth without\nviolating strict area and power budgets. ORIGAMI offers a pattern-matching\ntechnique to identify similar computation patterns of ML algorithms and\nextracts a compute engine for each pattern. These compute engines constitute\nheterogeneous accelerators integrated on logic layer of a 3D-stacked memory.\nCombination of these compute engines can execute any type of ML algorithms. To\nutilize available bandwidth without violating area and power budgets of logic\nlayer, ORIGAMI comes with a computation-splitting compiler that divides an ML\nalgorithm between in-memory accelerators and an out-of-the-memory platform in a\nbalanced way and with minimum inter-communications. Combination of pattern\nmatching and split execution offers a new design point for acceleration of ML\nalgorithms. Evaluation results across 12 popular ML algorithms show that\nORIGAMI outperforms state-of-the-art accelerator with 3D-stacked memory in\nterms of performance and energy-delay product (EDP) by 1.5x and 29x (up to 1.6x\nand 31x), respectively.

It has been shown earlier that the supersymmetry\npreserving vacuum expectation values (vev's) get mapped to distinct but\ndegenerate set of vev's under action of $D$ parity, leading to formation of\ndomain walls as topological pseudo-defects. The metastability of such walls can\nmake them relatively long lived and contradict standard cosmology. Thus we are\nled to consider adding a nonrenormalisable Planck scale suppressed operator,\nthat breaks $\\mathrm{SO}(10)$ symmetry but preserves Standard Model symmetry.\nFor a large range of right handed breaking scales $M_R$, this is shown to give\nrise to the required pressure difference to remove the domain walls without\nconflicting with consistent big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) while avoiding\ngravitino overproduction. However, if the walls persist till the onset of weak\n(thermal) inflation, then a low $\\sim 10 - 100$ TeV $M_R$ becomes problematic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Dec 2018 06:14:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Aug 2019 14:55:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2020 09:02:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-29"}

To leverage the data and\nresources, a new machine learning paradigm, called edge learning, has emerged\nwhere learning algorithms are deployed at the edge for providing fast and\nintelligent services to mobile users. While computing speeds are advancing\nrapidly, the communication latency is becoming the bottleneck of fast edge\nlearning. To address this issue, this work is focused on designing a low\nlatency multi-access scheme for edge learning. We consider a popular framework,\nfederated edge learning (FEEL), where edge-server and on-device learning are\nsynchronized to train a model without violating user-data privacy. It is\nproposed that model updates simultaneously transmitted by devices over\nbroadband channels should be analog aggregated \"over-the-air\" by exploiting the\nsuperposition property of a multi-access channel. Thereby, \"interference\" is\nharnessed to provide fast implementation of the model aggregation. This results\nin dramatical latency reduction compared with the traditional orthogonal access\n(i.e., OFDMA). In this work, the performance of FEEL is characterized targeting\na single-cell random network. First, due to power alignment between devices as\nrequired for aggregation, a fundamental tradeoff is shown to exist between the\nupdate-reliability and the expected update-truncation ratio. This motivates the\ndesign of an opportunistic scheduling scheme for FEEL that selects devices\nwithin a distance threshold. This scheme is shown using real datasets to yield\nsatisfactory learning performance in the presence of high mobility. Second,\nboth the multi-access latency of the proposed analog aggregation and the OFDMA\nscheme are analyzed. Their ratio, which quantifies the latency reduction of the\nformer, is proved to scale almost linearly with device population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Dec 2018 09:09:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Jan 2019 11:25:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 16 Jan 2019 07:11:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-17"}

Class I events are\nthose for which cancellation happens between a pre-existing large magnetic\nfeature of one polarity and a smaller feature of the other polarity that\nemerged/appeared nearby. For Class II events cancellations occur between two\npre-existing, previously unconnected features that converge toward each other.\nAll studied events have an apparent cancellation time less than 10 minutes and\ndisplay a significant transient linear polarization signal along the polarity\ninversion line. The cancellation events are characterized by a flux decay rate\nof about 10$^{15}$~Mx s$^{-1}$. Horizontal convergence speeds of Class II pairs\nfall between 0.3 and 1.22~km s$^{-1}$. The elements often do not converge\ndirectly towards each other, so that the proper motion speeds of the individual\nelements is higher, in the range of 1 - 2.7~km s$^{-1}$. We propose that these\ncancellation events result from either field-line submergence (Class I), or\nreconnection followed by submergence (Class II and/or Class I). Ohmic\ndissipation of magnetic energy could also play a role for both classes. We\npropose that, at least for the Class II events, the granular motions could\npossibly be driving magnetic reconnection, rather than the supergranular\nmotions proposed for the larger cancellation events studied earlier.

Hyperspectral imaging enables\ndiscrimination between spectrally similar classes but its swath width from\nspace is narrow compared to multispectral ones.

The growth rate of the KBM is found to be\nstrongly dependent on the field line stiffening factor $S$, which depends on\nthe trapped electron dynamics, the finite ion gyroradius, and the magnetic\ndrift motion of charged particles. Furthermore, calculations show that the KBM\nis unstable in a finite intermediate range of equatorial $\\beta_{eq}$ values\nand the growth rate dependence on $\\beta_{eq}$ is enhanced for larger $\\rho_i$.\nThe KBM stability is further analyzed in a broad range of $k_y$ for different\nvalues of ion Larmor radius $\\rho_i$ and gradient ratio $\\eta_j \\equiv\nd\\ln(T_j)/d\\ln(n_j)$, where $T_j$ is the particle temperature and $n_j$ is the\nparticle density.

To deal with a\ndomain that has insufficient labeled data, these approaches can be used in a\nTransfer Learning (TL) setting to leverage labeled data from a resource-rich\nsource domain. To achieve better performance, source domain data selection is\nessential in this process to prevent the \"negative transfer\" problem. However,\nthe emerging deep transfer models do not fit well with most existing data\nselection methods, because the data selection policy and the transfer learning\nmodel are not jointly trained, leading to sub-optimal training efficiency.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel reinforced data selector to select\nhigh-quality source domain data to help the TL model. Specifically, the data\nselector \"acts\" on the source domain data to find a subset for optimization of\nthe TL model, and the performance of the TL model can provide \"rewards\" in turn\nto update the selector. We build the reinforced data selector based on the\nactor-critic framework and integrate it to a DNN based transfer learning model,\nresulting in a Reinforced Transfer Learning (RTL) method. We perform a thorough\nexperimental evaluation on two major tasks for text matching, namely,\nparaphrase identification and natural language inference. Experimental results\nshow the proposed RTL can significantly improve the performance of the TL\nmodel. We further investigate different settings of states, rewards, and policy\noptimization methods to examine the robustness of our method. Last, we conduct\na case study on the selected data and find our method is able to select source\ndomain data whose Wasserstein distance is close to the target domain data. This\nis reasonable and intuitive as such source domain data can provide more\ntransferability power to the model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Dec 2018 15:39:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-01"}

While it is known that defects\nself-organization controls Tc, the mechanism remains an open issue. Here we\nfocus on the theoretical prediction of the multi-band electronic structure and\nthe formation of broken Fermi surfaces generated by the self-organization of\noxygen interstitials O-i atomic wires in the spacer layers in HgBa2CuO4+y,\nLa2CuO4+y and La2NiO4+y, by means of self-consistent Linear Muffin-Tin Orbital\n(LMTO) calculations. The electronic structure of a first phase of ordered O-i\natomic wires and of a second glassy phase made of disordered O-i impurities\nhave been studied through supercell calculations. We show the common features\nof the influence of O-i wires in the electronic structure in three type of\nmaterials. The ordering of O-i into wires lead to a separation of the\nelectronic states between the O-i ensemble and the rest of the bulk. The wires\nformation produce first quantum confined localized states near the wire which\ncoexist with second delocalized states in the Fermi-surface (FS) of doped\ncuprates. In this new scenario for high Tc superconductivity, Kitaev wires with\nMajorana bound states are proximity-coupled to a 2D d-wave superconductor in\ncuprates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Dec 2018 10:09:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-07"}

Two main failure modes to be addressed are an obstruction of the flow\npath of the processing liquid and a deviation from the desired gap distance\nbetween probe and sample. Methods: We introduce a multi-functional design\nelement, a microfluidic bypass channel, which can be operated in dc and in ac\nmode, each preventing one of the two main failure modes. Results: In dc mode,\nthe bypass channel is filled with liquid and exhibits resistive behavior,\nenabling the probe to passively react to an obstruction. In the case of an\nobstruction of the flow path, the processing liquid is passively diverted\nthrough the bypass to prevent its leakage and to limit the build-up of high\npressure levels. In ac mode, the bypass is filled with gas and has capacitive\ncharacteristics, allowing the gap distance between the probe and the sample to\nbe monitored by observing a phase shift in the motion of two gas-liquid\ninterfaces. For a modulation of the input pressure at 4 Hz, significant changes\nof the phase shift were observed up to a gap distance of 25 {\\mu}m. Conclusion:\nThe presented passive design element counters both failure modes in a simple\nand highly compatible manner. Significance: Liquid scanning probes enabling\ntargeted interfacing with biological surfaces are compatible with a wide range\nof workflows and bioanalytical applications. An improved operational robustness\nwould facilitate rapid and widespread adoption of liquid scanning probes in\nresearch as well as in diagnostics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Dec 2018 22:07:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-03"}
