In this work, an inviscid regularization technique called\n'observable regularization' is proposed for the simulation of two-phase\ncompressible flows. The proposed approach regularizes the equations at the\nlevel of the partial differential equation and as a result, any numerical\nmethod can be used to solve the system of equations. The regularization is\naccomplished by introducing an 'observability limit' that represents the length\nscale below which one cannot properly model or continue to resolve flow\nstructures. An observable volume fraction equation is derived for capturing the\nmaterial interface, which satisfies the pressure equilibrium at the interface.\nThe efficacy of the observable regularization method is demonstrated using\nseveral test cases, including a one-dimensional material interface tracking,\none-dimensional shock-tube and shock-bubble problems, and two-dimensional\nsimulations of a shock interacting with a cylindrical bubble. The results show\nfavorable agreement, both qualitatively and quantitatively, with available\nexact solutions or numerical and experimental data from the literature.

The plasticity equations additionally contain\n\"extra\" terms fostering competition between excitatory synapses converging onto\nthe same postsynaptic neuron and inhibitory synapses diverging from the same\npresynaptic neuron. The parameters of competition between S$\\to$E connections\ncan be adjusted to make learned features look more like \"parts\" or \"wholes.\"\nThe parameters of competition between I-E connections can be adjusted to set\nthe typical decorrelatedness and sparsity of E neuron activity. Numerical\nsimulations of unsupervised learning show that relatively few I neurons can be\nsufficient for achieving good decorrelation, and increasing the number of I\nneurons makes decorrelation more complete.

When galaxies merge, their component black\nholes form SMBH binaries (SMBHBs), which emit low-frequency gravitational waves\n(GWs) that can be detected by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). We have searched the\nrecently-released North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves\n(NANOGrav) 11-year data set for GWs from individual SMBHBs in circular orbits.\nAs we did not find strong evidence for GWs in our data, we placed 95\\% upper\nlimits on the strength of GWs from such sources as a function of GW frequency\nand sky location. We placed a sky-averaged upper limit on the GW strain of $h_0\n< 7.3(3) \\times 10^{-15}$ at $f_\\mathrm{gw}= 8$ nHz. We also developed a\ntechnique to determine the significance of a particular signal in each pulsar\nusing ``dropout' parameters as a way of identifying spurious signals in\nmeasurements from individual pulsars. We used our upper limits on the GW strain\nto place lower limits on the distances to individual SMBHBs. At the\nmost-sensitive sky location, we ruled out SMBHBs emitting GWs with\n$f_\\mathrm{gw}= 8$ nHz within 120 Mpc for $\\mathcal{M} = 10^9 \\, M_\\odot$, and\nwithin 5.5 Gpc for $\\mathcal{M} = 10^{10} \\, M_\\odot$.

Finally, we estimated the number of potentially\ndetectable sources given our current strain upper limits based on galaxies in\nTwo Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) and merger rates from the Illustris\ncosmological simulation project. Only 34 out of 75,000 realizations of the\nlocal Universe contained a detectable source, from which we concluded it was\nunsurprising that we did not detect any individual sources given our current\nsensitivity to GWs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Dec 2018 18:39:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 May 2019 23:38:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 21 May 2019 15:34:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-30"}

Most of the existing tools impose restrictions such as\nnot allowing nested intervals or requiring intervals to be sorted when finding\noverlaps in two or more interval sets. We proposed segment tree (ST) and\nindexed segment tree forest (ISTF) based solutions for intersection of multiple\ngenomic interval sets in parallel. We developed these methods as a tool, Joint\nOverlap Analysis (JOA), which takes n interval sets and finds overlapping\nintervals with no constraints on the given intervals.

Second, researchers can\npresent the identified set for the parameter of interest under the assumption\nthat the true model lies somewhere on this frontier. We call this the\nfalsification adaptive set. This set generalizes the standard baseline estimand\nto account for possible falsification. Third, researchers can present the\nidentified set for a specific point on this frontier. Finally, as a sensitivity\nanalysis, researchers can present identified sets for points beyond the\nfrontier. To illustrate these four ways of salvaging falsified models, we study\noveridentifying restrictions in two instrumental variable models: a homogeneous\neffects linear model, and heterogeneous effect models with either binary or\ncontinuous outcomes. In the linear model, we consider the classical\noveridentifying restrictions implied when multiple instruments are observed. We\ngeneralize these conditions by considering continuous relaxations of the\nclassical exclusion restrictions.

Given $n$ independent observations\nfrom a $d$-dimensional log-concave density with $d \\in \\{2,3\\}$, we prove a\nsharp oracle inequality, which in particular implies that the Kullback--Leibler\nrisk of the log-concave maximum likelihood estimator for such densities is\nbounded above by $\\Gamma(f)/n$, up to a polylogarithmic factor.

The requirement of causality implies that the quantum\ngravity wavefunctional $\\Psi$ has an important component not present in the\nsemiclassical picture: virtual fuzzballs. The large mass $M$ of the fuzzballs\nwould suppress their virtual fluctuations, but this suppression is compensated\nby the large number -- $Exp[S_{bek}(M)]$ -- of possible fuzzballs. These\nfuzzballs are extended compression-resistant objects. The presence of these\nobjects in the vacuum wavefunctional alters the physics of collapse when a\nhorizon is about to form; this resolves the information paradox. We argue that\nthese virtual fuzzballs also resist the curving of spacetime, and so cancel out\nthe large cosmological constant created by the vacuum energy of local quantum\nfields. Assuming that the Birkoff theorem holds to leading order, we can map\nthe black hole information problem to a problem in cosmology.

Use of wheels for rolling presents substantial\nchallenges as the wheel can't gain traction to roll.

However, there lacks a systematic\nframework of joint weight pruning and quantization of DNNs, thereby limiting\nthe available model compression ratio. Moreover, the computation reduction,\nenergy efficiency improvement, and hardware performance overhead need to be\naccounted for besides simply model size reduction.\n  To address these limitations, we present ADMM-NN, the first\nalgorithm-hardware co-optimization framework of DNNs using Alternating\nDirection Method of Multipliers (ADMM), a powerful technique to deal with\nnon-convex optimization problems with possibly combinatorial constraints. The\nfirst part of ADMM-NN is a systematic, joint framework of DNN weight pruning\nand quantization using ADMM. It can be understood as a smart regularization\ntechnique with regularization target dynamically updated in each ADMM\niteration, thereby resulting in higher performance in model compression than\nprior work.

In the scalar approximation, the\nangular-frequency transfer function and the point-spread function (Green\nfunction) of the FPI are calculated, which enables to relate the spatial\ncoherence functions of the incident and transmitted radiation and to derive an\nexpression for the output intensity I(r, k) and for the integral transmittance\nP(k) depending on the wavenumber of the incident monochromatic radiation k. In\nthe resulting expressions, I(r, k) is completely determined by the Fourier\ntransform of the input coherence function, and P(k) is determined by the\nangular power spectrum (APS) of the incident radiation. For beams of small\ndivergence and high-quality FPIs, simplified formulas have been obtained that\nallow, in the first approximation, for the dependence of the FPI parameters on\nthe angle of incidence and on the radiation wavelength.

The lack of helium in the majority of our sample demonstrates\nthe complexity of SN Iax progenitor systems and the need for further modeling.\nWith strong independent evidence indicating that SNe Iax arise from a SD\nchannel, we caution the common interpretation that the lack of helium or\nhydrogen emission at late-time in SN Ia spectra rules out SD progenitor\nscenarios for this class.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Dec 2018 04:05:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 May 2019 06:26:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-22"}

As the influence of a player\nover the voting outcome is not in general proportional to her assigned weight,\nvarious power indices have been proposed to measure each player's influence.\nThe inverse power index problem is the problem of designing a weighted voting\ngame that achieves a set of target influences according to a predefined power\nindex.

To achieve scalability across servers in more than 10 countries\nlocated on 4 different continents, we drastically revisited Byzantine fault\ntolerant blockchains and verification of signatures. The resulting blockchain,\ncalled the Red Belly Blockchain (RBBC), commits more than a hundred thousand\ntransactions issued by permissionless nodes. These transactions are grouped\ninto blocks within few seconds through a partially synchronous consensus run by\npermissioned nodes. It prevents double spending by guaranteeing that a unique\nblock is decided at any given index of the chain in a deterministic way by all\nparticipants. We compared the performance of RBBC against traditional Byzantine\nfault tolerant alternatives and more recent randomized solutions. In the same\ngeo-distributed environment with low-end machines, we noticed two interesting\ncomparisons: (i) the RBBC throughput scales to hundreds of machines whereas the\nclassic 3-step leader-based BFT state machine used by consortium blockchains\ncannot scale to 40 identically configured nodes; (ii) RBBC guarantees\ntransaction finality in 3 seconds and experiences a third of the latency that\nrandomized-based solutions like HoneyBadgerBFT can offer. This empirical\nevaluation demonstrates that blockchain scalability can be achieved without\nsacrificing security.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Dec 2018 10:19:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-01"}

Instead,\nedge machine learning becomes increasingly attractive for performing training\nand inference directly at network edges without sending data to a centralized\ndata center. This stimulates a nascent field termed as federated learning for\ntraining a machine learning model on computation, storage, energy and bandwidth\nlimited mobile devices in a distributed manner. To preserve data privacy and\naddress the issues of unbalanced and non-IID data points across different\ndevices, the federated averaging algorithm has been proposed for global model\naggregation by computing the weighted average of locally updated model at each\nselected device. However, the limited communication bandwidth becomes the main\nbottleneck for aggregating the locally computed updates. We thus propose a\nnovel over-the-air computation based approach for fast global model aggregation\nvia exploring the superposition property of a wireless multiple-access channel.\nThis is achieved by joint device selection and beamforming design, which is\nmodeled as a sparse and low-rank optimization problem to support efficient\nalgorithms design. To achieve this goal, we provide a\ndifference-of-convex-functions (DC) representation for the sparse and low-rank\nfunction to enhance sparsity and accurately detect the fixed-rank constraint in\nthe procedure of device selection.

Therefore large neural circuits can either devote connectivity to\ngenerating complex behaviors, or exploit this connectivity to achieve faster\nand more precise learning of simpler behaviors.

In contrast to particle distributions in Euclidean space,\nrestriction that the particles should lie on the sphere brings about several\nimportant constraints. These require a careful extension of quantities used for\nparticle distributions in Euclidean space to those confined to the sphere. We\nintroduce a framework designed to analyze and classify structural (dis)order in\nparticle distributions constrained to the sphere. The classification is based\non the concept of hyperuniformity, which was introduced 15 years ago and since\nthen studied extensively in Euclidean space, yet has only very recently been\nconsidered for the sphere. We build our framework on a generalization of the\nstructure factor on the sphere, which we relate to the power spectrum of the\ncorresponding multipole expansion. The spherical structure factor is then shown\nto couple with cap number variance, a measure of local density fluctuations,\nallowing us to derive different forms of the variance. In this way, we\nconstruct a classification of hyperuniformity for scale-free particle\ndistributions on the sphere and show how it can be extended to other\ndistributions as well. We demonstrate that hyperuniformity on the sphere can be\ndefined either through a vanishing spherical structure factor at low multipole\nnumbers or through a scaling of the cap number variance, in both cases\nextending the Euclidean definition while pointing out crucial differences.

We try to give a microscopic explanation\nfor these phase transitions by adopting Ruppeiner's approach. By studying the\nbehaviors of the Ruppeiner invariant $R$ along the co-existing lines, we find\nthat the various phase transitions may be qualitatively well explained as a\nresult of two competing factors: the first one is the low-temperature effect\nwhich tends to shrink the BH and the second one is the repulsive interaction\nbetween the BH molecules which, on the contrary, tends to expand the BH. In the\nstandard phase transition without RPT, as temperature is lowered, the first\nkind of factor dominates over the second one, so that large black hole (LBH)\ntends to shrink and thus transits to small black hole (SBH); While in the RPT,\nafter the LBH-SBH transition, as temperature is further decreased, the strength\nof the second factor increases quickly and finally becomes strong enough to\ndominate over the first factor, so that SBH tends to expand to release the high\nrepulsion and thus transits back to LBH. Moreover, by comparing the behavior of\n$R$ versus the temperature $T$ with fixed pressure to that of ordinary\ntwo-dimensional thermodynamical systems but with fixed specific volume, it is\ninteresting to see that SBH behaves like a Fermionic gas system in cases with\nRPT, while it behaves oppositely to an anyon system in cases without RPT. And\nin all cases, LBH behaves like a nearly ideal gas system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Dec 2018 11:21:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Jan 2019 02:17:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2019 02:54:31 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2019 01:25:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-09"}

Many recent works have shown that a\ntwo-stage approach, which first detects keypoints and then solves a\nPerspective-n-Point (PnP) problem for pose estimation, achieves remarkable\nperformance. However, most of these methods only localize a set of sparse\nkeypoints by regressing their image coordinates or heatmaps, which are\nsensitive to occlusion and truncation. Instead, we introduce a Pixel-wise\nVoting Network (PVNet) to regress pixel-wise unit vectors pointing to the\nkeypoints and use these vectors to vote for keypoint locations using RANSAC.\nThis creates a flexible representation for localizing occluded or truncated\nkeypoints. Another important feature of this representation is that it provides\nuncertainties of keypoint locations that can be further leveraged by the PnP\nsolver. Experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms the state of\nthe art on the LINEMOD, Occlusion LINEMOD and YCB-Video datasets by a large\nmargin, while being efficient for real-time pose estimation.

However, if the training data is not an\nunbiased sample, then there will be differences between how the training data\nis distributed and how the test data is distributed. Standard classifiers\ncannot cope with changes in data distributions between training and test\nphases, and will not perform well. Domain adaptation and transfer learning are\nsub-fields within machine learning that are concerned with accounting for these\ntypes of changes. Here, we present an introduction to these fields, guided by\nthe question: when and how can a classifier generalize from a source to a\ntarget domain? We will start with a brief introduction into risk minimization,\nand how transfer learning and domain adaptation expand upon this framework.\nFollowing that, we discuss three special cases of data set shift, namely prior,\ncovariate and concept shift. For more complex domain shifts, there are a wide\nvariety of approaches. These are categorized into: importance-weighting,\nsubspace mapping, domain-invariant spaces, feature augmentation, minimax\nestimators and robust algorithms. A number of points will arise, which we will\ndiscuss in the last section. We conclude with the remark that many open\nquestions will have to be addressed before transfer learners and\ndomain-adaptive classifiers become practical.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Dec 2018 14:19:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Jan 2019 13:06:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-15"}

In this paper, we propose a novel Relative Speed Estimation\nAlgorithm (RSEA) of a moving interfering vehicle that approaches a Transmitter\n($Tx$) - Receiver ($Rx$) pair, that interferes with their Radio Frequency (RF)\ncommunication by conducting a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. Our scheme is\ncompletely sensorless and passive and uses a pilot-based received signal\nwithout hardware or computational cost in order to, firstly, estimate the\ncombined channel between the transmitter - receiver and jammer - receiver and\nsecondly, to estimate the jamming signal and the relative speed between the\njammer - receiver using the RF Doppler shift. Moreover, the relative speed\nmetric exploits the Angle of Projection (AOP) of the speed vector of the jammer\nin the axis of its motion in order to form a two-dimensional representation of\nthe geographical area. This approach can effectively be applied both for a\njamming signal completely unknown to the receiver and for a jamming signal\npartly known to the receiver.

In fact,\npointwise interpolation of such solutions is rarely efficient and leads\ngenerally to incorrect results. However, instead of using a straight forward\ninterpolation on solutions, reduced order models can be interpolated. More\nparticularly, Amsallem and Farhat proposed an efficient POD reduced order model\ninterpolation technique based on differential geometry tools. This approach,\nnamed in this paper ITSGM (Interpolation On a Tangent Space of the Grassmann\nManifold), allows through the passage to the tangent space of the Grassmann\nmanifold, to approximate accurately the reduced order basis associated to a new\nuntrained parameter. This basis is used afterwards to build the interpolated\nROM describing the temporal dynamics by performing the Galerkin projection on\nthe high fidelity model. Such Galerkin ROMs require to access to the underlying\nhigh fidelity model, leading by that to intrusive ROMs. In this paper, and\ncontrary to the ITSGM/Galerkin approach, we propose a non-intrusive reduced\norder modeling method which is independent of the governing equations. This\nmethod is named through this paper Bi-CITSGM (Bi-Calibrated ITSGM). It consists\nfirst to interpolate the spatial and temporal POD sampling bases considered as\nrepresentatives of points on Grassmann manifolds, by the ITSGM method. Then,\nthe resulting bases modes are reclassified by introducing two orthogonal\nmatrices. These calibration matrices are determined as analytical solutions of\ntwo optimization problems. Results on the flow problem past a circular cylinder\nwhere the parameter of interpolation is the Reynolds number, show that for new\nuntrained Reynolds number values, the developed approach produces satisfyingly\naccurate solutions in a real computational time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Dec 2018 11:17:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-11"}
